8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,980
ANDREW LO: Well, let me pick
up where we left off last time

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,030
and give you just a very quick
overview of where we're at now,

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,350
because we're on the brink of
a very important set of results

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,290
that I think will change
your perspective permanently

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,410
on risk and expected return.

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,590
Last time, remember, we
looked at this trade-off

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,430
between expected
return and volatility.

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,440
And we made the
argument that when

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,290
you combined a bunch
of different securities

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,200
that are not all
perfectly correlated,

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,890
what you get is this
bullet-shaped curve in terms

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,900
of the possible trade-offs
between that expected return

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,590
and riskiness of various
different portfolios.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,570
So every single dot on
this bullet-shaped curve

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,160
corresponds to a specific
portfolio, or weighting,

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,100
or vector of portfolio
weights, omega.

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,520
So now what I want to ask you to
do for the next lecture or two

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,780
is to exhibit a little
bit of a split personality

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,910
kind of a perspective.

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,860
I'm going to ask you to
look at the geometry of risk

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,400
and expected return,
but at the same time,

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,010
in the back of
your brain, I want

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,100
you to keep in
mind the analytics

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,650
of that set of geometries.

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,960
In other words, I want
you to keep in mind how we

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,080
got this bullet-shaped curve.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,850
The way we got it
was from taking

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,720
different weighted
averages of the securities

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,320
that we have access
to as investments.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,810
So every one of these
points on the bullet

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,970
corresponds to a
specific weighting.

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,680
As you change those
weightings, you

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,740
change the risk and
return characteristics

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,160
of your portfolio.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,150
So the example that I gave
after showing you this

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,440
curve where I argued that the
upper branch of this bullet

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
is where any rational
person would want to be.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,030
And by rational, I've
defined that as somebody

46
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,100
who prefers more expected
return to less, and somebody

47
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,930
who prefers less risk to
more, other things equal.

48
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,380
So if you've got those
kind of preferences,

49
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,600
then you want to be
in the Northeast.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,290
You want to be as north,
sorry, Northwest as possible.

51
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,160
And you would never want to be
down in this lower branch when

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,500
you could be in the upper
branch because you'd

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,570
have a higher expected return
for the same level of risk.

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,590
So after we developed
this basic idea,

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,750
I gave you this
numerical example

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,150
where you've got three
stocks in your universe.

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,240
General Motors,
IBM, and Motorola.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,330
And these are the parameters
that we've estimated

59
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,500
using historical data.

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,150
Now there's going
to be a question,

61
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,300
and we've already raised
that question, of how stable

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,200
are these parameters.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,533
Are they really parameters,
or do they change over time.

64
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,610
And I told you, in reality of
course, they change over time.

65
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,170
But for now, let's play
the game and assume

66
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,790
that they are
constant over time,

67
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,320
and see what we can do
with those parameters.

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,820
So with the means, the
standard deviations,

69
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,090
and most importantly,
the covariance matrix--

70
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,290
So this is the matrix of
variances and covariances--

71
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,010
With these data as
inputs, we can now

72
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,190
construct that
bullet-shaped curve.

73
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,310
The way we do it is of
course, to recognize

74
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,830
that the expected
return of the portfolio

75
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,830
is just a weighted average
of the expected returns

76
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,820
of the component securities,
where the weights are

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,180
our choice variables.

78
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,060
That's what we are
getting to pick,

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,560
is how we allocate
the 100% of our wealth

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,860
to these three
different securities.

81
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,410
And the variance,
of course, is going

82
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,680
to be given by a somewhat more
complicated expression where

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
you have the individual
security variances entering here

84
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,230
from the diagonals.

85
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,320
But you also have the
off diagonal terms

86
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,640
entering in that same
equation for that variance

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,320
of the portfolio.

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,210
And when we put these
two equations together,

89
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,819
the mean and the variance,
and we take the square root

90
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,610
the variance to get
the standard deviation,

91
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,060
and we plot it on a
graph, we get this.

92
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,790
This is the curve, the
bullet-shaped curve,

93
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,430
that we generate just
from three securities,

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,970
and from their covariances.

95
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,650
And where we left
off last time is

96
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,630
that I pointed out a
couple of things that was

97
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,370
interesting about this curve.

98
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,710
One is that unlike the two asset
example, where when you start

99
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,990
with two assets, the
curve, the bullet

100
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,600
goes through the two assets.

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,380
In this case, with
three or more assets,

102
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,430
it's going to turn out
that the bullet is actually

103
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,630
going to include these
assets as special cases,

104
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,950
but they won't be on the curve.

105
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,430
In other words, what
this curve suggests

106
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,460
is that any rational
person is going to want

107
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,490
to be on this upper branch.

108
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,120
What that means is that
it never makes sense

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,430
to put all your money
in one single security.

110
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,630
You see that?

111
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,620
In other words, if we agree that
any rational investor is going

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,730
to want to be on that efficient
frontier, that upper branch,

113
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,340
why would you ever want
to be off of that branch?

114
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,740
You'd like to be Northwest
of that, but you can't.

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,900
You'd never want to
be below that branch,

116
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,050
or to the right of that branch
because you could do better

117
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,310
by being on that branch.

118
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,900
So what this suggests
is that we never

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,510
are going to want
to hold 100% of IBM,

120
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,470
or 100% of General Motors,
or 100% of Motorola.

121
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,360
If we did, we'd
be on those dots,

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,080
and those dots would lie
on that efficient frontier.

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,200
But in fact, they don't.

124
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,660
So right away, we
have now departed

125
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,930
from Warren Buffett's world
of, I want to pick a few stocks

126
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,845
and watch them very,
very carefully.

127
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah, Brian?

128
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,711
AUDIENCE: Would you expand
that to say that you'd never

129
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:35,690
want to invest in less than
three stocks at a given time?

130
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,500
ANDREW LO: That's
not necessarily true.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,120
There are points on
this line where--

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,890
and they may be pathological,
so in other words,

133
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,960
they may be very rare--

134
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,670
but there may be
points on the line

135
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,070
where you are holding two
stocks, but not the third.

136
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,850
So you've got to be
careful about that.

137
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,720
But those are exceptions.

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,170
As a generic statement,
you're absolutely right.

139
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,140
The typical portfolio is going
to have some of all three

140
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,800
of them.

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,080
And if you had four stocks,
the typical portfolio

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,982
would have some of all four.

143
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:05,732
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

144
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:07,190
AUDIENCE: You
answered my question,

145
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,370
which is if you
take one more stock,

146
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,825
you'll always have your package
[INAUDIBLE] n stocks include

147
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:17,785
all the [INAUDIBLE], all the
n stocks so, at the limit

148
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,270
you should have an infinite
number of stocks [INAUDIBLE]

149
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,639
ANDREW LO: Well, let me
put it another way that may

150
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,930
be a little bit more intuitive.

151
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,830
What this diagram suggests--
you guys are already groping

152
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,350
towards--

153
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,870
is the insight that
the more, the merrier.

154
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,880
As you add more stocks, you
cannot make this investor worse

155
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,830
off.

156
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,380
So in other words, I've now
shown you an example with three

157
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,520
stocks, we used to do two.

158
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,720
Is it possible that by
giving you an extra stock

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,365
to invest in, I've
made you worse off?

160
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:53,865
Yeah?

161
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:54,420
AUDIENCE: No

162
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,690
ANDREW LO: Why

163
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,023
AUDIENCE: Because you can
just not invest in that stock.

164
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:57,930
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

165
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,170
I can never make you
worse off in a world

166
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,420
where you're free
to choose, that is.

167
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,900
Because you always have
the option of getting

168
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,630
rid of the stock
that you don't like.

169
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,490
You can always put 0 on it.

170
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,350
So to your point, [INAUDIBLE],
as I add more stocks,

171
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,620
first of all my
risk-reward trade-off

172
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,250
curve will get better.

173
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,032
What does it mean to get better?

174
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,990
What does it mean for
the risk-reward trade-off

175
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,680
to be better?

176
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,490
Yes?

177
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,205
AUDIENCE: It means you
get a higher return

178
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,330
for the same level of risk.

179
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:30,870
ANDREW LO: That's right.

180
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,661
A higher return for
the same level of risk,

181
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,770
or a lower risk for the
same level of return.

182
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,570
In other words, your
upper branch actually

183
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,970
moves to the Northwest.

184
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,559
That's what it
means to get better.

185
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,610
As I add more stocks, this
will move to the Northwest.

186
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,640
And therefore,
you have available

187
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,090
all of the opportunities to
the south and to the east,

188
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,400
but you would never take
those because you're

189
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,110
rational in the
sense that you always

190
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,304
prefer less risk to more,
and more return to less.

191
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:03,804
Yeah?

192
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:06,790
AUDIENCE: If we put all of
the stocks on the index,

193
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,880
on [INAUDIBLE].

194
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,618
And if we looked at all the
possible combinations that--

195
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,326
we can look at them
all at the same time,

196
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,284
but then all the subsets
that you can think of,

197
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:19,290
then you must come up with
some most efficient frontier

198
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,959
in that market.

199
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,000
ANDREW LO: Hold onto that
thought for 10 minutes.

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,375
We're going to
come back to that.

201
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,930
Let's do three first, and
then we could do all of them.

202
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,431
Yeah, Chris?

203
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,763
AUDIENCE: Trying to better
understand Buffett's strategy

204
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:30,740
relative to this one.

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,030
Is the correlation of
these stocks due primarily

206
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,370
to just psychological
factors of the market,

207
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,430
or is it due to
intrinsic correlation?

208
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,290
And then the follow on is when
Buffet says invest in one stock

209
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,623
and just watch it carefully,
isn't that sort of assuming

210
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,507
that the market will
determine at some point

211
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,069
that the stock is
undervalued, and what was he--

212
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,860
ANDREW LO: So those
are two good questions.

213
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,360
Let me take each
of them separately.

214
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,270
Let's first talk
about the correlation.

215
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,440
Why is there correlation?

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,270
We haven't really
talked much about it,

217
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,910
but it turns out that there
are many different arguments

218
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,370
for why there is correlation.

219
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,630
Probably the most compelling
is that a rising tide lifts

220
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,610
all boats, and vice versa.

221
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,800
In other words, when
business conditions are good,

222
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,630
then that helps all companies.

223
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,210
Just like when business
conditions are bad,

224
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,600
it hurts all companies.

225
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,110
So there's some
macroeconomic type

226
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,250
of commonality among businesses
that create correlation.

227
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,345
That's one reason.

228
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,470
But the second reason is
something you pointed out,

229
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,095
which is quite apt, particularly
over the last few weeks, which

230
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,510
is the psychological factor.

231
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,690
When the entire economy
is under stress,

232
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,924
and people are scared
to death about what's

233
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:37,590
going to happen to
the market, what they

234
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,670
will do is withdraw money
in mass from equities

235
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,570
and put them into safer
assets like cash, or treasury

236
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,540
bills, or money market
funds, or whatever

237
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,240
they can do to get to safety.

238
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
So I would say that
the answer is both.

239
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,170
There are good economic reasons
where correlations should exist

240
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,060
among different companies,
but there are also

241
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,030
psychological or behavior
reasons that exacerbate

242
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,530
those kinds of commonalities.

243
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,000
Now your second question about
Buffett versus this approach.

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,620
There's one
fundamental difference

245
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,710
between what Buffett
would say about a company

246
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,150
that he decides to buy versus
how we're approaching it.

247
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,040
The fundamental
difference is that Buffett

248
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,670
would say that he's been able
to identify a severe mispricing.

249
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,800
In other words, he would
argue that markets are not

250
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,880
in equilibrium.

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,580
He would argue that Goldman
Sachs is dramatically

252
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,580
undervalued where it is today.

253
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,790
And seven years from
now, he may be right.

254
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,860
And that's the kind of
time frame he has in mind,

255
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,470
if not longer.

256
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,890
So far, I've made no
such argument at all

257
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,110
about deriving these analyses.

258
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,990
I've not made any argument about
whether prices are good or bad.

259
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,500
In fact, I'm arguing, in
a way, that these prices

260
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,090
I'm taking as given.

261
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,560
And the question
is, what can I do

262
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,570
to construct a good
portfolio irrespective

263
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,270
of whether markets are crazy
or markets are rational.

264
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,490
In a few minutes,
I'm going to argue

265
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,700
that when markets are rational
and in equilibrium, then

266
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,070
there is something
that we can say

267
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,710
about the relationship
between risk and reward

268
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,790
that's extraordinarily sharp and
meaningful from the perspective

269
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,530
of financial decision making.

270
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,056
And then at the
end of the course,

271
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm going to try to
explain to you what

272
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,037
the limitations of that
set of assumptions are.

273
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:31,767
Dennis?

274
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,516
AUDIENCE: Just as we
wouldn't put anything

275
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:37,492
in bond's half of this
frontier, does this graph

276
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,977
imply that we strictly
prefer IBM over GM?

277
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,970
That we pretty much never
weigh anything for GM?

278
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,630
ANDREW LO: Well, from a
risk-reward perspective,

279
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,250
let's take a look.

280
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,520
IBM has a higher
expected rate of return,

281
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,290
and it's got a
higher level of risk.

282
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:01,120
So you really can't say that you
would never prefer GM over IBM,

283
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,050
because GM has lower risk
and lower expected return.

284
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,209
If on the other hand,
GM were over here, then

285
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,000
you would be right.

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,230
Because any point to
the direct Northwest

287
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,310
of a particular point on this
curve is strictly preferred.

288
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,450
And GM and IBM don't
have that relationship.

289
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,750
In other words, the
way you can identify

290
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,900
securities that are dominated
in both dimensions is--

291
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,890
So this is your risk dimension,
this is your expected return

292
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,580
dimension.

293
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,130
Pick a point in this space,
and ask the question,

294
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,240
what are the other
portfolios that are strictly

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,620
preferred to that point.

296
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,420
Well the answer
is pretty simple.

297
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,720
Any portfolio that has higher
expected rate of return

298
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,690
for the same level of
risk, so the vertical line.

299
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,620
Any portfolio that has less
risk for the same level

300
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,030
of expected returns, So
the western direction.

301
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:10,050
And anything in this segment,
that orthant, or quadrant,

302
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,910
is strictly preferred.

303
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,390
So in the case of
IBM, if you draw

304
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,530
the vertical and the horizontal
and ask the question,

305
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,330
does GM lie in that area?

306
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,930
No.

307
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,390
If you do GM, and you
draw the vertical and then

308
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,280
the horizontal
and asked does IBM

309
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,100
lie in that strictly
preferred quadrant?

310
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,820
The answer is no.

311
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,780
So the answer to your
question about IBM versus GM,

312
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,300
no, there isn't any
strict relationship

313
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,970
that would say one would
always dominate the other.

314
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,080
But if GM were here,
then IBM is clearly

315
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,850
contained in that
preferred quadrant.

316
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,210
So then the answer to your
question would be yes.

317
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,670
Yeah, Justin?

318
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,070
AUDIENCE: Theoretically
then, wouldn't everyone just

319
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,270
buy IBM, sell GM,
then wouldn't there

320
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,830
be some sort of
equilibrium where then GM--

321
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,840
ANDREW LO: So the
answer is, it depends

322
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,830
on other things going on.

323
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,595
Everyone would not do that.

324
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:05,970
Everyone would do
something else,

325
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,360
and I'm about to tell you.

326
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,180
So I'm about to
give you the tools

327
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,820
to make that exact
conclusion, and the reason

328
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,670
is that when I show you
what people will do,

329
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,410
that's going to
far dominate what

330
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,960
you think people want to do.

331
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,390
Just with pairs.

332
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,100
So instead of doing
it with pairs,

333
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,980
let's do it with
all the securities,

334
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,570
as Zeke wanted to do.

335
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,320
We're going to do
that in just a minute.

336
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,195
But I want to make sure
everybody understands

337
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,910
this basic framework
first, because we're

338
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,540
going to now start making this
a little bit more complex.

339
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,290
Where we left off at the very
last moment of Wednesday's

340
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,219
lecture was I showed
you this diagram

341
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,260
with the tangency portfolio,
but we hadn't really

342
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,790
gotten to talking about it.

343
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,510
Remember the case where we had
only one risky asset and one

344
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,710
riskless asset, treasury bills?

345
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,420
And in that case, when you
are combining a portfolio

346
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,450
with one risky asset
and one riskless,

347
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,680
you've got a straight line.

348
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,300
It turns out that that
is much more general.

349
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,460
You get a straight line anytime
you combine a riskless asset

350
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,880
with any number of risky assets.

351
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,820
So let me give you an example.

352
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,720
Suppose we picked an
arbitrary portfolio which

353
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,990
is this red dot, p.

354
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,180
And I wanted you
to tell me what is

355
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,400
the risk-reward
possibilities that you

356
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,204
could achieve by mixing
p with treasury bills.

357
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,870
Well, you get that
straight line, right?

358
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,450
We derived that last time.

359
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,680
So any point along the straight
line is what you could achieve,

360
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,820
right?

361
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,010
Anybody tell me
where the portfolio

362
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,890
would be that invests 100%
of your assets in T-Bills?

363
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,300
Where is that on this graph?

364
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

365
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,191
ANDREW LO: Right
this dot right here.

366
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:49,600
How about 100% in portfolio p?

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,930
Right, the red dot over there.

368
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:57,110
How about 25% in
T-Bills, 75% in p?

369
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,189
Where would that lie?

370
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
along the line.

371
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,771
ANDREW LO: It would be
along the line, but where?

372
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,770
Here?

373
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,386
25% T-Bills, 75%--

374
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

375
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,609
ANDREW LO: Right, exactly.

376
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,240
It would be 3/4 of the
way up towards this dot,

377
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,579
because it's 75% of the
risky, 25% of the riskless,

378
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,270
so you're going to get
closer to the risky asset.

379
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,470
OK, great.

380
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,569
So we've now
demonstrated that what

381
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,140
I can achieve as an
investor, just mixing

382
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,110
portfolio p with
the risk-free rate,

383
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,620
is anywhere along that line.

384
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,730
Now this analysis applies
to any portfolio p.

385
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,550
So for example, suppose
I wanted to ask you,

386
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,200
what risk-reward
trade-offs could I

387
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,527
generate by mixing the risk-free
rate with General Motors?

388
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:55,610
What would that look like?

389
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,487
Yeah, Ken?

390
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:07,455
AUDIENCE: The line from
T-Bills through GM.

391
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:08,830
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
that's right.

392
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,788
If I wanted to mix T-Bills
with General Motors,

393
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,270
I get that straight line
right through that dot.

394
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,930
If I wanted to mix T-Bills with
IBM, I'd go through that dot,

395
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,530
with IBM.

396
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,240
If I wanted to mix
T-Bills with Motorola,

397
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,710
I'd go through Motorola.

398
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,210
And if I wanted to mix
T-Bills with any portfolio

399
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,870
on that frontier, on
that upper branch,

400
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,900
it would just be a
line between T-Bills

401
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,330
and that point on
the upper branch.

402
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,080
Right?

403
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,900
So question.

404
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,920
If I were to give you the
choice of mixing T-Bills

405
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:50,242
with only one portfolio,
just one, which would it be?

406
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,200
Which would you prefer?

407
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,525
[INAUDIBLE]?

408
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,900
AUDIENCE: The one where the
line is tangent to the curve.

409
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,816
ANDREW LO: The one where
the line is tangent--

410
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:02,910
so you're talking about
right around here, right?

411
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,380
Somewhere here.

412
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,190
That's where the line is
just tangent to that curve.

413
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,050
Now why is that?

414
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,388
How'd you come up with that?

415
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:12,131
Yeah?

416
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,256
AUDIENCE: If you took
anything below that then it'd

417
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:17,124
be, I would say,
preferable to stay back.

418
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,879
[INAUDIBLE]

419
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:19,670
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

420
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,440
If you picked any
other portfolio

421
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,950
besides the tangency portfolio,
let's pick one and see.

422
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,070
If you picked, let's
say this one right here.

423
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,910
If you drew a line between
this point and that portfolio,

424
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,380
it's going to turn
out that there

425
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,860
are other points over
here that are strictly

426
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,850
in the Northwest of that line,
that you could do better.

427
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,450
There exists only one
portfolio that you

428
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,930
can mix with T-Bills, such that
you can never, ever do better

429
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,050
in terms of generating
risk-reward trade-offs

430
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,670
for everybody that
likes expected return,

431
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,870
and doesn't like risk.

432
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,600
And it turns out that
that portfolio happens

433
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,140
to be the tangency portfolio.

434
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,350
That's the portfolio that
all of you in this room

435
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,646
would love to have.

436
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,270
I don't know anything about you,
I don't know your backgrounds,

437
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,180
I don't know your
risk aversions,

438
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,320
but I don't have to know.

439
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,150
As long as I know that
you like expected return

440
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,900
and you don't like risk,
those are the only assumptions

441
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,590
that I need.

442
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,025
Then I know, all of
you in this room,

443
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,400
are going to want
that portfolio.

444
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,550
You may not be at
that portfolio.

445
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,650
For example, some of
you who don't like risk,

446
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,860
you're going to be down here.

447
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
Those of you who are
budding hedge fund managers,

448
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,390
you're going to be up here.

449
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,710
But the point is, you're
going to be on this line.

450
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,170
You're not going to be
on this line down here.

451
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,670
Why?

452
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,510
Because why be on that line
when you could get higher return

453
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,700
for a given level of
risk, or a lower risk

454
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,400
for a given level of return.

455
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,570
You're giving up something
for no good reason.

456
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,400
So this is a remarkable insight
of modern portfolio theory.

457
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,610
This basically tells
us that regardless

458
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,370
of our differences
in preferences,

459
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,590
as long as we satisfy
the hypothesis

460
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,770
that we like expected return
and we don't like risk, that

461
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,450
means that everybody
in this room

462
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,480
will agree that the only line
that they would ever want

463
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,020
to be on is that tangency line.

464
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,610
Questions?

465
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,812
Ingrid?

466
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:27,758
AUDIENCE: Is there a
particular level of risk

467
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:30,220
that makes you accepting
to the tangency fund?

468
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,450
ANDREW LO: Yes.

469
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,020
In fact, this tangency
portfolio is one very

470
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,060
particular and
special portfolio.

471
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,980
So in other words, it's a
particular weighting of IBM,

472
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,270
General Motors, and
Motorola, that gives you

473
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,078
this particular portfolio.

474
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,034
AUDIENCE: Which one?

475
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:53,340
[INAUDIBLE] something intuitive?

476
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,740
ANDREW LO: It's something
you can solve analytically.

477
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,840
It has a solution, and if we
were using matrix algebra,

478
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,250
I can actually solve it for you.

479
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,830
But it's a little
bit complicated,

480
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,580
so I'm not requiring that
people know how to do that.

481
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,700
Only that you know
that it exists.

482
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,818
Yeah?

483
00:22:11,818 --> 00:22:13,694
AUDIENCE: You go
above the red dot,

484
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:15,570
and into leverage [INAUDIBLE]?

485
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,571
ANDREW LO: Exactly

486
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:19,160
AUDIENCE: So it means that
I have costs for my debt.

487
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,124
ANDREW LO: Yes

488
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:22,394
AUDIENCE: So maybe
some debt, it would

489
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:27,160
be more efficient to buy a
portfolio with other weights--

490
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
ANDREW LO: Yes.

491
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,290
If you assume that there
are borrowing and lending

492
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,780
differences, then obviously
these analyses don't apply.

493
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:44,504
So in particular, if you're
here, you're actually lending.

494
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:46,920
If you're here, you're fully
invested in the stock market.

495
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,020
If you're here,
you're borrowing.

496
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,840
If you're borrowing and
lending rates are different,

497
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,830
then it turns out that the curve
that you want to be on actually

498
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,150
has a kink in it.

499
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,644
And that means that there
is a potential for being

500
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:03,060
on this curve, and then there's
another tangency line that

501
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,740
goes out at a different slope.

502
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,490
That's possible.

503
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,590
But that's more complicated
than what we want

504
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,040
to talk about at this point.

505
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,900
So here I am assuming borrowing
and lending rates are the same.

506
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,000
Zeke, and then Rami.

507
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,220
AUDIENCE: If I had
a choice of, if I

508
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,730
had control over the
volatility of the market,

509
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,470
then if the yield goes
down, of the deals,

510
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,764
then I would want to have
a more volatile market so

511
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:32,364
that I can intersect the curve
at the higher return point.

512
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:33,280
Tangent to the curve--

513
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,238
ANDREW LO: OK, hold on.

514
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:36,450
You're changing the
assumptions here.

515
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,820
Why are you controlling the
volatility of the market?

516
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,460
The volatility of the
market is a data point

517
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,290
that you're basically
using as an input.

518
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,550
OK?

519
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,591
AUDIENCE: I know, I know.

520
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm just trying to figure out
what I am-- because you're

521
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,550
basically connecting, I
see this as a connection

522
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,770
between the yield
curve and the market.

523
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,305
Because it's not only
retrospective in the sense

524
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:57,866
that if the yield
goes down, there's

525
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,420
cash flowing from the market--

526
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,336
ANDREW LO: Let's not
worry about the dynamics.

527
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:03,540
This is not meant to
be a dynamic story.

528
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,390
I didn't say anything about
this happening over time,

529
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,550
and there's lots of
different changes going on.

530
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,270
This is a static snapshot,
today versus next period.

531
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,760
These returns and
covariances and all that

532
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,680
apply to the returns from
this period to the next,

533
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,710
whether it's monthly
or annual, that's

534
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,800
a static snapshot as of today.

535
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,290
So we're not talking about any
term structure effects yet.

536
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,754
Yeah, Rami?

537
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,722
AUDIENCE: This is
assuming three stocks.

538
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:32,362
So if you had four
or five, are you

539
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:34,131
going to actually
move the bullet left?

540
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,380
And then you're gonna change--

541
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,240
ANDREW LO: Yes, absolutely.

542
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,750
If you start adding more
stocks to this cocktail, what's

543
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,290
going to happen is the bullet
is going to shift to the left,

544
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,210
and it's going to shift up.

545
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,630
And so the tangency
point will change.

546
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,380
But the curve, that straight
line, the tangent line,

547
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,700
what you're going to
see is that tangent line

548
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,520
is going to go like that.

549
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,740
The slope, that's right.

550
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,545
You're going to get more
expected return per unit risk.

551
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:07,920
And that is
something we're going

552
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,870
to take as a measure of how good
this particular trade-off is.

553
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,120
We're going to look at
that slope of this line.

554
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,970
And the slope of this
line will give us

555
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,340
a measure of the expected
rate of return per unit risk.

556
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,874
That's exactly what
it's going to do for us.

557
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,762
AUDIENCE: So if you're
in the upper right

558
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,440
beyond the tangency
[INAUDIBLE], you know that line?

559
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,940
Then you're borrowing
[INAUDIBLE] portfolio?

560
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,420
ANDREW LO: That's correct.

561
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,088
AUDIENCE: If you were to
extend the line leftwards, down

562
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:39,171
to the left, would you be
then shorting the market

563
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,047
to invest in T-Bills?

564
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:40,671
ANDREW LO: Yes.

565
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,710
And if that happens, you
know what you would do?

566
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,970
It would not go this
way, because of course

567
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,860
standard deviation
can't be negative.

568
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,950
It would go like this.

569
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,680
It would go this way.

570
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,809
Because standard deviation
is always non-negative.

571
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,350
It's the square root
of the variance,

572
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,670
which is always positive.

573
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,290
So if you decided to short
the tangency portfolio

574
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,540
and put it in T-Bills, well,
you'd be a knucklehead.

575
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,360
But you would be on
this line right here.

576
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,270
You would have higher and
higher risk, because you're

577
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,790
taking a short
position on equities,

578
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,470
and you'd have a
lower and lower return

579
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,303
because you're shorting
the high yield asset

580
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,680
and buying the low yield asset.

581
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,690
Any other questions about
the geometry of this point.

582
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,770
It's very important,
this is a major insight.

583
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,664
Yeah?

584
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:31,330
AUDIENCE: Earlier we
discussed about how

585
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,676
we bring market [INAUDIBLE]
portfolios and expected return

586
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,384
changes as a function of
n and standard deviation

587
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:39,950
from certain changes [INAUDIBLE]

588
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,778
ANDREW LO: Yes.

589
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:43,560
AUDIENCE: Is that the reason why
the shift is more towards left?

590
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,410
Because as we add more
and more portfolios,

591
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,940
the n dominates the [INAUDIBLE]?

592
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,523
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

593
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:52,560
As we add more securities,
you get more and more impact

594
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,550
of diversification.

595
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,950
So that increases your expected
rate of return per unit risk

596
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,110
because you can't make
somebody worse off

597
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,000
by giving them choices.

598
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,610
They can always put a
0 for the new stocks

599
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,690
that you give them if
they don't like it.

600
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,070
So the only thing you can do is
to make you better off, meaning

601
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,930
the only thing you
can do is to give you

602
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,750
a higher level of expected
return per unit risk,

603
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,560
or a lower level of risk
per unit of expected return.

604
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,870
So by adding more
securities, you're

605
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,290
basically increasing
the slope of this line.

606
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,840
So let's talk about
the slope of the line.

607
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,450
The slope of that line is
equal to the expected return

608
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,010
of that tangency portfolio,
minus the T-Bill rate, divided

609
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,460
by the volatility of
that tangency portfolio.

610
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,890
If you just calculate
rise over run,

611
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,990
that's what you
get as the slope.

612
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,370
There's a name for this.

613
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,290
The name for this is
called the Sharpe ratio.

614
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,970
You may have heard
of this, particularly

615
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,620
those of you who have interest
in hedge fund investments.

616
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,700
Hedge fund managers will often
quote their Sharpe ratio very

617
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,930
proudly.

618
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,330
The Sharpe ratio
is simply a measure

619
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,950
of that risk-reward trade-off.

620
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,950
The higher the Sharpe ratio,
the better you're doing.

621
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,070
If you're a mean variance
optimizer, meaning you

622
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,440
prefer more expected
return and less risk.

623
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,720
So the idea behind
the tangency portfolio

624
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,610
is that it is the one
that will give you

625
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,320
the highest Sharpe ratio.

626
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,760
Let's look at it again.

627
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,820
If you pick a portfolio
like here, take a look.

628
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,730
Look at the slope.

629
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,060
The slope is going to be lower.

630
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,750
Take a point over here,
in the inefficient branch

631
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,740
of the bullet.

632
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,300
Then the slope is
going to be even

633
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,250
lower than the upper branch.

634
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:47,330
The biggest slope occurs when
you invest between T-Bills

635
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,370
and that tangency portfolio.

636
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,282
That's what you're optimizing.

637
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,746
Yeah?

638
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:58,674
AUDIENCE: I have a
hard time understanding

639
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:03,570
why the bullet would go left
when I add additional stocks.

640
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,300
I understand it analytically,
standard deviation goes down.

641
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,499
But then on the other
hand, wouldn't it

642
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:16,030
happen that the
likelihood of correlation

643
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,509
between these
additional stocks would

644
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,765
decrease and therefore as we--

645
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:24,640
ANDREW LO: How would
the correlation increase

646
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,870
by adding another stock?

647
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,160
AUDIENCE: I mean the likelihood
that I have 20 stocks,

648
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,312
the overall correlation is
higher rather than [INAUDIBLE]

649
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:36,520
ANDREW LO: How could that be?

650
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,310
You've got 20
stocks, and they've

651
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,470
got a correlation
among those 20 stocks.

652
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,730
Now, I want you to think
about adding a 21st stock.

653
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,980
When you add that
21st stock, you

654
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,380
don't affect the existing
correlations, right?

655
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,540
I mean, it is whatever it is.

656
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,950
Those are parameters.

657
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,790
At least for now, we're going
to call them parameters.

658
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,330
When I add my 21st stock,
I'm giving the investor

659
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,840
an extra degree of freedom.

660
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,460
Now instead of investing
among 20 securities,

661
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm going to let
you invest among 21.

662
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,772
You don't have to
invest in the 21st.

663
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:13,230
Or another way of
thinking about it

664
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,590
is that when you
only had 20 stocks,

665
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,710
you really had 21
portfolio weights.

666
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,870
But the 21st weight,
I've arbitrarily

667
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,320
constrained to be 0.

668
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,630
Now, I'm going to
loosen the constraint

669
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,070
and I'm going to
say, OK, now you

670
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,390
can invest in the 21st stock.

671
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,340
You won't affect the
existing correlations,

672
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,900
but the new stock
that you add in

673
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,320
can benefit in providing
additional diversification

674
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,820
benefits.

675
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,507
AUDIENCE: But as a
general rule, we've

676
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,467
always been trying to have
negative correlation so

677
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:46,515
that the bullet was left.

678
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:47,890
ANDREW LO: Oh,
well actually, you

679
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,210
don't need a
negative correlation

680
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,751
to make this go to
the left, you just

681
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,540
need to have
something less than 1.

682
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,200
Remember?

683
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,440
From the last lecture?

684
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,000
This is a case where you
had perfect correlation.

685
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,850
Anything less than
perfect correlation,

686
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,850
brings you to the left.

687
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,180
So as long as my
21st stock is not

688
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,670
perfectly correlated
with the existing

689
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,400
stocks in that
portfolio of 20, I'm

690
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,894
going to move
things to the left.

691
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:17,190
AUDIENCE: In general,
[INAUDIBLE] any stocks?

692
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,690
ANDREW LO: In
general, that is true.

693
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,440
AUDIENCE: I mean I would try to
have the negative correlation.

694
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,690
ANDREW LO: You would,
but what this suggests

695
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,820
is that negative correlation
is a very rare thing.

696
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,690
AUDIENCE: It's difficult.

697
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,064
ANDREW LO: It's very difficult,
it's extremely difficult.

698
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:32,760
Now, from the
analytical perspective,

699
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,260
we can conclude
it's very difficult.

700
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,440
Let me ask you from an
economic perspective,

701
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,680
why is it difficult to find
a stock that's negatively

702
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,540
correlated with
all other stocks?

703
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,350
Anybody give me a business
rationale for that?

704
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,502
Yeah, Ingrid?

705
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:49,150
AUDIENCE: There's
what you said before

706
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,004
that when the economy goes
down, everything goes down

707
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:52,980
and we get vice versa.

708
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,082
Just that we mention
[INAUDIBLE] different countries,

709
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,435
in different economic regions,
in different industry,

710
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,740
and they should not be--

711
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,990
ANDREW LO: Let's actually
spend a little bit more time

712
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,020
thinking about this.

713
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,770
I want you guys to tell
me right now, give me

714
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,440
a stock that you would put
your money in right now, today.

715
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,640
S&P has gone down by 45% since
the high several months ago.

716
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,500
The stock market's
doing terribly,

717
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,610
and it doesn't look like
it's getting any better.

718
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,860
So you tell me, what stock
would you put your money in

719
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,090
right now, today?

720
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:25,707
Yeah, Terry.

721
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:26,790
AUDIENCE: Campbell's Soup.

722
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,470
ANDREW LO: Campbell's Soup.

723
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,380
Why is that?

724
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,546
AUDIENCE: It's a food stock.

725
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:35,848
It's a foodstuff people need,
will purchase, inexpensive,

726
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,300
pretty much just for--

727
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,760
ANDREW LO: OK.

728
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,440
But on the other hand, if
people are poorer all around,

729
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,650
might not they start consuming
even less of canned soup

730
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,680
and try to make their own soup
from little packages of ketchup

731
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,390
and hot water?

732
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,580
I saw that on an I Love
Lucy episode years ago.

733
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,980
It's pretty cool.

734
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,286
So are you sure?

735
00:32:58,286 --> 00:32:59,660
Are you sure that
Campbell's Soup

736
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,250
is going to go up over
the next few months,

737
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,720
in response to the
current crisis?

738
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,332
AUDIENCE: It'll
stay pretty stable.

739
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:06,540
ANDREW LO: It'll stay stable.

740
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,210
Ah, but that's not
negative correlation.

741
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,812
That's 0 correlation.

742
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:12,270
I want something
that's going to go

743
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,300
the opposite direction of
where the economy is heading.

744
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,690
Tell me where that is?

745
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,770
Yeah?

746
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
short financials.

747
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:22,740
ANDREW LO: OK, fine.

748
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,240
So you're going to
short the market.

749
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,850
That's a cheap answer.

750
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,610
Sorry, you don't get
any credit for that.

751
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,200
I want to answer
the question that

752
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,690
was raised by David
which is, show me

753
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,260
a stock that can get me
even more to that left.

754
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,990
I want a negatively
correlated stock.

755
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,090
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

756
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,230
AUDIENCE: Wal-Mart.

757
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,890
ANDREW LO: Wal-Mart?

758
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,255
AUDIENCE: It's been going up.

759
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,130
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
not the same thing

760
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,644
as saying that it
is going to go up

761
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:50,310
over the next several
months in response

762
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,310
to this economic crisis.

763
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,726
You don't think
that there's going

764
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:54,300
to be a decline in
consumer spending

765
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,570
that will affect retail as well?

766
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,650
AUDIENCE: So far, everybody's
going to Wal-Mart.

767
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,900
If they don't go to Wal-Mart,
where would they go?

768
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
what I'm asking you.

769
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,750
Where are you going to go?

770
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,458
So you're telling me
now that you believe

771
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,848
that Wal-Mart is the answer?

772
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,639
You think it will be
negatively correlated?

773
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,382
Historically, just
to let you know,

774
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,090
retail has not been
negatively correlated

775
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,835
with the business cycle.

776
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:15,460
Yeah, Zeke?

777
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,011
AUDIENCE: What
about Freddie Mac?

778
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:17,969
ANDREW LO: Freddie Mac?

779
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:18,594
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

780
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:22,165
[LAUGHTER]

781
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,790
ANDREW LO: If you
like that investment,

782
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,870
I have something else for you--

783
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,712
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

784
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,554
--afterwards.

785
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:28,482
AUDIENCE: We could
do it this time.

786
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:29,940
ANDREW LO: I don't
know if you want

787
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,159
to argue that Freddie Mac
is negatively correlated

788
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,076
with market downturns.

789
00:34:33,076 --> 00:34:35,409
I mean, the reason that Freddie
Mac got into the trouble

790
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,504
that it did was because
of the economic downturn.

791
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:38,625
All right, one more.

792
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,380
[INAUDIBLE]?

793
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,779
AUDIENCE: Philip Morris.

794
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:41,820
ANDREW LO: Philip Morris.

795
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,250
That's an interesting one.

796
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,050
Obviously, people
are very nervous now.

797
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,230
When you're nervous,
you're going to be smoking.

798
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,940
On the other hand,
again, one could

799
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,580
argue that it's not
negatively correlated.

800
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,100
It might be either slightly
positively correlated,

801
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,200
but even there,
people have argued

802
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,350
that cigarettes are a
consumption good that can get

803
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,724
hit with a downturn in markets.

804
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,390
The bottom line is
that it's really hard

805
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,832
to come up with negative
correlated stocks.

806
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:17,040
Let me tell you, if you
found one that was negatively

807
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,490
correlated, if you found
one that was really, really,

808
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,112
negatively correlated,
what would all of you do?

809
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:23,820
AUDIENCE: Buy it.

810
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,310
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
you'd buy it.

811
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,210
The effect of that would
be to increase the price

812
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,570
and depress the expected return.

813
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,160
Remember what the
expected return is.

814
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,270
It's the expected future price,
divided by the current price.

815
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,150
If now all of you go
out and buy Wal-Mart,

816
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,900
or whatever stock you think
is negatively correlated,

817
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,990
that would have the impact of
increasing the current price

818
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,164
and therefore decreasing
the expected return.

819
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:53,580
Now if you have a
stock that's got

820
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,821
a negative covariance
and a negative return,

821
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,570
that doesn't help.

822
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,340
Because in fact,
that was a suggestion

823
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,660
that was put forward here.

824
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,960
Let's just take the
S&P and short it,

825
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,280
and then you get a
negatively correlated stock.

826
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,000
The problem is that it's also
got a negative expected return

827
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,306
and then you're
not helping things.

828
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:12,930
The key is to find
negative correlation

829
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,100
with a positive return.

830
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,410
If you can find
that, then you've

831
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,110
really found
something worthwhile.

832
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,830
But my guess is it won't
last, for exactly this reason.

833
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,420
Other questions?

834
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,650
OK, so now, let's go back
and ask the question, what

835
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,920
does this mean if we
agree that all of us

836
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,920
want to be on that
tangency portfolio.

837
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,940
What does that tell us?

838
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,250
Well, that allows us to
then make an argument

839
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,170
that managers that are
trying to provide value

840
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,560
added services for us, they
need to be doing something above

841
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,700
and beyond what we
can do ourselves.

842
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,280
Now, here's where Warren Buffett
meets modern finance theory,

843
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,090
in a way.

844
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,740
If I want to see
whether or not Warren

845
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,290
Buffett or any other
managers are adding value,

846
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,990
one simple criterion that
I can put forward is this.

847
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,960
This Is what I can do on my own.

848
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,240
I can get that line pretty much
by just using my basic finance

849
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,670
skills that I've
learned here at MIT.

850
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,570
If you're going to manage my
money and charge me 2 and 20,

851
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,420
show me what you can do
above and beyond this.

852
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,720
I want you to tell me where
you can get me on this graph.

853
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,870
Can you get me up here?

854
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,540
Can you get me over here?

855
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,690
Can you get me anywhere
either to the left

856
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,850
or above that curve?

857
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,650
We can use that as a
measure of performance,

858
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,680
and there's a name for that.

859
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,910
It's called Alpha.

860
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,980
Typically, when people
talk about Alpha,

861
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,022
they're talking about deviations
from a line like this.

862
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,730
We're going to get to
that more formally,

863
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,230
you don't have to write it down
or make note of it just yet.

864
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,544
It's on the next slide.

865
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:59,960
But we're going to show you
how to measure that explicitly

866
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,460
so now, not only is this a
good idea for you as a baseline

867
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,310
to manage your own
portfolio, but you can then

868
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,650
use it as a metric to gauge
whether other people are

869
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,220
adding value to you.

870
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,780
So Warren Buffett
would say, no problem.

871
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,310
I think I've got Alpha.

872
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,110
So I'm not going to
bother with this,

873
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,710
I think I can get you up here.

874
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,320
That is, if you want
to invest with me.

875
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,380
And in fact, if you looked at
Warren Buffett's performance

876
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,310
over the last 25 years that
he's been doing it, or 30 years,

877
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:36,250
his Sharpe ratio is a lot better
than the tangency portfolios.

878
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,420
So he actually has added value
if you use this as a criterion.

879
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,780
But the problem is, you
have to identify the Warren

880
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,171
Buffetts before they
become Warren Buffetts.

881
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:47,920
Because after they
become Warren Buffetts,

882
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,030
it's not clear
that they're adding

883
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,350
the same amount of value.

884
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,490
It's already, the
cat's out of the bag.

885
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,028
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

886
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:55,819
AUDIENCE: Question
about the Sharpe ration.

887
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:57,996
So is this a stag
ratio, or is it dynamic?

888
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:02,956
Because in my mind, as you
gain more stock options,

889
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:04,227
it's going to become sharper.

890
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:04,810
ANDREW LO: Yes

891
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,175
AUDIENCE: Opportunity cost
for switching to T-Bills

892
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:08,712
is going to be
greater, so you're

893
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,587
going to shift preferences
away from T-Bills.

894
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:13,230
Then isn't that point going
to increase and flatten out?

895
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,350
ANDREW LO: Yes, so the dynamics
of this are very complex.

896
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,060
This is, right now,
a static theory.

897
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,700
Static meaning today
versus next period.

898
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,534
We're not looking at
the dynamics over time.

899
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,783
In order to do that, there's
lots of different effects

900
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,540
that are much, much
more complicated.

901
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,010
For that, you've really
got to take 15 433

902
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,680
and even 433 won't cover
those kinds of questions

903
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,850
in complete detail because they
rely on some very complex kinds

904
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,444
of analysis.

905
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,110
But I'm going to get
to that at the end.

906
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,500
So if I don't, please
bring it up again.

907
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,390
I want to make a
comment about that,

908
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,630
and how you can take this
relatively simple static theory

909
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,240
and make it dynamic
in an informal way

910
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,790
even though the analytics
become very hard when

911
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,640
you try to do it formally.

912
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,840
So the key points of this
lecture are, oh, sorry,

913
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,076
question?

914
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:02,850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
every point on the line,

915
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,230
it's indifferent?

916
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,865
Or--

917
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:05,740
ANDREW LO: No, no no.

918
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,870
Not at all, not at
all indifferent.

919
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,900
Any point on this line is
a different risk-reward

920
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,040
combination.

921
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,162
So in other words, it
depends on your preferences.

922
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,120
AUDIENCE: You take a
function for the industry?

923
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,020
ANDREW LO: Yes, yes.

924
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,450
Now, we haven't talked
about utility functions yet,

925
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,380
but we're going to
in a little while.

926
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,790
Let me preview that,
since you asked.

927
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,370
You all remember what
indifference curves are?

928
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,380
From basic economics?

929
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,110
An indifference curve, when
I first came across that,

930
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:36,070
I was rather offended
because I don't view myself

931
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,990
as an indifferent individual.

932
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,820
I have lots of passions.

933
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,666
And so, why should we be
indifferent about two choices?

934
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,040
In fact, that's
an economic term.

935
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,000
It simply means that you are
just as well off between two

936
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,430
combinations and
therefore, these two

937
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,600
combinations you're indifferent
to, you're indifferent between.

938
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,690
So if I had to ask you to draw
on this graph, an indifference

939
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,501
curve of risk-reward
trade-offs for you,

940
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:08,500
the typical individual,
what would it look like?

941
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,650
Can anybody give me a sense
of what different kinds

942
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,880
of risk-reward trade-offs you
would be indifferent among?

943
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,790
And to make the question
a little bit simpler,

944
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,890
let's start off with
a particular point.

945
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,780
So let's suppose that
this point right here

946
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,450
is the point that I want
you to draw the indifferent

947
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,610
curve from.

948
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,570
Which is a standard deviation
on a monthly basis of about 6%,

949
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:38,180
and an expected return of
about, say 1.4% or something.

950
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:45,780
So you've got a monthly return
of 1.4% and a risk of about 6%.

951
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,760
Give me another point that you
would be indifferent between,

952
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,560
versus that one?

953
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,640
Anybody?

954
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,480
Any volunteers?

955
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:01,899
Yeah?

956
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:06,640
AUDIENCE: There could be a
point above the tangent line,

957
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,607
but to your right.

958
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:08,940
Somewhere where you're pointing.

959
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,580
ANDREW LO: OK, so do you have
a particular number in mind?

960
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,760
In other words, let
me ask you this.

961
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,524
If I cranked up your
volatility from 6% to 8%,

962
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:19,940
how much extra
return would I have

963
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,898
to give you in order for
you to be just as well

964
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:26,299
off as you were at 6% and 1.4%?

965
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:28,340
AUDIENCE: Something slightly
higher than the 1.8%

966
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,720
[INAUDIBLE].

967
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,430
ANDREW LO: OK,
higher than 1.8% OK.

968
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,353
AUDIENCE: Or what about
the corresponding value.

969
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:35,853
1.41%.

970
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,790
1.41%

971
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,940
ANDREW LO: OK, this is 1.41%.

972
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,670
And if I said, now
I want to be at 8%,

973
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,171
how much risk do I
have to give you,

974
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,586
how much expected return do I
have to give you to make you

975
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:49,180
just as well off as this point?

976
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,390
AUDIENCE: Higher
then 1.2%, right?

977
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,097
Or 1.4%, higher than 1.4%.

978
00:42:56,097 --> 00:42:57,680
ANDREW LO: Right,
but how much higher?

979
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,513
That's the question.

980
00:42:58,513 --> 00:42:59,701
It's a personal question.

981
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:00,200
Rami?

982
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,190
AUDIENCE: 1.3 times your
initial expected return.

983
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,746
So 33% on top.

984
00:43:06,746 --> 00:43:08,120
ANDREW LO: You
would have to have

985
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,150
an increase in 33% of
your expected return,

986
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,134
even though I'm only giving
you a 25% increase in the risk.

987
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,118
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

988
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:19,316
You'd have to at least
do 25% of the-- sorry.

989
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:20,494
Put 6%-8% is--

990
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:22,160
ANDREW LO: That's a
third, you're right.

991
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,990
So I'm increasing
the risk by 1/3,

992
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,510
you want me to increase
the expected return by 1/3.

993
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,580
So your trade-off is
linear, is that right?

994
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,040
You're looking at it linearly?

995
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,404
Anybody else?

996
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,070
You know, you may
want to translate this

997
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,630
into annual numbers.

998
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,480
Because I'm sensing that
you may not have a good

999
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,520
feel for what your
own preferences are.

1000
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,260
And by the way,
this is a challenge.

1001
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,370
Not everybody understands what
their own personal preferences

1002
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,970
are for these numbers.

1003
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,230
This is not a natural
act of human nature,

1004
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:55,670
that we automatically have
preferences on these numbers.

1005
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,770
But the bottom line is that
if I make you take more risk,

1006
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,020
I'm going to have to
compensate you and give you

1007
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,960
more expected return.

1008
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,980
There's got to be a reason why
you want to take that risk.

1009
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,486
For some people, it's linear.

1010
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,360
For other people, it's
much more than linear.

1011
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,943
They don't want to
take any more risk.

1012
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:14,140
In fact, right
now most investors

1013
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,320
don't even want to
answer that question.

1014
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,070
Because they don't
want to take more risk.

1015
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,160
And you say, well
what if you did?

1016
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,210
Well I don't want to.

1017
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,330
Well, but just what if?

1018
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,330
I don't want to what if.

1019
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,460
I just don't want
to take the risk.

1020
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,290
So they can't even
answer that question.

1021
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,450
But if they could, my guess is
that it would be way up here.

1022
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,960
So you'd have to give them
a lot of expected return

1023
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,360
to make people take
more risk today.

1024
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,480
Alternatively, if you want
to give people less risk,

1025
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,040
my guess is that
you can actually

1026
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,610
subtract a lot of return
in order to take away

1027
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,640
a little bit of risk.

1028
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,620
How do I know that?

1029
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,828
Take a look at the yield on
the three month treasury.

1030
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,370
So an indifference curve.

1031
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,730
It's going to look like this.

1032
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,530
It's going to look like
it'll be increasing,

1033
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,680
but it'll actually
be bowed this way.

1034
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,940
And the theory behind why
it's going to be convex,

1035
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,240
holds water as opposed
to spills water,

1036
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,880
the reason it's
going to be convex

1037
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,000
is because there is a
decreasing, or diminishing,

1038
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,600
marginal utility between risk
and expected rate of return.

1039
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,420
Like anything else,
economists have this notion

1040
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,320
of diminishing marginal utility
between any two commodities.

1041
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:29,040
If you've got ice cream
sundaes and basketballs,

1042
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,750
there's only so many
basketballs that you

1043
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,380
can enjoy before the next
incremental basketball provides

1044
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,240
relatively little
pleasure for you.

1045
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,890
The same thing with
ice cream sundaes.

1046
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,870
You can only consume so
many ice cream sundaes

1047
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,990
before the next
incremental sundae provides

1048
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,840
somewhat less benefit to you.

1049
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,480
That kind of diminishing
marginal utility

1050
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,700
gives you this kind
of a bowed curve.

1051
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,250
So where you are on
this straight line

1052
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,070
depends upon how
bowed your curve is.

1053
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,430
Somebody that's really
risk-averse has a curve that

1054
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,930
looks--

1055
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,971
let me draw this because
it's a little bit easier

1056
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:04,230
to see rather than trying
to follow my laser pointer.

1057
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,650
So here's the trade-off,
this is the line.

1058
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,570
Somebody that's
extremely risk-averse

1059
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,355
is going to have
curves like this.

1060
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,310
Those are indifference curves.

1061
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,640
And as you go to the Northwest,
you're happier and happier.

1062
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,140
So the optimal point is
where this indifference curve

1063
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,970
hits this particular line.

1064
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,970
On the other hand, if
you're very risk-seeking,

1065
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,980
if you don't need a
lot of compensation

1066
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,205
of expected return
per unit risk,

1067
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:41,580
then your difference curve's
not going to look like that.

1068
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,420
It's going to look like this.

1069
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,970
In which case, you're
tangency point will be farther

1070
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,620
to the Northeast.

1071
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,600
You'll be taking
more risk and getting

1072
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,630
more expected rates of return.

1073
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,180
But the bottom line for
this graph and this lecture

1074
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,395
is that everybody, no matter
what your risk preferences are,

1075
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:07,270
everybody's going to
want to be on that line,

1076
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,570
that tangency line.

1077
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,020
And it turns out
that that insight

1078
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,070
is going to translate into
a remarkable, remarkable

1079
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:21,140
conclusion about
risk-reward trade-offs.

1080
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,590
So the key points
for this lecture

1081
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,110
are diversification
reduces risk.

1082
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,600
In diversified
portfolios, covariances

1083
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,940
are the most important
characteristics

1084
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,840
of that portfolio.

1085
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,150
It's not the variances,
but the covariances.

1086
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,250
Investors should try
to hold portfolios

1087
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,920
on the efficient frontier,
that upper branch.

1088
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,160
And with the riskless
asset, everybody

1089
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,790
is going to want to be
on the tangency line.

1090
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,715
Those are the major
conclusions from this analysis.

1091
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:53,590
And you can work all of
this out analytically

1092
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,320
using the mathematics
of optimization theory,

1093
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,080
but in fact, all of this
can be done graphically

1094
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,935
as we have geometrically.

1095
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,071
Question, [INAUDIBLE]?

1096
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:07,487
AUDIENCE: Sorry, this is sort
of a simple-minded question,

1097
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:12,928
but I'm having trouble thinking
of the expected return.

1098
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:20,188
I know it's absolute, but
so much of the portfolio

1099
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:24,060
metrics, I guess, are relative
to the benchmark of the market

1100
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,512
rather than [INAUDIBLE].

1101
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:26,480
So I don't know.

1102
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,360
ANDREW LO: OK, so we're
going to get to that.

1103
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,485
We're going to talk about
benchmarks because you're

1104
00:48:30,485 --> 00:48:34,370
right, that most investments
today are all benchmarked

1105
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,470
against something, right?

1106
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,830
And you're probably
wondering how that got to be.

1107
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:45,810
That whole direction of analysis
and performance attribution,

1108
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,805
that came out of this.

1109
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:49,180
In other words,
it was because of

1110
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,040
this particular
academic framework

1111
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,560
that was developed by
Harry Markowitz, and Bill

1112
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,380
Sharpe, and others,
that indexation

1113
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,494
and benchmarking came to be.

1114
00:48:58,494 --> 00:48:59,660
So I'm going to get to that.

1115
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,050
Let me put that off for
another lecture or so.

1116
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,260
After we derive the implications
of everybody wanting

1117
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,210
to hold the tangency
portfolio, it's

1118
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,510
going to turn out that that
tangency portfolio happens

1119
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,740
to be the benchmark.

1120
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,020
So we'll get to that.

1121
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,639
Yeah?

1122
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:16,014
AUDIENCE: Is there
any assumption

1123
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:19,402
behind all this
analysis that would say,

1124
00:49:19,402 --> 00:49:21,338
if you have these
preferences, then you

1125
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:24,242
should choose this portfolio.

1126
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:28,320
If everyone did that, does
that change [INAUDIBLE]

1127
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,980
ANDREW LO: So you would think
that it would, but in fact,

1128
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,610
I'm going to show you that there
is exactly one case where it

1129
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,167
doesn't.

1130
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,750
And that's the case
of the equilibrium

1131
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,240
that I'm about describe.

1132
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,010
So let me turn to
that right now.

1133
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,120
There any other questions?

1134
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,369
AUDIENCE: We've been using
risk and standard deviation

1135
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:44,260
kind of interchangeably,
whereas I

1136
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,438
think of risk as the risk
of not making anything.

1137
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:49,188
Is there a way to
mathematically translate

1138
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:50,987
from a standard deviation
in your portfolio

1139
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,570
to the risk of not
making [INAUDIBLE]?

1140
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,580
ANDREW LO: Well, there is.

1141
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,410
Although, I would have
to say that if you

1142
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,010
have a preference
about the downside,

1143
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,240
so not making anything
as you point out.

1144
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Then that changes this analysis.

1145
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,370
So this analysis really requires
that you use standard deviation

1146
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,270
as the sum total
of your perception

1147
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,310
of the risk of a portfolio.

1148
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,890
If you have other
kinds of sensitivities,

1149
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,170
then you need to bring
them into the analysis,

1150
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,668
and that will change
these outcomes.

1151
00:50:22,668 --> 00:50:25,720
AUDIENCE: The way
we do this, if we

1152
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,998
measure the risk of a company,
if they're historically--

1153
00:50:30,998 --> 00:50:31,962
Nevermind.

1154
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,372
I guess if they
were historically,

1155
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:37,060
they varied higher, if that
wasn't strictly normal,

1156
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,820
and they end up being higher
in market [INAUDIBLE] lower,

1157
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,647
they would still have
a larger deviation

1158
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:46,383
so you're correlating that
with companies that are also

1159
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,784
[INAUDIBLE].

1160
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:48,730
Does that make sens?

1161
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,438
ANDREW LO: That's
true, but again, you've

1162
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,684
made an assumption there
that I'm not making.

1163
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:54,850
Which is you're assuming
companies are outperforming

1164
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,230
or underperforming.

1165
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,300
I'm assuming that
the data are given,

1166
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,790
and I'm not making a bet on
whether any companies are

1167
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,830
likely to succeed or fail.

1168
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,040
I'm merely looking at companies
as investment opportunities

1169
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,410
that provide certain
expected returns,

1170
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,682
volatilities, and covariances.

1171
00:51:10,682 --> 00:51:12,640
You want to go down the
path of Warren Buffett,

1172
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,290
and I'm resisting that
because I don't have

1173
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,581
the skills of a Warren Buffett.

1174
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:17,200
So I don't know
what's a good value

1175
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,820
and what's not a good value.

1176
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,180
And the case in point is a
discussion we just had today.

1177
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,805
You tell me what is
a good value today?

1178
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,300
Do you really believe that
Campbell's Soup or Wal-Mart

1179
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,370
should be the companies
you invest in today?

1180
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,171
I don't know.

1181
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,920
I mean, another argument
is entertainment.

1182
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,300
Why don't you invest
in movie theaters?

1183
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,730
Lots of people now are going
to see the James Bond movie,

1184
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,362
and they want to
escape from reality.

1185
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:36,820
Wouldn't that be
a growth industry,

1186
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,780
given market conditions?

1187
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,363
Well, that's true,
but how many people

1188
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:40,594
have $12 to spend on a movie?

1189
00:51:40,594 --> 00:51:42,760
Plus, you've got to get the
popcorn and the bonbons,

1190
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,343
and all those.

1191
00:51:43,343 --> 00:51:46,570
And by the time you're done,
it's like a $60 evening.

1192
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,770
I mean, I don't know.

1193
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,720
So the point is
that unless you are

1194
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,630
willing to make
predictions, this

1195
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,960
is the only alternative
that provides a disciplined

1196
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,630
approach to investing in
so-called good portfolios.

1197
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,690
So it's a different approach.

1198
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,220
So now, let me turn
to the next lectures.

1199
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,040
Lectures 15 through 17,
where we're now going

1200
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,480
to talk about equilibrium.

1201
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,800
We've already identified
that all of us in this room,

1202
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,370
assuming we have mean
variance preferences, that's

1203
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,800
an important
assumption, I grant you,

1204
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,420
but it's not an
unreasonable one.

1205
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,895
It's just, it is an
important assumption.

1206
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:31,270
We've all agreed
that we're going

1207
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:37,900
to take on portfolios that lie
on that line, and therefore,

1208
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,470
the portfolio that is
the tangency portfolio,

1209
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,930
I'm going to give
it a special name.

1210
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:50,990
I'm going to call it M,
portfolio M. What we now

1211
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:56,780
know is that, given a
choice between holding n

1212
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:04,940
securities and
T-Bills, versus holding

1213
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:11,030
T-Bills and a single
portfolio, all of you

1214
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,710
would be indifferent
between those two choices,

1215
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:21,470
if that single portfolio were
M. The tangency portfolio.

1216
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,270
Do we agree on that?

1217
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,230
So therefore, I
could, in principle,

1218
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:35,110
construct a mutual fund called
M. This mutual fund holds

1219
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:39,610
stocks in exact proportion
to the weights given

1220
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,740
by that tangency portfolio.

1221
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:46,800
In other words, it is
the tangency portfolio.

1222
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,730
So what that suggests is
that all of you in this room

1223
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:57,010
would be absolutely indifferent
between investing among the n

1224
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,470
stocks and T-Bills
on the one hand,

1225
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,530
versus investing in two
securities on the other.

1226
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,380
One security is T-Bills,
and the other security

1227
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:12,560
is shares of mutual fund
M. Do we agree on that?

1228
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,540
Any controversy there?

1229
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,480
I know I've made a number of
assumptions to get us here,

1230
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,510
but given mean variance
preferences, which is not

1231
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,460
an unreasonable
assumption, and given

1232
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,830
that we've assumed
these parameters are

1233
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,516
stable over time,
that's where we are.

1234
00:54:27,516 --> 00:54:28,016
Rami?

1235
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:29,682
AUDIENCE: Somebody
might have said this,

1236
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:33,402
but you assume all
fees are trading fees?

1237
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:34,610
ANDREW LO: Forget about fees.

1238
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,239
There are fees no
matter what you do.

1239
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,030
So for now, I'm going
to forget about fees.

1240
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,817
I'll put fees back in
later, and if I do that,

1241
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:42,650
then it's going to look
even more compelling

1242
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,870
for you to want to invest in
mutual fund M, versus n stocks.

1243
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,700
I don't know how many of you
have traded individual stocks,

1244
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,620
but if you ever try to manage
a portfolio of 1,000 stocks,

1245
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,092
it's actually fairly
time consuming, right?

1246
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:00,300
And by the way, there are
more than 1,000 securities.

1247
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,890
I mean the S&P 500 you
can think of as being M,

1248
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,360
but that's an
approximation, right?

1249
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,480
There's probably 7,000 or 8,000
securities that trade today.

1250
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,910
Probably only 2,000 or
3,000 that you would really

1251
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,520
take seriously, and
probably only 1,500

1252
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,530
that you really need from a
diversification perspective.

1253
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,676
1,500 stocks.

1254
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:19,550
Would you want to trade
in that, or would you

1255
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,838
want to trade in
one mutual fund?

1256
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:22,338
Yeah?

1257
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:26,024
AUDIENCE: Can I ask, I mean
knowing that with M you're

1258
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:30,340
trying to get on that
tangent portfolio?

1259
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,232
And you said, for
example, Warren Buffet

1260
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:33,232
beats it the whole time.

1261
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:35,549
Why don't you just buy one
share of Berkshire Hathaway,

1262
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:37,090
and you'd have a
higher Sharpe ratio?

1263
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,740
ANDREW LO: Because Warren
Buffett beat it in the past,

1264
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,786
do you think he's going
to beat it in the future?

1265
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:42,160
AUDIENCE: I would
[INAUDIBLE] it.

1266
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
ANDREW LO: I don't know.

1267
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,960
That's right.

1268
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,181
Good question, good question.

1269
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,680
I mean, if you're thinking about
Warren Buffett as a 10 year

1270
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,190
investment, I think
I might short that.

1271
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,140
I mean, you know,
he seems healthy,

1272
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,950
but you know those Cherry
Cokes have to have an impact.

1273
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,340
I'm sorry.

1274
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,180
You know, you eat enough steaks
at that Omaha restaurant,

1275
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,250
I don't know what it is,
and those Cherry Cokes,

1276
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,250
I don't know.

1277
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:06,824
OK, so fine.

1278
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:08,990
Let's not do Warren Buffett,
let's do somebody else.

1279
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,490
Fine.

1280
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,435
You tell me who that is?

1281
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,060
Tell me who the next
Warren Buffett is?

1282
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,770
Can anybody tell me?

1283
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,260
I'll be happy to do that, I'll
be happy to invest in them.

1284
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,397
Who is it?

1285
00:56:18,397 --> 00:56:21,260
AUDIENCE: Andrew Lo.

1286
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,550
ANDREW LO: Thank you, but
those who can't do teach,

1287
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,130
those who can't
teach, teach gym.

1288
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,600
And at least I don't teach gym.

1289
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,504
The point is that we don't
know who the next Warren

1290
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:35,170
Buffett is going to
be, and I don't want

1291
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,130
to have to figure that out.

1292
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,546
I mean, that's a
pretty tall order

1293
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:39,910
to tell an investor that
they've got to figure out who

1294
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,410
the next investment genius is.

1295
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,140
If they knew, they wouldn't
have to ask them to invest.

1296
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,210
They'd invest themselves, right?

1297
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,540
So what I'm showing you is
a simple way of investing

1298
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,389
that may not be as
good as Warren Buffett,

1299
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:52,930
but it's certainly
better than trying

1300
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,160
to pick the next
Warren Buffett if you

1301
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,060
don't know what you're doing.

1302
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,745
Jen?

1303
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,357
AUDIENCE: Is it easier
to kind of figure

1304
00:56:58,357 --> 00:57:01,682
out the future covariances
of the different than it

1305
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:03,774
is to pick the
next Warren Buffet?

1306
00:57:03,774 --> 00:57:06,190
ANDREW LO: Thank you, that's
another way of looking at it.

1307
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,140
If you ask the question,
is it easier to try--

1308
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,650
is the historical
covariances and variances

1309
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,920
and expected returns more
predictive of the future

1310
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,320
than your ability to find
the next Warren Buffett,

1311
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,030
then yes, that's
another good argument.

1312
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,488
That in other words,
this framework

1313
00:57:23,488 --> 00:57:29,340
relies on less
ability to forecast.

1314
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,130
It doesn't completely rule
it out because, as I said,

1315
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,184
these parameters,
they change over time.

1316
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,850
And you have to think
about that impact.

1317
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,700
So it's not totally
trivial, but from

1318
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,210
the theoretical
perspective, it seems

1319
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,490
like it's a very internally
consistent approach.

1320
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,160
Now, let me go on
for a little while

1321
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,389
longer because if it
were just this, then

1322
00:57:50,389 --> 00:57:52,180
this would be an
interesting rule of thumb.

1323
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,920
But this is not a theory of
financial markets just yet.

1324
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,130
I haven't really done
anything truly astounding

1325
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,400
because you're still left
with the question of,

1326
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,770
what's the appropriate
risk-reward trade-off?

1327
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:07,650
What should I use
for my discount rate?

1328
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,319
A lot of financial
decision making

1329
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,610
is not just picking stocks
and making good investments.

1330
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:14,640
But it's whether or not should
I invest in nanotechnology

1331
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,780
as a corporate officer of
a particular tech company,

1332
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,130
or should I invest in
green technologies?

1333
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,707
What discount rate should I use?

1334
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,290
How should I engage in capital
budgeting or project financing?

1335
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,050
All of these questions
seem like they have nothing

1336
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,009
to do with investments.

1337
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,299
So I don't want to make this
course into an investments

1338
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:31,877
course.

1339
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:33,960
There's a lot about corporate
financial management

1340
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,160
that relies on being able
to understand these markets.

1341
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,080
So let me show you
where we go next,

1342
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,340
because we're very close
now to the big payoff.

1343
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,320
We've already identified
the tangency portfolio

1344
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,490
as being special.

1345
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,450
I'm going to call
that portfolio M,

1346
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,200
and I'm going to argue that
everybody in their right minds

1347
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,560
are going to be indifferent
between picking among these two

1348
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,960
investment opportunities,
T-Bills and M,

1349
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,340
versus the n plus 1 investment
opportunities of all stocks,

1350
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,800
plus T-Bills.

1351
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,170
It turns out that
portfolio M, therefore,

1352
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,290
has to be a very
specific portfolio.

1353
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,510
And it turns out
that that portfolio

1354
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:28,080
is the portfolio of all
assets in the entire economy,

1355
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,990
in proportion to their
market capitalizations.

1356
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,140
Now what I just said is
an incredibly deep result,

1357
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,010
so I don't expect
you to just get it.

1358
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,000
Let me say it again.

1359
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,170
First of all, I want
you to understand it,

1360
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,628
and then I'm going to try to
give you the intuition for it.

1361
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:51,130
If it's true that everybody,
not only in this room,

1362
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:55,520
but in the world, if
everybody in the world

1363
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,110
is indifferent between investing
in those n plus 1 securities,

1364
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:09,350
and in two, then we can argue
that those two securities

1365
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,630
play a very special role.

1366
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:18,100
In particular, think about what
that mutual fund M has to be.

1367
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,670
Everybody in the
world wants to hold M.

1368
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,344
So, let's make the leap of faith
that everybody does hold M. So

1369
01:00:27,344 --> 01:00:29,510
in other words, now we're
in a world where everybody

1370
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:33,290
is already mean
variance optimizers,

1371
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:39,350
and they already hold two
assets in their portfolio.

1372
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:44,440
The treasury bill asset, and the
mutual fund M. So you hold M,

1373
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,100
you hold M, you hold M,
you hold M, you hold M,

1374
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,490
everybody holds M. We hold
different amounts of it,

1375
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,680
so as a hedge fund
manager, you're

1376
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,170
holding a large amount
of M. In fact, you're

1377
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,350
holding twice as much M
as your wealth allows,

1378
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,582
and you're borrowing
T-Bills to do so.

1379
01:01:01,582 --> 01:01:03,040
Somebody who's very
conservative is

1380
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,140
holding a very tiny
little bit of M.

1381
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,770
Mostly, that person is
invested in T-Bills.

1382
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,410
But the point is that every
single person's portfolio

1383
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,630
you look at, when you
look at their portfolio,

1384
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:20,940
it's M. If that's true, if
what I just said is true,

1385
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,610
what portfolio
does M have to be?

1386
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,670
There's only one that
it can possibly be.

1387
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:31,960
And that is the
portfolio of all equities

1388
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,530
in the marketplace, held in
proportion to their market

1389
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,410
value.

1390
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,570
Do you see the beauty of that?

1391
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,520
Now, let me try to explain it.

1392
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,220
I hope you understand
it, let me explain it.

1393
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,050
Why does that have to be?

1394
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,970
This has to do with
supply equaling demand.

1395
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,460
Now, I'm going to make an
argument about equilibrium.

1396
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,369
I haven't done so up until now.

1397
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:54,910
Up until now, I
haven't said anything

1398
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:59,540
about supply equaling demand,
but I'm about to do so.

1399
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,250
If everybody is holding
this portfolio M,

1400
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,990
that's the demand side, right?

1401
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:10,810
Everybody is demanding
M. On the supply side,

1402
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:16,460
I'm assuming that all stocks
that are being supplied

1403
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,780
are held.

1404
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,410
If all stocks that are being
supplied are held by somebody,

1405
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:27,490
but if everybody in the world
is holding the same portfolio

1406
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,044
M, when you aggregate
all of the demands.

1407
01:02:31,044 --> 01:02:33,210
So I'm going to add up your
demand, and your demand,

1408
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:33,940
and your demand, and you're.

1409
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,910
We're going to go
through the class,

1410
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,451
and go through the
world, we're going

1411
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,070
to add up everybody's demand.

1412
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:43,690
In every single case, your
weights are identical.

1413
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,400
You're holding the
same portfolio M.

1414
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,200
So when I aggregate
the entire world,

1415
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,900
and I get the portfolio M,
what does it have to equal?

1416
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,740
It can only equal the sum total
of all assets in the world,

1417
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,370
right?

1418
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:01,800
Supply equals demand.

1419
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,120
And therefore, when I aggregate
all of your holdings of M

1420
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,780
into one big fat
M, that big fat M

1421
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,700
can only be equal to
one thing, which is

1422
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,530
all the equities in the world.

1423
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:18,231
And the weightings are just
simply their market caps,

1424
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:18,730
right?

1425
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,740
There's only so much
of General Motors.

1426
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,640
Take the entire
sum total of that,

1427
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,690
that's the global investment
in General Motors.

1428
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,670
And then you do that
for every single stock,

1429
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:33,260
and you divide that by the total
market capital of all stocks,

1430
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:37,240
you get the market portfolio, M.

1431
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:43,680
So this shockingly, simple,
but extraordinarily powerful

1432
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,670
result is due to Bill Sharpe.

1433
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:50,310
Harry Markowitz came up
with portfolio optimization.

1434
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,380
He applied mean
variance analysis

1435
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,094
to portfolio optimization
and argued that everybody

1436
01:03:55,094 --> 01:03:56,010
has to be on the line.

1437
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,030
Bill Sharpe looked at
this and said, aha.

1438
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,619
If everybody's on
that line, that

1439
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,660
means that everybody's
going to be either holding

1440
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,050
M or T-Bills, or
both, and therefore,

1441
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,260
the only thing that
M could possibly be

1442
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,680
is the market portfolio.

1443
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,620
And now we have a proxy for the
market portfolio, the Russell

1444
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,700
2000.

1445
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,320
Or the S&P 500.

1446
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,944
Both of those are very well
diversified stock that have

1447
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:21,610
lot-- they don't have
everything in it--

1448
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:24,950
but they have a lot of things in
it, that proxy for everything.

1449
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:29,770
The Russell 2000 has 2,000
stocks weighted by market cap.

1450
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:33,310
That's as close as you're going
to get to everything that you

1451
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,712
care about.

1452
01:04:35,712 --> 01:04:37,920
So now, you'll see we're
benchmarking is coming from,

1453
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,290
but I'm going to get back
to that in more detail.

1454
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:47,380
So this equilibrium result
that says supply equals demand,

1455
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,030
identifies this portfolio
M. And what it says

1456
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:56,590
is that if everybody does this,
if everybody takes finance

1457
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,980
here and learns how
to do this, it's

1458
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,810
not going to kill the idea.

1459
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,320
It's going to lead to a
very well-defined portfolio

1460
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,445
M. Now, let me take
it one step farther,

1461
01:05:09,445 --> 01:05:13,830
then I want to ask
you to ask questions.

1462
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,940
If I know what that
portfolio M is,

1463
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,945
then I've got an
equation for this line.

1464
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,040
I can write down a relationship
between the expected return

1465
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,280
and risk of a
portfolio on this line.

1466
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,190
And this is it.

1467
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,700
The expected rate of return
of an efficient portfolio,

1468
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,640
by efficient I mean a
portfolio that's on that line.

1469
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,100
Anything that's not on that
line, if it's below that line,

1470
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,470
it's inefficient, right?

1471
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,870
You're not getting as much
expected return per unit risk,

1472
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,780
and you're not reducing your
risk as much as you can,

1473
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,880
per unit of expected return.

1474
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,430
The expected return of
an efficient portfolio

1475
01:05:55,430 --> 01:06:01,710
is equal to the risk-free
rate, plus the ratio

1476
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,610
of the standard deviation
of that portfolio, divided

1477
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:09,180
by the standard deviation
of the tangency portfolio,

1478
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:15,120
or the market, multiplied by
the excess return of the market

1479
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:15,780
portfolio.

1480
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:28,340
This result is a risk-reward
trade-off between risk

1481
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,610
and expected return.

1482
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:34,090
You see, what it says is really
something quite astounding.

1483
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,060
It's telling you that,
here's the risk-free rate.

1484
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,630
That's the base return
for your portfolio.

1485
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,520
And what this is
telling you is that what

1486
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,610
you should expect
for your portfolio

1487
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:50,650
is that base return,
plus something extra.

1488
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:55,800
And the extra is the
market's excess return,

1489
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,650
multiplied by a factor.

1490
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,930
And the factor is simply
how risky your portfolio

1491
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,990
is relative to the market.

1492
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,290
Let's do a simple example.

1493
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:09,960
Suppose that your portfolio
is the exact same risk

1494
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,912
as the market.

1495
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:13,370
Well, if that's
the case, then what

1496
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,216
is your expected rate of return?

1497
01:07:15,216 --> 01:07:16,150
AUDIENCE: The market.

1498
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,274
ANDREW LO: It's the market.

1499
01:07:17,274 --> 01:07:21,750
So it's the risk-free rate,
plus the market excess return,

1500
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,122
which, when you add it
together, is just the market.

1501
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:25,830
Suppose you're holding
a portfolio that's

1502
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:29,040
more risky than the market.

1503
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,900
Is your rate of
return greater or less

1504
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,070
than the rate of
return of the market?

1505
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,760
AUDIENCE: Greater.

1506
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,551
ANDREW LO: Greater.

1507
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:36,570
Suppose that your
portfolio has no risk.

1508
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,476
Suppose that sigma p is 0, then
what's your rate of return?

1509
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:40,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1510
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,310
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

1511
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,270
Makes sense, right?

1512
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,370
This is very intuitive.

1513
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:48,000
What this tells us, now,
is that we can figure out

1514
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,170
what the fair rate of return
is for an efficient portfolio.

1515
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,420
For any portfolio
on this line, I

1516
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,400
can tell you what my
fair rate of return is,

1517
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,620
and it's an objective measure.

1518
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,060
It's not just theory now.

1519
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,551
Now, I can go into
the marketplace,

1520
01:08:01,551 --> 01:08:03,550
I can measure the expected
return of the market.

1521
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,050
You know what that
is, historically?

1522
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,945
Not including the
last few months.

1523
01:08:06,945 --> 01:08:08,126
AUDIENCE: 7%.

1524
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,750
ANDREW LO: It's about
7%, historically.

1525
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,180
Over the last 100
years, 7%, the expected

1526
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,730
rate of return of the market.

1527
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,316
Sorry, the expected
risk premium,

1528
01:08:16,316 --> 01:08:17,399
the excess rate of return.

1529
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,414
About 7%.

1530
01:08:18,414 --> 01:08:20,080
What about the
volatility of the market?

1531
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,229
It's been about
15% historically.

1532
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:24,899
So according to
this relationship,

1533
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:26,910
I've already figured
out what this number is.

1534
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,036
It's like 7%.

1535
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:29,910
I've already figured
out what this number is.

1536
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:31,410
It's like 15%.

1537
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:34,890
So now, you should be able
to get a benchmark for what

1538
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:38,670
to expect when you've got
a particular level of risk

1539
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,069
in an efficient portfolio.

1540
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:42,510
You've got all the ingredients.

1541
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:43,593
What about risk-free rate?

1542
01:08:43,593 --> 01:08:45,450
Well, it depends on
what risk-free rate,

1543
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,460
but let's talk about
over a one year period.

1544
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,960
Right now we're
looking at somewhere

1545
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,109
between, I don't
know, 1%, 2%, 3%,

1546
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:55,290
depending on what day of
the week you're looking at.

1547
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,938
So one year T-Bill rate
is about 1% or so, yeah?

1548
01:08:58,938 --> 01:09:00,688
AUDIENCE: I think it
was the last class we

1549
01:09:00,688 --> 01:09:02,064
talked about unsystematic risk.

1550
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:02,689
ANDREW LO: Yes.

1551
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:06,870
AUDIENCE: Is that defined
by [INAUDIBLE] in this case?

1552
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,580
ANDREW LO: No, the
unsystematic risk

1553
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,890
is risk that is not
measured by sigma p,

1554
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,960
so we're going to
come back to that.

1555
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,729
Let me hold off on
that for now, because I

1556
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:16,930
want to come back to it after
I finish developing this.

1557
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:18,626
There's going to be
a connection between

1558
01:09:18,626 --> 01:09:20,250
systematic and
unsystematic risk that's

1559
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,990
going to come right out
of this relationship.

1560
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:23,490
Yeah, Brian?

1561
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:28,310
AUDIENCE: So if you take
the S&P 500 as M here,

1562
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:31,640
the market portfolio, and the
capitalization is the weight,

1563
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,855
so you've got non-zero weights
for all the different stocks

1564
01:09:34,855 --> 01:09:35,430
there.

1565
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,760
Does that imply that there's
no stocks in the S&P 500

1566
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,160
that are Southeast
of any others?

1567
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,819
ANDREW LO: No, no,
there could be.

1568
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:43,630
AUDIENCE: Why would
you have them,

1569
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,671
because we said those are
strictly non-preferred?

1570
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:47,910
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
if you're looking

1571
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,800
at a pairwise comparison.

1572
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,200
If, now, you're trying to
create an entire collection

1573
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,850
of these portfolios
of securities,

1574
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,129
that's a different story.

1575
01:09:55,129 --> 01:09:57,420
That's why I answered in
response to Justin's question.

1576
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,850
Justin said, why not
just trade off those two?

1577
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,380
Why not?

1578
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,090
It's because you can do far
better by using all of them

1579
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,290
in this way.

1580
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,200
You see, by looking at pairwise,
you can no doubt do better.

1581
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,644
But if I use all of them,
I get this entire line.

1582
01:10:10,644 --> 01:10:12,060
And you can't get
that entire line

1583
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,780
just from looking at
two of these stocks,

1584
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,580
you need all of them.

1585
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,250
AUDIENCE: So in this
portfolio of three,

1586
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,520
if you kick GM over to
the right a little bit,

1587
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,530
and made it strictly
non-preferred to IBM,

1588
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:24,280
then you still might
have a positive portfolio

1589
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,560
weight on GM?

1590
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,360
ANDREW LO: You might,
but more likely,

1591
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,917
it'll be a negative
portfolio weight.

1592
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:30,750
It'll be negative, and
you'll be shorting it

1593
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,750
somewhere along the line here.

1594
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,930
However, the tangency
portfolio, by assumption,

1595
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:41,490
if it's the market portfolio,
cannot have negative weights.

1596
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:45,570
And so there, what will happen,
is that all of the stocks

1597
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,580
will change in
their relationship

1598
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,230
based upon various different
kinds of equilibrium,

1599
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:52,440
so that you won't get into
a lot of those situations

1600
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,300
where you're going to be
shorting these negative stocks.

1601
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:55,800
Yeah?

1602
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,132
AUDIENCE: So basically,
according to the Sharpe theory,

1603
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:04,380
every stock that the
market, the capital is not 0

1604
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,500
is worth holding
in some portfolio?

1605
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1606
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,030
AUDIENCE: Diversifying
your portfolio.

1607
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,030
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1608
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:12,990
Every stock has some
benefit in adding

1609
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,570
to this particular
risk-reward trade-off,

1610
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:19,660
and the sum total benefit
is summarized by this line.

1611
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,910
That's the ultimate objective.

1612
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,390
AUDIENCE: If I don't hold a
specific stock in the market

1613
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:26,502
and I gain a
diversification [INAUDIBLE]?

1614
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:27,210
ANDREW LO: Sorry?

1615
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,864
If you hold a specific stock?

1616
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:31,530
AUDIENCE: If I don't
hold it, because it

1617
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,510
has market [INAUDIBLE].

1618
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,370
ANDREW LO: Oh, if
you put 0 weight.

1619
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,640
Yes.

1620
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,730
What Sharpe would argue,
based upon this theory,

1621
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:41,190
is that you want to
hold as many stocks

1622
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:43,770
as you can to get the
most diversification.

1623
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,210
Now, that's the theory.

1624
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:49,410
In practice, it may well
be that the benefits do not

1625
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,960
outweigh the costs, because
when you hold multiple stocks,

1626
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,900
you have to manage them,
and so it may cost more.

1627
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,330
So a mutual fund
that has 3,000 stocks

1628
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:01,080
may have a higher expense ratio
than a mutual fund with 500.

1629
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,800
It may not.

1630
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,500
Nowadays, actually, the
technology is so good that

1631
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,580
probably it doesn't.

1632
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,250
But 15 years ago,
that was not true.

1633
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,140
But apart from the
transactions cost,

1634
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,420
the theory suggests
more is better.

1635
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,124
Because it will always give
you more opportunities, and it

1636
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,540
can never hurt you because you
could always put a 0 weight

1637
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,831
on them if you don't like them.

1638
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:30,040
Now, it turns out that this is
a trade-off between the expected

1639
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:35,820
return of an
efficient portfolio,

1640
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,860
and the risk of that portfolio.

1641
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,460
In other words,
this applies only

1642
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,100
to portfolios on
that tangency line.

1643
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,040
What if you want to know what
the expected rate of return

1644
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,120
is for Wal-Mart?

1645
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,510
We just said that
no individual stock

1646
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:58,170
is going to be likely to be
on that efficient frontier.

1647
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,690
And therefore, no
individual stock

1648
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,016
is likely to be on this line.

1649
01:13:03,016 --> 01:13:04,890
So this is great if what
you're talking about

1650
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,230
is investing in
efficient portfolios,

1651
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,500
but how does that help the
corporate financial officer

1652
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,041
that's trying to
figure out how to do

1653
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,650
capital budgeting for a
particular pharmaceutical

1654
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,399
project?

1655
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:16,440
It turns out, it doesn't.

1656
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,106
It doesn't help.

1657
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:19,770
This doesn't answer
that question.

1658
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:24,630
It turns out, you need to have
an additional piece of theory

1659
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,590
that allows you to derive
the same results, not

1660
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:33,370
just for the efficient
portfolios here,

1661
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:35,590
but for any portfolio.

1662
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,780
And this is another
innovation of Bill Sharpe.

1663
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,190
This is actually why Bill
Sharpe won the Nobel Prize.

1664
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,250
It was not for this
little picture here,

1665
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,310
but it was for this
equation right here.

1666
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:50,110
What Bill Sharpe discovered is
after computing the equilibrium

1667
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,810
relationships among various
different securities,

1668
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:58,670
he's demonstrated that there
has to be a linear relationship

1669
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:05,230
between any stock's expected
return and the market risk

1670
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,550
premium.

1671
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:09,370
Just like here, where you've
got the risk-free rate,

1672
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,800
plus some extra premium.

1673
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,620
So this is the premium,
the second term.

1674
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,790
But what Bill Sharpe showed was
that if this portfolio is not

1675
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:24,120
an efficient portfolio,
if it's not on that line,

1676
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,810
the linear relationship
still holds.

1677
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:31,080
But it turns out that this
particular multiplier is

1678
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,210
no longer the right one to use.

1679
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:39,300
It turns out that the right
parameter to plug in there,

1680
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,240
is something called beta.

1681
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,440
Now, you've heard all
about beta, I'm sure.

1682
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,500
But now, I'm telling you
exactly what beta is.

1683
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,010
Beta is the multiplier
that is defined

1684
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,640
by the covariance between
the return on the market

1685
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,760
and the return on the
individual asset, divided

1686
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,220
by the variance of
that market return.

1687
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:08,780
If the portfolio happens to
be on that efficient frontier,

1688
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:13,040
then this beta reduces
to this previous measure.

1689
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:17,090
So this is a special case of
the more general relationship

1690
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,560
where beta is used
as the multiplier.

1691
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,960
So let me repeat what beta is.

1692
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,250
Beta is the ratio of the
covariance between the return

1693
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,860
on the particular asset or
portfolio, that may or may not

1694
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:33,350
be efficient, it's any
asset, with the return

1695
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,980
on the market portfolio.

1696
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,710
So this numerator is a
measure of the covariability

1697
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,200
between the particular
asset that you're

1698
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,410
trying to measure the
expected return of,

1699
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:48,890
and that tangency
portfolio, divided

1700
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:53,390
by the variance of that
tangency portfolio.

1701
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:00,960
Beta, it turns out, is
the right measure of risk,

1702
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,190
in the sense that it is the
beta that determines what

1703
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:09,480
the multiplier is going to be on
the market risk premium, which

1704
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,290
is to be added to your asset's
expected rate of return,

1705
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,810
above and beyond
the risk-free rate.

1706
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,920
That's how the cost of capital
is determined for your asset.

1707
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,420
So I think you all saw
how I derived this,

1708
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,070
but I didn't derive this.

1709
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,600
I'm just telling
you this is really

1710
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:35,700
where Sharpe's ideas became
extraordinarily compelling.

1711
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,800
And in order to
understand how to derive

1712
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,017
that, I'm going to refer
you to 433, because

1713
01:16:41,017 --> 01:16:42,600
in that investment's
course, we really

1714
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,082
delve into the underpinnings
of that kind of calculation.

1715
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:47,540
It's a little bit
more involved, it

1716
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,470
involves some matrix algebra.

1717
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:52,502
But it's not terribly
difficult or challenging,

1718
01:16:52,502 --> 01:16:54,960
and certainly be happy to give
you references if any of you

1719
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,710
are interested.

1720
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:59,370
I believe it's in
Brealey, Myers, and Allen.

1721
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,380
But the bottom line
is that this gives you

1722
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,490
an extraordinarily
important conclusion now

1723
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:09,930
to the several weeks that we've
been working towards this goal.

1724
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:14,100
Which is now, finally,
after eight or nine weeks,

1725
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:17,850
I can tell you how to come up
with the appropriate discount

1726
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:21,120
rate for various
NPV calculations.

1727
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,640
The answer is the
expected rate of return,

1728
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,940
the appropriate
fair rate of return,

1729
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:30,300
or the market equilibrium
rate of return,

1730
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,960
is simply given by the beta
of that security, multiplied

1731
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,140
by the expected excess return
on the market portfolio.

1732
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,729
So now, this has a lot
of assumptions, granted.

1733
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:43,520
We're going to talk
about those assumptions

1734
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,430
over the next
couple of lectures.

1735
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:50,740
But what we've done today
is move the theory forward

1736
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:55,030
by quite a bit, because we've
identified a particular method

1737
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:58,150
for coming up with the
appropriate cost of capital

1738
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,440
as a function of the risk.

1739
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,340
Where the risk is measured,
not by volatility anymore,

1740
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:09,710
but by the covariance between an
asset and the market portfolio.

1741
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,960
And next time, I'm
going to try to give you

1742
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,300
some intuition for
why this should be,

1743
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:20,120
why this makes sense, and why,
in a mean variance efficient

1744
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,840
set of portfolios, why it
reduces to something that we

1745
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,650
know and love.

1746
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,670
Any questions?

1747
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,170
OK.

1748
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,010
I'll stop here, and I'll
see you on Wednesday.
