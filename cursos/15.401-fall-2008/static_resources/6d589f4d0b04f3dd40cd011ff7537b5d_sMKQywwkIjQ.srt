8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,650
ANDREW LO: In today's
lecture, I want

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,300
to continue where we
were last time in talking

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,310
about applications of the
net present value rule

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,210
to capital budgeting
and project financing.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,370
As promised, today
what I'm going to do

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,750
is to talk specifically
about other alternatives

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,550
to net present value
that are not recommended,

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,740
but which you need
to know about simply

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,790
because they actually are used
in practice to some degree.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,880
And you have to be an
intelligent consumer

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,709
of all of these
different ideas so

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,120
that you can pick and choose.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,740
And actually, there
are some instances

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,780
where these other
alternatives can

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,050
shed some light on
the particular problem

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,030
and challenges at hand.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,120
I'll try to describe
those as we go over them.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,000
Before I do, a student
came up and asked me

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
about a concept called
adjusted present value.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,700
I wanted just to
make a note of that

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,670
because, so far, we've
been talking about NPV.

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,400
But in fact, both the textbook,
as well as the best practices,

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,380
would suggest that
you use something

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,020
called adjusted present value.

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,910
Which basically
makes adjustments

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,480
for things like taxes,
project interactions,

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,880
strategic alternatives,
optionality, and so on.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,400
I want to recommend that you
first of all, keep in mind

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,490
this notion of
adjusted present value.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,030
That's what you'll be learning
about in 402, and in more

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,310
advanced courses on capital
budgeting and project

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,340
financing.

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,670
So for now, NPV is
the right answer,

41
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,270
but when you learn more about
how to make those adjustments,

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,750
you're going to
want to use them,

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,780
and then we call the particular
criterion APV instead of NPF.

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,479
Just terminology that
you should be aware of.

45
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,520
All right, so what I want
to do today, as I said,

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,560
is to talk about three other
approaches to capital budgeting

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,190
that various professionals
have used in the past,

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,740
and which some are used to
a great extent even today.

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,570
And they are payback period and
the discounted version of that

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,300
called discounted payback.

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,110
Second is the IRR,
Internal Rate of Return,

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,370
and the third is the
profitability index.

53
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,800
Each of these have its
own particular uses,

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,590
and I'm going to try to describe
them to you very briefly.

55
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,530
And then we're going to talk
about different applications.

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,050
The bottom line, just
to be sure that there's

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,240
no misunderstanding, NPV is
always the right thing to do.

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,190
So that's what we're
recommending for any capital

59
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,300
budgeting application.

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,630
However, you should
still understand

61
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,610
what these three other
alternatives are so

62
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,010
that you can speak about
them intelligently, talk

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,020
about their advantages,
and disadvantages.

64
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,600
All right, so let's get started.

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,980
Payback period-- oh, question.

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,130
Yeah?

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,558
AUDIENCE: Is this
for [INAUDIBLE]?

68
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:34,075
I mean you speak pretty
firmly about NPV being better.

69
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:34,700
ANDREW LO: Yes.

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,370
So is it people using those
other methods are wrong,

71
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,600
or less intelligent, or is there
anyway to kindly describe that?

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,689
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, why are they

73
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,980
using these other alternatives?

74
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,930
Let me get to that later, OK?

75
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,420
I mean, one could argue that
they're less intelligent.

76
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,490
Not everybody is
able to get into MIT

77
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,490
and take this wonderful course.

78
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,910
So by definition,
they're less intelligent.

79
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,350
But no, I don't want to make
such a blanket statement.

80
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,840
I think that,
partly, you'll find

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,880
that these other
techniques have been

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,709
used in practice both
because of cultural inertia.

83
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,200
They were the first to
have come on the scene

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,630
before NOV was fully worked out.

85
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,039
So people are just used
to doing things the way

86
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,080
they're used to doing it.

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,970
People don't like
change, necessarily,

88
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,520
when it's particularly
forced upon them.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,200
But the second reason is that
these other methods capture

90
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,560
other aspects of risk
that, in certain cases,

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,950
may actually be more important
for the particular individual

92
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,730
decision makers.

93
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,635
For example, we've
talked about a lot

94
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:44,760
of different kinds of risk.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,030
Market risk, estimation
risk, credit risk.

96
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,580
But what's the most
important risk to all of you

97
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,120
once you start
working in your jobs?

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

99
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:56,661
ANDREW LO: What?

100
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:57,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

101
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,371
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

102
00:04:58,371 --> 00:04:59,410
Career risk.

103
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,310
Career risk is probably
the most important risk

104
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,400
from the typical perspective
of the decision maker.

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
And frankly, some
of these measures

106
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,010
that I'm about to describe
focus on career risk

107
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,590
more than they do on the
risk to the investor,

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,940
or the shareholder.

109
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,450
What I'd like you all to
focus on in doing your jobs

110
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,540
is to try to maximize
the value of the company

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,700
from the perspective of
the owners of the company.

112
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,010
You are agents of the
owners, so therefore, you

113
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,070
want to maximize the
value to the shareholders.

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,460
But in fact, the
way people behave

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,180
is often somewhat different.

116
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,850
So we'll talk about
that as we describe

117
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,230
each of these measures.

118
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,720
In fact, let's talk about
the first measure as a way

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,460
to illustrate the point
about career risk.

120
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,550
Payback period is a
very simple concept.

121
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,030
It is simply the
minimum number of years

122
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,420
that it requires for a
particular investment

123
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,800
to pay back.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,024
So if you invest a million
dollars in a project,

125
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:02,440
and it's going to generate
some revenues, the question is,

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,440
how long is it going to take
before the project earns

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,400
a million dollars?

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,820
Namely, it pays back
the original investment.

129
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,620
So the definition,
here, is simple.

130
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,490
If you assume that
cf1 through cfk

131
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,740
are the cash flows
to the project,

132
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,590
and you invest a
certain amount of cash,

133
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,010
cf0, initially, then the
question is, how long a period

134
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,360
do you need so that the sum
of the future cash flows

135
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,140
exceeds the initial investment?

136
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,670
What's the minimum number of
periods for that to happen?

137
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,470
And that minimum, k, is
called the payback period.

138
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,250
Now, right away you
see that there's

139
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,200
a problem because
we're adding cash

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
flows in different periods.

141
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,050
So I hope by now, when you look
at an expression like that,

142
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,970
it causes you great
cognitive dissonance and pain

143
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,020
to look at that.

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,730
It's like adding pounds to yen.

145
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,950
Remember we did that the
first day of class, right?

146
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,190
Three pounds plus
25 yen is what?

147
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,150
I don't know.

148
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,100
So when you're adding
these cash flows,

149
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,670
it doesn't make sense because
you're adding different units.

150
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,170
But let's forget
about that for now.

151
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,795
Let's just look at
the equation and try

152
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,460
to divine what we mean from it.

153
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,160
For independent
projects, a criterion

154
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,280
that you might
construct using payback

155
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,800
is to accept the project
if k is less than

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,160
or equal to some pre-specified
threshold, t star.

157
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,480
And for mutually
exclusive projects,

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,690
where you can only take
one, pick the project

159
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,900
that has the smallest
payback period

160
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,830
subject to that
threshold t star.

161
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,370
That's the typical
approach to using payback.

162
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,420
Clearly, this is a relatively
shortsighted approach.

163
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,500
It doesn't take into account
scale, how much money you're

164
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,650
going to make from this.

165
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,140
It doesn't take
into account risk,

166
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,000
other than the risk of
not getting paid back.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,740
So it's a very,
very narrow focus

168
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,520
in terms of what it's
trying to accomplish.

169
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,500
Now, we can try to fix this.

170
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,260
And we can fix this by
using discounted payback.

171
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,270
So now at least, the cash
flows are in the same units.

172
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,180
So you can use
discounted payback,

173
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,140
but it still ignores the cash
flows after the payback period.

174
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,740
So in particular, you
can have a project

175
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,450
that requires cash inflow
today, that then generates

176
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,150
a bunch of positive
cash flows thereafter,

177
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,179
but then after the payback
period, in some future date,

178
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,730
it generates tremendously
negative cash flows.

179
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,970
Either because of some kind
of liabilities that it incurs,

180
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,890
or some other additional
investments that it

181
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,570
requires to keep it going.

182
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,300
All of that stuff is
ignored by payback.

183
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,770
So in particular, this
can have a negative NPV,

184
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,810
but you might still
want to take it

185
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,320
because it pays
back in a relatively

186
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,940
short period of time.

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,500
That's a mistake.

188
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,390
But you can understand
how something

189
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,290
like this ended up getting
put into practice, right?

190
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,030
Career risk.

191
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,130
If you're a manager
of a division,

192
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,180
and your job when you were hired
is to turn it around and make

193
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,420
it profitable, then
it's very important

194
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,260
that you take on projects
with short payback periods.

195
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,300
But that's not necessarily
in the best interests

196
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,010
of the company, or of the
investors, or even of yourself

197
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,370
if the incentives have
been properly calibrated.

198
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,430
In other words, if, as part
of your compensation contract,

199
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,340
they say, here, you get a
bunch of stock in the company.

200
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,980
We want you to maximize the
value of the shareholders.

201
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,920
Then what you ought to be
doing is maximizing NPV.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,980
You're not supposed to be
focusing on other aspects.

203
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,220
But as a practical matter,
people look at this.

204
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,920
People want to know how
long is it going to be

205
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,810
before this thing pays back.

206
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,470
Now, I don't want to argue that
it's completely irrational.

207
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,280
Can anybody give me a rationale
for why payback is actually

208
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,770
a sensible thing to consider?

209
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,410
Yeah, David?

210
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,334
AUDIENCE: The main
thing that fueled

211
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,739
this, in an NPV
calculation, you're

212
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,670
assuming that you know
what cash flow's going

213
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,840
to be way out in the future.

214
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,350
ANDREW LO: Yeah, exactly.

215
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,379
AUDIENCE: And if
you have a big cash

216
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,003
flow way out in the
future end, there's

217
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:19,440
so little certainty your
career's attached to that--

218
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
ANDREW LO: That's right.

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,821
AUDIENCE: --you'd want to weight
effort more towards a calculus

220
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,790
and--

221
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,790
ANDREW LO: That's right.

222
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,000
So apart from the career
risk, which you mentioned,

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,220
but I want to downplay
that because I

224
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,610
want to argue that it
is possible for payback

225
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,620
to add value to shareholders.

226
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,700
Simply because there is an
implicit recognition for those

227
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,970
who use payback that it's
really hard to estimate

228
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,160
what's going to happen
in the distant future.

229
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,790
So if you've got a project
that pays back sooner rather

230
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,120
than later, that's
probably better

231
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,760
because there's less
certainty about what's

232
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,960
going to happen in the future.

233
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,150
Now there's a lot of if's
in that statement, right?

234
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,280
If really what you're
concerned about

235
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,640
is the growing uncertainty
of the project,

236
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,520
that ought to be reflected
in the discount rates.

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,630
So I'm not saying that
you should ignore it.

238
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,390
What I'm saying is that payback
is not necessarily the best

239
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,190
way of capturing it.

240
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,380
Although I think we could
acknowledge that it does

241
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,120
serve a useful
purpose in the sense

242
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,990
that it is focusing your
attention on the relatively

243
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,410
recent periods of cash flows.

244
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,210
But there may be better
ways of taking care

245
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,412
of that, if that's the issue.

246
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:34,920
A question or comment?

247
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,596
Yeah?

248
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,550
AUDIENCE: Liquidity?

249
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,216
ANDREW LO: Yeah?

250
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:40,605
AUDIENCE: If you have a project
that takes cash outflow up

251
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,331
front, and then
years and years out,

252
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:47,273
it gives you a big cash inflow.

253
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,060
From that time until the cash
outflow, you get nothing?

254
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,730
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

255
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,235
AUDIENCE: That could even
present some problems

256
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:53,880
in finance.

257
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
ANDREW LO: That's right.

258
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,930
So another aspect of payback
is this liquidity issue.

259
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,550
In other words,
projects that pay back

260
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,970
in a shorter period of
time require less liquidity

261
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,830
over longer horizons.

262
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,782
However, once again I'm going to
say, if liquidity is the issue,

263
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,740
you ought to take that
into account explicitly,

264
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,710
and understand what the term
structure of your borrowing

265
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,240
costs are over
different periods.

266
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,821
If you factor that in, then
it should already be in there.

267
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,320
If.

268
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,270
AUDIENCE: Is that closer to a
discount rate or something--

269
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,603
ANDREW LO: That's right, it can.

270
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,900
It should certainly,
because we know

271
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,290
that there is a yield curve.

272
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,890
The typical yield curve
is upward sloping.

273
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,600
Typical I say, not always.

274
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,575
But the typical yield
curve is upward sloping.

275
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,200
What that's telling
you is that there's

276
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,470
a premium for borrowing longer.

277
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,140
So that basically gets
at your liquidity issue.

278
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,870
But if you have additional
concerns above and beyond that,

279
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,910
that should be reflected
in your calculations.

280
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,950
Payback is an inefficient
way of capturing that.

281
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,060
It's a very zero-one kind
of an approach to dealing

282
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,590
with that kind of an issue.

283
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,237
Yeah?

284
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,487
AUDIENCE: Think that people
they lose the payback when

285
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:58,204
they believe that
the cash flow is

286
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,180
the same all over the period.

287
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,662
Which really makes sense.

288
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:03,649
Like in multiple.

289
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,940
ANDREW LO: So you're saying
that it doesn't make sense.

290
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,564
AUDIENCE: It makes
sense, when the cash

291
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,560
flow will be the same--

292
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,020
ANDREW LO: If the cash,
yes, that's right.

293
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,500
If the cash flow is going to
be level, then it makes sense.

294
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,780
You're right.

295
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,686
AUDIENCE: Like multiple.

296
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,519
You have a multiple for
industry, you use it

297
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,410
and you have it.

298
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,030
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

299
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,520
There are conditions
under which payback

300
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,200
can give you sensible results.

301
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,390
But think about how restrictive
those conditions are.

302
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,270
You need to have
level cash flows,

303
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,530
and moreover, you have to be
comparing projects, all of whom

304
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,620
have level cash flows and
have comparable risks.

305
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,527
If they have different risks, or
different levels of cash flows,

306
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,360
or different liquidity,
all of those things,

307
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,770
cannot be captured by payback.

308
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,800
So I don't want to
beat up too much on it.

309
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,650
This is a relatively
easy target.

310
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,230
The point is that it
provides some information,

311
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,825
and you should know what it is.

312
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,700
Regardless of whether
you're going to use it.

313
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,260
You ought to be able to
have that at your fingertips

314
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,770
so when somebody says,
and undoubtedly somebody

315
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,830
will say to you, when
you're pushing a project,

316
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,684
they're going to say,
what's the payback period.

317
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:06,850
You need to know the answer.

318
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,380
It's not good enough
for you to say,

319
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,780
my 401 professor told me
it doesn't make sense.

320
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,820
You've got to basically
have an answer,

321
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,240
and then argue that
while payback doesn't

322
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,535
summarize all of
the characteristics

323
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:19,660
that we're concerned about.

324
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,810
Second method, the
profitability index.

325
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,390
Now this one is another
easy criterion to criticize,

326
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,010
but it's so close to NPV that
the only thing that really is

327
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,510
an issue is the scale factor.

328
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,940
So let me explain.

329
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,652
Profitability index is simply
the gross present value, as

330
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,860
opposed to net present value.

331
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,380
It's the gross
present value, divided

332
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,120
by the initial investment.

333
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,030
So the present value is
simply the present value

334
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,450
of all the cash flows, divided
by the initial investment.

335
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,840
So you could think of it
as a gross rate of return.

336
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,390
In other words, 1
plus the net rate

337
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,680
of return of your
investment in this project.

338
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,260
If the profitability
index is greater than 1,

339
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,830
take the project.

340
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,550
If it's less than 1,
don't take the project.

341
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,150
And if you've got a bunch of
mutually exclusive projects,

342
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,270
pick the one that has the
highest profitability index.

343
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,980
That's the approach.

344
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,886
Now what's wrong with this?

345
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:36,280
It's not that far off from NPV.

346
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,550
In fact, you could show
that with a profitability

347
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,420
index is greater than 1, you've
got a positive NPV project.

348
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,880
When the profitability
index is less than 1,

349
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,450
you've got a
negative NPV project.

350
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,640
So in terms of taking
or not taking a project,

351
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,479
it's actually the same as NPV.

352
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,417
[INAUDIBLE]?

353
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,996
AUDIENCE: The thing it doesn't
tell you is how much they

354
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:59,290
usually must have [INAUDIBLE].

355
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,486
It can be $1 or $1 billion.

356
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:02,860
ANDREW LO: That's
right, exactly.

357
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,651
There's nothing that
tells you about scale.

358
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:09,990
So, if you guys give me
$1 and I give you back $2,

359
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,300
that's going to have a
profitability index of 2.

360
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,870
Which is going to look
really good relative

361
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,690
to an investment in
Berkshire Hathaway

362
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,220
20 years ago, because that
may not have given you

363
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,170
the same profitability index.

364
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,090
But Warren Buffett has
made a lot more money

365
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,710
than just a dollar.

366
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,930
So, this ignores
scale and that's

367
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,210
obviously something
that you can't

368
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,350
afford to do when you've got
mutually exclusive projects

369
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,589
where you're ranking them.

370
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,130
You don't want to pick the one
with the highest profitability

371
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,629
index.

372
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,680
What you want to do is
to pick the one that

373
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,470
is generating the
most value for you,

374
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,480
in terms of dollars and cents.

375
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,190
In other words, NPV.

376
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,825
So once again, NPV, although
is very close to this,

377
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,700
is actually preferred
because you're actually

378
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,700
getting a hard amount of dollars
and cents as the bottom line.

379
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,420
Any questions about
profitability index?

380
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,688
Yes?

381
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:10,108
AUDIENCE: A lot of time,
the money that you have

382
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:13,788
in hand investment is limited.

383
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:18,280
[INAUDIBLE] play into a role
like when you have projects.

384
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,130
ANDREW LO: Well, it
does play a role.

385
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,119
So the question is, if you
have a limited amount of money

386
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,700
to invest, does
that play a role?

387
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,650
It absolutely does
play a role, but it

388
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,420
plays a role that is contrary
to what the profitability

389
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,310
index wants to do for you.

390
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,960
The profitability
index is simply

391
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,410
telling you whether something
is a positive or negative NPV.

392
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,219
It's not telling
you how much NPV

393
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,010
you're going to get
for the amount of money

394
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,750
you're going to invest.

395
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,260
So what you need to do is
to focus on the latter.

396
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,390
In other words, how
much cash are you

397
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,450
going to be able to generate
from a particular project?

398
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,970
$50, or $50 million?

399
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,810
That really makes
a big difference.

400
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,740
Particularly, if what you have
is a limited amount of cash,

401
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,760
scale is actually an
important concept to you.

402
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,310
The reason that economists
and financial economists,

403
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,030
by extension, focus
on rates of return?

404
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,900
Did that ever strike
you as being rather odd?

405
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,120
In other words, when you
talk to business people,

406
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
very often they'll speak
in terms of dollar amounts.

407
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,730
Like, a startup
costs $15 million,

408
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,320
or the profits for last quarter
was a million and a half

409
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,850
dollars.

410
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,190
They won't talk always
in rates of return.

411
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,070
Whereas economists, particularly
financial economists,

412
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,114
they express everything
in rates of return.

413
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,030
I mean, that's what we've
done in this course.

414
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,920
We've spent most of our time
focusing on r, not on v. v

415
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
for value, r for return.

416
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,610
Anybody know why that is?

417
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,273
Yeah?

418
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:51,245
AUDIENCE: We always
look about opportunity

419
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:54,696
that we miss so maybe we
can change the direction

420
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:57,670
of our money [INAUDIBLE].

421
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,110
ANDREW LO: Well, that's true.

422
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,734
But why focus on return
as opposed to dollars?

423
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,400
I mean, if we're
thinking about changing

424
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,230
the direction of
our portfolio, you

425
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,940
might think about
investing, instead

426
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,670
of a hundred thousand
dollars in high tech stocks,

427
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,370
take that money and invest
a hundred thousand dollars

428
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,660
in manufacturing.

429
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,730
It's still about dollars
and cents, isn't it?

430
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,169
When you think about your
portfolio, at some point,

431
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:20,210
you've got to look at how
much money do you have,

432
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,501
how much money did you have,
and is the current greater

433
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:23,230
than the latter.

434
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,840
You want to know whether
or not you've made money.

435
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,811
Why the focus on
r in this course?

436
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:30,310
Yeah, Zeke?

437
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,260
AUDIENCE: Could be to
get rid of the units.

438
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,760
ANDREW LO: I know, it
is to get rid of units.

439
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,551
But why do we want to
get rid of the units?

440
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,262
AUDIENCE: Compared
to their numbers?

441
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,470
ANDREW LO: But wait a minute.

442
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,085
Why can't you compare
dollars to dollars?

443
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,460
I mean, you're
right that you can

444
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,100
compare a 3% increase
in General Motors

445
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,320
to a 2% decline in Microsoft.

446
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,400
But you could also
compare a hundred thousand

447
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,910
dollar increase in your
portfolio in General Motors,

448
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,840
versus a $50,000
loss in Microsoft.

449
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,520
Yeah, Courtney?

450
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,894
AUDIENCE: It goes back
to scale because it's

451
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:04,200
a $50,000 [INAUDIBLE]
for that company,

452
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,225
but it could be your
entire company's profit.

453
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:12,230
So it shows a return on
an individualized basis.

454
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,850
ANDREW LO: It shows the return
on an individualized basis,

455
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,070
and it gets rid of the scale.

456
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,580
That's true.

457
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,030
So you're able to compare the
scale for different companies,

458
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,200
but what's wrong with
using dollars to do that?

459
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,490
I mean, if you're an investor.

460
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,470
So from the investor's
perspective,

461
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,810
if you're looking at an
investment in General Electric

462
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,230
versus Microsoft, wouldn't
dollars make more sense?

463
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,750
Rather than returns?

464
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,540
Because you can still
compare them, right?

465
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,040
Yeah?

466
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,964
AUDIENCE: If you're
going to invest

467
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:43,331
x amount in both companies, it
might create a greater impact

468
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,293
on one.

469
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:47,660
And you want to see where
your money is going to be or--

470
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,130
ANDREW LO: OK, you're
on the right idea.

471
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,570
You have the right elements,
but you haven't put it together.

472
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,780
It's true that
scale is the issue,

473
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,220
so you've got your finger
on the right concept.

474
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,230
But what about scale
is the issue here?

475
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,800
[INAUDIBLE]?

476
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,205
AUDIENCE: I think you want
to develop a theory that says

477
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:06,172
[INAUDIBLE], that
basically you can tell them

478
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,932
what's your return in
terms of percentages

479
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:10,890
and then they can decide
I want to invest $100,

480
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,770
I want to invest
a million dollars.

481
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,436
ANDREW LO: Good.

482
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,140
So that's following
in Courtney's point

483
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,820
that we want to develop a
theory that suits all investors,

484
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,700
so it's not focused on scale.

485
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,970
But implicit in not
focusing on scale,

486
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,176
we're making another assumption.

487
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,050
What are we assuming?

488
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,550
Mike?

489
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,889
AUDIENCE: In terms of focusing
on the marginal dollar,

490
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,826
you should actually
take the highest return.

491
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,246
If someone's going to
triple that $3 investment,

492
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:38,302
you should at least put
your first $3 in that.

493
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,625
Give them bang for your buck.

494
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,040
And then go down
until you're getting

495
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,570
to a lower marginal return
on larger investments.

496
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,460
ANDREW LO: And why
should you do that?

497
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,624
Why should you go down
the line in that manner?

498
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:53,972
AUDIENCE: Because that will
maximize your overall return.

499
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,180
ANDREW LO: But wait a minute.

500
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,480
I thought that if we
put our money across all

501
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,670
of these various different
projects in proportion

502
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,900
to the standard portfolio
theory, the tangency portfolio,

503
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,920
we get the biggest
bang per unit risk.

504
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,730
So, are you saying we
ought to deviate from that?

505
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,340
What about the theory
that we developed

506
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,900
requires us to focus on
returns, rather than on dollars

507
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,370
invested.

508
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,100
You've all been very patient
in not bringing up this issue.

509
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,160
You've just taken it as given
that I'm telling you the truth

510
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,690
about focusing on returns.

511
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,950
Why not focus on the actual
dollars that you invest?

512
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,469
Remy.

513
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,427
AUDIENCE: Focusing on
return is the easiest way

514
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:37,990
to weigh it versus the risk.

515
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,730
ANDREW LO: That's
true, it does make

516
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,590
it easy to weigh it
against the risk.

517
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,440
But in the end, don't you care
about what your dollars at risk

518
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,135
are?

519
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:46,676
AUDIENCE: You can't
check out what it

520
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:50,670
is on the tangency portfolio.

521
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,180
ANDREW LO: Well, I could rewrite
the tangency portfolio in terms

522
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,100
of dollars, instead of return.

523
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,600
AUDIENCE: You don't
want to do that.

524
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,641
ANDREW LO: I don't want
to do that, you're right.

525
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,810
Why don't I want to do that?

526
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,580
Aside from the fact
that the fonts are not

527
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,190
going to fit on that axis.

528
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,820
Well you're on the right track.

529
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,320
All of you.

530
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,207
I think you sense
what I'm getting at,

531
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:10,790
but you haven't put
your finger on it.

532
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,450
Let me tie it all
together, and tell you

533
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,449
where you're getting,
because I think that we're

534
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,315
going to get there eventually.

535
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:18,690
The idea is that we want to
come up with a framework that

536
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,830
applies to all investors.

537
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,070
That's true.

538
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,160
And so, it would be
really convenient for us

539
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,110
to be able to use
returns and units of risk

540
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,350
so that whatever
dollars you have,

541
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,330
you can simply apply
the theory and find out

542
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,957
where you are on that frontier.

543
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,290
And just simply multiply by
the initial amount of wealth

544
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,190
to figure out all your
dollar investments.

545
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,700
Underlying that
approach is a belief.

546
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,720
And here's the belief.

547
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,450
The belief is that we can invest
however much money we want,

548
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,070
and get these kind of returns.

549
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,770
That's the key that all
of you are groping at.

550
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,180
Implicitly, I think
you understood this,

551
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,870
but you haven't articulated it.

552
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,330
What we're assuming,
when we put down

553
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,640
all these equations
in returns, is

554
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,440
that scale doesn't matter
in the sense that no matter

555
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,550
whether we're investing
a hundred dollars,

556
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,650
or a hundred million dollars,
or a hundred billion dollars.

557
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,290
We're going to get
the same returns.

558
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,110
And the fact of the matter
is that's just not true.

559
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,500
Scale absolutely does matter.

560
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,590
It matters because
the more money

561
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,260
you put into certain
kinds of investments,

562
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,560
the harder it will be
for those investments

563
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,870
to maintain the same
level of return.

564
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,140
Now, that has a very
different impact

565
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,860
among different industries and
among different investments.

566
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,760
For example, right
now, nanotechnology

567
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,140
is just beginning to take off.

568
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,815
And so, if you end up putting a
couple of extra billion dollars

569
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:59,620
in nanotechnology,
it's unlikely you're

570
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,650
going to really affect the
returns because the technology

571
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,180
is still emerging.

572
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,410
But if you take a very highly
capacity constrained strategy

573
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,540
and try to implement
that same idea,

574
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,800
you're going to have a
very hard time doing it.

575
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,480
If you decide that you want to
focus on middle level software

576
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,220
for dealing with file
server control mechanisms,

577
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,090
it's a relatively narrow sector
in the technology sector.

578
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,420
And you want to put $2 billion
of extra money in that sector

579
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,160
this month.

580
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,390
Good luck.

581
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,247
You'll have a very
hard time doing it.

582
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:35,080
Not to say that people
won't take the money.

583
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,540
I'm sure you can find people,
yeah, sure give me the money.

584
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,206
But they're not going to be able
to produce the returns that you

585
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:44,020
would expect from that very
narrow slice of the economy.

586
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,700
So all of what we've
done in this course

587
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,360
ignores scale from the
perspective of risk and reward,

588
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,454
but the one area where scale
absolutely matters is NPV.

589
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,620
In other words, when you're
a project manager trying

590
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,250
to figure out should I take
Project A, or take Project B,

591
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,840
scale matters.

592
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,100
As Dee pointed out,
in certain cases,

593
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,270
you don't have more money to
put into a particular project.

594
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,250
In other cases, you
have too much money

595
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,070
that is not suitable
for a certain project.

596
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,850
But the bottom line
in both cases is NPV.

597
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,570
Dollars.

598
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,524
Actual dollars and cents.

599
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:23,190
That's what you want to focus on
from the perspective of capital

600
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,450
budgeting or corporate finance.

601
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:24,950
Mike?

602
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,432
AUDIENCE: If the NPV
is really, really good,

603
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:30,420
and the return is good, you
should go get more capital--

604
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,130
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

605
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,950
If the NPV is really,
really good, first of all,

606
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,600
you're going to
take the project.

607
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,280
But secondly, what
you're going to do

608
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,050
is you're going to try to
figure how to scale the heck out

609
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,870
of the project and take
as much of it as you want.

610
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,510
Why?

611
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,330
Because more money is
preferred to less money.

612
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,620
Simple as that.

613
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
And again, anybody that violates
that, see me after class.

614
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,940
Be happy to help you.

615
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,568
Yeah?

616
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,760
AUDIENCE: If you did that
it would go back to your--

617
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,190
ANDREW LO: Exactly, it would.

618
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,531
AUDIENCE: Or, it would change r.

619
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,540
ANDREW LO: It would change
r, that's the point.

620
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,320
That's why you shouldn't focus
on r from the perspective

621
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,430
of capital budgeting.

622
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,650
From an investor's
point of view,

623
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,200
from a point of view of you and
me, investing in the market,

624
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,390
we're not going to affect r.

625
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,160
I mean, I hate to depress
all of you, but most of you,

626
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,760
if you put your entire
wealth into the market,

627
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,480
you probably won't move
the market by a whole lot.

628
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,340
That's not true of
everybody, and it's not

629
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,579
true of all assets.

630
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,620
But it's certainly true
of the market as a whole.

631
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,340
In other words, if we put
all of our collective wealth

632
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,370
into the S&P 500, we're not
going to move it by a lot.

633
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,050
But if you're a
corporation, and you

634
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,950
put all of your corporate wealth
in one particular division

635
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,050
of the particular
company you're in,

636
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,376
that could have dramatic
consequences for the rate

637
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:43,500
of return for that project.

638
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,100
So scale matters for
capital budgeting.

639
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,070
It doesn't matter if you're
thinking about each of us

640
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,180
as a small investor.

641
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,660
And so what I derived for you in
the capital asset pricing model

642
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,950
is a derivation that
assumes each of us is small.

643
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,250
We're not going to affect
prices, or therefore, returns.

644
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,906
And so, we can take
returns as given.

645
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,530
In other words,
whether we're investing

646
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,940
$100,000, or $200,000, or
$15,000, or even a million,

647
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,300
the analytics that derived
are pretty reasonable

648
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,950
approximations.

649
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,470
That's very different
from evaluating

650
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,290
a particular investment
opportunity for a division

651
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,910
of a corporation.

652
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,040
That's not the stock market.

653
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,050
We use the stock market
as a guide for computing

654
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,380
the discount rate.

655
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,240
But the bottom line analysis
is how much of the investment

656
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,490
can be supported by what
you want to put into it.

657
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,720
And as long as the
NPV is looking good,

658
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,040
you want to keep doing it.

659
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,300
And to Remy's point, the
more you do it, most likely,

660
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,612
the less NPV will
come out, eventually.

661
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:51,070
And you're going
to drive the thing

662
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,736
into the ground in
the sense that you're

663
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:55,900
going to keep doing it until
it stops being profitable.

664
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,090
That's only human,
it's only natural,

665
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,504
it's only good business to
drive it into the ground.

666
00:29:00,504 --> 00:29:02,920
Which is, by the way, what we
did in the subprime mortgage

667
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,310
market, right?

668
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,310
That's why we're in the
current crisis we're in.

669
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,120
We basically drove that business
into the ground and then some.

670
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,000
But it's a natural phenomenon
of business practice

671
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,610
to constantly be coming
up with new ideas.

672
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,110
The ones that work
well, we're going

673
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,318
to keep on implementing them.

674
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,350
We give them more
capital until they

675
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,210
start declining in
their rates of return,

676
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,680
then we take capital away.

677
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,470
For the next year or so, we're
going to be taking capital away

678
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,678
from the real estate markets.

679
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,677
Any questions about scale?

680
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:35,260
That was a bit of a digression,
but a useful one, in the sense

681
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,170
that NPV is the right
thing to do because it

682
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,030
doesn't ignore scale.

683
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,500
Whereas, for the small
investor, ignoring scale

684
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,850
makes perfect sense.

685
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,340
Because then we are able
to derive a theory that

686
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,870
applies to most everybody.

687
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,160
By the way, that theory
doesn't apply to some

688
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,470
of the largest investors today.

689
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,530
For example, certain
sovereign wealth funds,

690
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,510
certain public
pension funds, they

691
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,410
can't invest according to the
basics of portfolio theory.

692
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,077
Because when they
put money to work,

693
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:09,160
they're looking to put a
couple of billion dollars

694
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,410
to work in a single investment.

695
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,810
It's not worth their
time to try to figure out

696
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,790
how to allocate $5 million here,
$10 million here, $20 million

697
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,290
there.

698
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,030
There's not enough
hours in the day

699
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,400
when they're managing
a $250 billion

700
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,870
portfolio to be able to do that.

701
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,100
And so, when you're a
large, large investor,

702
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,930
the theory that we developed
here in this class,

703
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,000
it doesn't apply.

704
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,790
You need to take 15
433 to understand

705
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,390
how to deal with the issue of
price impact and large scale

706
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,990
investments.

707
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,270
Fortunately, or
unfortunately, that

708
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,520
won't be a problem
for most of us,

709
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,620
so you have to
keep that in mind.

710
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,800
For most of us, the
theory of investments

711
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,120
that we developed in this
class is perfectly appropriate.

712
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,830
Except when we're
talking about NPV.

713
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,329
Yeah?

714
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,149
AUDIENCE: Because
of this lecture,

715
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,198
will there be any
indices or variables

716
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:07,470
that we can use to determine
the part of the initial returns

717
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,010
for those sort of cash flows?

718
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,260
ANDREW LO: In this
particular context, no.

719
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,012
You're going to learn about
that in 402, as well as in 434,

720
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:18,470
and some of the more advanced
courses on capital budgeting.

721
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,630
On how to scale an investment.

722
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,910
But the basic
principle, you, I think,

723
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,370
already know because you've
taken microeconomics.

724
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,160
The basic principle
of how much to invest

725
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,560
is not to invest until
you start losing money.

726
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,470
That's actually typically
how it's done in practice.

727
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,800
That's not necessarily the
best way of approaching it.

728
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,140
According to an economist,
the best way to invest

729
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,970
is until the point at which the
marginal benefits is actually

730
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,350
equal to the marginal
cost of the investment.

731
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,540
So when you're trying
to maximize profits,

732
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,470
you're asking how much
money should I invest

733
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,330
in a particular division.

734
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,340
You ought to keep
investing until the point

735
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,950
where the marginal benefit is
equated to the marginal cost.

736
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,100
In other words, where the
profit maximizing point is,

737
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,440
is where the marginal revenue
is equated to the marginal cost

738
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,400
of investment.

739
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,260
That's true for any
kind of an investment.

740
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,960
The point is to be able to
measure those things accurately

741
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,150
enough to find that point.

742
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,760
We don't do that in this
course because, again, we're

743
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,250
assuming that you're
relatively small relative

744
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,230
to the grand scheme of
the investment universe.

745
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,010
But as you get bigger, you need
to develop other techniques

746
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,280
to be able to deal with that.

747
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,150
And one is this marginal
benefit, marginal cost

748
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,480
approximation.

749
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,250
Other questions?

750
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,370
So that's the
profitability index.

751
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,920
I just give you a
couple of examples,

752
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,420
so you can take a look
at them at your leisure.

753
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,260
It's pretty straightforward.

754
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,760
All right.

755
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,050
Now, let me talk about the last,
and probably most important,

756
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,575
alternative to NPV.

757
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:56,950
This is something
that's actually

758
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,876
used in practice
pretty commonly,

759
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,250
and there are
certain areas where

760
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,450
it's used almost exclusively.

761
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,180
So it's a very
important idea that I

762
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,360
want to go over in detail.

763
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,660
The idea behind the
IRR looks simple enough

764
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,710
on the surface of it.

765
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,260
And those of you who
remember back to the lectures

766
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,590
that we did on bond
mathematics, you'll

767
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,580
recognize the IRR as
nothing more than the yield

768
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,840
to maturity of a bond.

769
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,480
So if you pretend that this
is like a bond, where i sub 0

770
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,352
is the market price of the
bond, and the cf1 to cft

771
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:36,760
are the coupons and principle
payment of the bond,

772
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,620
then the internal rate of return
is nothing more than the yield

773
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,180
to maturity of that bond.

774
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,810
That's mathematically,
formally what it is.

775
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,940
But it's got a different
interpretation here.

776
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,170
The interpretation is that i
sub 0 is the amount of money

777
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,800
you're paying for this project.

778
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,050
And cf1 through cft are
the cash flows you're

779
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,520
getting from the project.

780
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:13,380
And the IRR is that yield,
or that rate of return,

781
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,810
such that it makes the
project break-even.

782
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,980
In other words, the present
value of the future cash flows

783
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,409
is actually equal to
the amount of investment

784
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,860
that you put into it at
that IRR rate of return.

785
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,489
Any questions about
that definition?

786
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,440
Now implicit in
that definition are

787
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,790
a couple of hidden assumptions
that makes this work.

788
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,820
One assumption is that
the only investment

789
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,340
that you're going to make
in the project is upfront.

790
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,817
You're going to pay i
sub 0, and you're not

791
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,650
going to pay anything
more for that project.

792
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,940
It requires no more cash
inflows from you, the investor.

793
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,710
The second assumption,
which I guess

794
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,480
is sort of the
same as the first,

795
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,660
is that all the cash
flows are non-negative.

796
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,520
They're either 0 or positive.

797
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,650
You don't have any future
negative cash flows.

798
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,800
So once you invest in
your certain amount

799
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,040
today, then
thereafter, you simply

800
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,855
collect money from the project
that comes in over t periods.

801
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,570
If those two assumptions
are satisfied,

802
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,150
then this may be a
reasonable approach.

803
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,570
So just to be explicit,
the way that IRR is used

804
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,510
is for independent projects.

805
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,510
Accept a project if the IRR's
greater than some hurdle rate,

806
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,010
some IRR star.

807
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,100
You can think of that
as your internal,

808
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,900
or your required rate of return.

809
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,730
So as long as the break-even
IRR is equal to, or greater

810
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,860
than that threshold,
then you're OK.

811
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,760
Second, if you've got
mutually exclusive projects,

812
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,495
then you pick the one
that has the highest IRR.

813
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,750
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

814
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:19,407
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You could have

815
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:22,651
an outflow in the first
year, and you could

816
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:26,050
have an increase [INAUDIBLE]

817
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,550
ANDREW LO: I'll
show you in a minute

818
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,980
why you need that assumption,
those two assumptions.

819
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,504
In fact, when
people use IRR, they

820
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:32,920
don't bother with
any assumptions.

821
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,230
They just compute it.

822
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,110
So the assumption is to give
them the benefit of the doubt.

823
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,590
I want to come up with
conditions under which it might

824
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,660
actually make sense to use this,
and those are the conditions.

825
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,460
But for now, let's forget
about all conditions.

826
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,040
And let me tell you what
the problems are with IRR.

827
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,180
There are certain
situations where using IRR

828
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,970
will lead to the same decisions
as NPV, and there they are.

829
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,480
There's only one cash outflow,
which occurs at time 0.

830
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,500
There's only one project
under consideration,

831
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,630
so you have multiple projects
that you're comparing.

832
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,450
Third, the opportunity
cost of capital

833
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,720
is the same for all periods.

834
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,300
And the threshold
rate that you use

835
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,570
is set equal to the
opportunity cost of capital.

836
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,560
Now, the reason that
you need all of these.

837
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,130
I'm going to show you by
way of counterexamples.

838
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,230
But let me just tell
you right now, up front,

839
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,150
what the shortcomings
are of IRR.

840
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,930
Why you might want to think
twice before using it.

841
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:49,280
One is that in certain
cases, the IRR may not exist.

842
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,390
And in other cases, you
may have multiple IRRs.

843
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,820
I'm going to show
you in a minute.

844
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,550
Second, you're going to get
incorrect rankings for IRRs

845
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,540
where you're looking at
loans, loans meaning you've

846
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,330
got a negative cash
flow starting today,

847
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,240
and then positive
cash flows tomorrow--

848
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,900
Excuse me.

849
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,160
You have a positive
cash inflow today,

850
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,060
and negative cash going out
tomorrow and the day after.

851
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,890
Like a mortgage.

852
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,750
A mortgage, you
get money up front,

853
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,880
and you're paying
money out later on.

854
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,530
If you do that,
then you've actually

855
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,190
got to flip around the ranking
and take projects or loans

856
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,760
with smaller IRRs,
not higher IRRs.

857
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,080
And finally, it
also ignores scale

858
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,330
because it's a rate of return.

859
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,130
It doesn't look at
dollars and cents.

860
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,940
Zeke?

861
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,370
AUDIENCE: I have no
professional experience

862
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,355
but there's something
that simply bothers me.

863
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:49,480
You told that for, example,
that this model doesn't

864
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,980
work if you have
negative cash flows

865
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,415
and that people can make
mistakes and use negative cash

866
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,876
flows in real life.

867
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,824
How does this happen?

868
00:38:57,824 --> 00:38:59,772
Don't people have--
in this Excel sheet,

869
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,233
it's a simple calculation.

870
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,356
How is this allowed
in professional--

871
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:05,480
ANDREW LO: Hold on for one
second, let me show you.

872
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm going to show
you by example.

873
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,540
It's not as easy as you think.

874
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,940
Let me give you some examples
for incorrect rankings.

875
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,820
This is one example where,
as I said, with a loan

876
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,520
you want to pick the project
that's got a lower IRR, not

877
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
a higher IRR.

878
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,580
So that's one issue.

879
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,950
But let me give you an idea
of the nonexistence of an IRR.

880
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,260
Project one has two
negative cash flows.

881
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,633
One in the first period, and
another one in period two.

882
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,800
Project two has only
one negative cash flow,

883
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,370
but it happens in period
one, not in period zero

884
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,530
or in period two.

885
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,280
Both of these projects are
not particularly weird.

886
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,100
I know it's true that they don't
have negative cash flows on day

887
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,260
one and positive thereafter.

888
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,540
But I don't think you
would look at these

889
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,390
and say that, gee this
is really pathological,

890
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,500
or perverse, in any way.

891
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,320
It's just a different
way of structuring

892
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,160
your particular financing,
or your cash flows.

893
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,020
It turns out that in
both of these cases,

894
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,270
the IRR doesn't actually exist.

895
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,640
Now by exist, what do I mean?

896
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,480
Let's go back and look at
exactly how to compute IRR.

897
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
To compute an IRR, you
have to find a number that

898
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,840
satisfies this equation.

899
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,250
And so with k period
IRR calculation,

900
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,330
we've got k cash
flows over k years.

901
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,140
What, in the end, are
you trying to solve?

902
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,181
What kind of an equation?

903
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,441
Nobody on high
school math teams?

904
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:45,940
Andy?

905
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,480
AUDIENCE: kth order polynomial.

906
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,214
ANDREW LO: Yeah, a
kth order polynomial.

907
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:52,630
You all know what
that is, I hope.

908
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,260
Right?

909
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,870
Second order
polynomial's a quadratic.

910
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,930
ax squared plus bx
plus c equals 0.

911
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,690
A third order polynomial
has a cubed term, and so on.

912
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,460
A kth order polynomial
has powers of IRR

913
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,870
that are up to order k.

914
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,060
Anybody tell me how
many solutions there

915
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,040
are of a kth order polynomial?

916
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,680
AUDIENCE: k [INAUDIBLE]

917
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,340
ANDREW LO: Up to k solutions.

918
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,110
Do you always have solutions?

919
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,962
AUDIENCE: No.

920
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:30,612
k is obvious.

921
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:32,820
ANDREW LO: We're getting
some different theories now.

922
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,352
So some says yes, some says
no, some says where k is odd.

923
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:38,070
By odd I presume
you mean not even,

924
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,370
as opposed to weird, right?

925
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,320
it actually turns
out that you can

926
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,126
construct a solution for every
single kth order polynomial.

927
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,750
But that's if you
change the definition

928
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,120
of what you mean by a solution.

929
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,680
Right, exactly.

930
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,840
If you introduce a
new set of numbers

931
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,470
called complex number,
by that I mean numbers

932
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,470
where the square root of
negative 1 makes sense.

933
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,390
If you will extend
the number system

934
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,790
to include these weird things
called complex numbers,

935
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,960
then it turns out
that all polynomials,

936
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,350
all kth order polynomials
have exactly k solutions.

937
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,010
How nice.

938
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,740
The problem is that
these solutions

939
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,380
can involve complex numbers.

940
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,192
And as far as we
know, complex numbers

941
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:22,650
don't have any
ready interpretation

942
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,610
in terms of interest and money.

943
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,000
So in other words, the only
solutions that matter for you

944
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,130
and me, for practical
purposes, is

945
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,740
what are called real solutions.

946
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,570
And in particular, not only
do they have to be real,

947
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,380
but it would sort of be nice
if they were positive numbers.

948
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Because interest rates, again,
although they can be negative,

949
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,480
it's kind of hard to
imagine what that implies

950
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
over long periods of time.

951
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,990
So when I say that
a solution doesn't

952
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,700
exist for these two
cases, I don't mean

953
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,770
that they don't exist, exist.

954
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,050
Of course they exist,
they have to exist.

955
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,820
The problem is that
the solutions-- these

956
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,510
are two period cash flows.

957
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,650
So we're talking
about quadratics.

958
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,760
We all know the solution to
the quadratic equation of ax

959
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,110
squared plus bx plus c equals 0.

960
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,830
What's the solution?

961
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,788
Anyway tell me quickly?

962
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,770
Negative b plus or minus
the square root of b

963
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,120
squared minus 4ac over 2a.

964
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,070
Remember that?

965
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:22,020
It turns out that you don't get
real solutions all the time.

966
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,990
Meaning that, in certain
cases, that formula

967
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,825
will produce solutions that have
the square root of negative 1

968
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,250
in there.

969
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,820
And that makes no sense from
an economic perspective.

970
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,840
It just so happens that
in these two cases,

971
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,610
you should go home and try it,
and you'll see for yourself.

972
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,460
When you come up with
the two solutions that

973
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,299
exist for both of these cases,
they're complex numbers.

974
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:49,590
So I challenge you to tell
me what the right investment

975
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,400
decision is by looking
at those complex numbers.

976
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,440
It can't be done.

977
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,250
Which means that IRR
doesn't always work.

978
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,730
And here are two relatively
reasonable examples

979
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:06,020
that nobody should be
expected to look at and say,

980
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,930
ha, of course.

981
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,820
You can't use IRR here.

982
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,890
These are real life examples.

983
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,600
And by the way, this
is just two periods.

984
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,770
If I had five periods, and I had
some positives, some negatives,

985
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,440
it gets even more complicated.

986
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,630
So even within a
spreadsheet, where

987
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,880
you can see the positives
and the negatives,

988
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,020
and you can compute IRR--

989
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,850
you can do this in Excel.

990
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,850
And you should do that.

991
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,400
You'll get these weird
symbols that come up,

992
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,010
that will start
spitting up blood

993
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,530
and say that it
can't handle this.

994
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,150
Unfortunately, if
you did it MATLAB,

995
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,100
which I know a number
of you are likely to do,

996
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,330
you will get an answer.

997
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:43,910
MATLAB has no problem
with complex numbers.

998
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,490
So that's one problem.

999
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,820
Let me illustrate to you
though, where the problem comes

1000
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,080
with multiplicity of solutions.

1001
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,580
So this is a graph
of the polynomial.

1002
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,850
In this case, the
third order polynomial.

1003
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,910
And so what I'm doing
is I'm calculating

1004
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:06,280
the NPV of project
1 and of project 2

1005
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,300
as a function of the
underlying interest rate.

1006
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,820
And an IRR corresponds
to a situation

1007
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,390
where the NPV is equal to
0, the break-even point.

1008
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,210
What you'll notice
is that the 0's

1009
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,547
are where this curve intersects
the y-axis, or the x-axis,

1010
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,680
sorry.

1011
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,910
And so with the first
project, you actually

1012
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,320
get a unique solution.

1013
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,680
It only crosses the x-axis once.

1014
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,630
So you get a unique,
real solution.

1015
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,230
But if you take a
look at project 2,

1016
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,410
project 2 crosses the x-axis
once, twice, three times.

1017
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,880
You get three solutions.

1018
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,830
They're all real, by the way.

1019
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,500
You get three, real solutions.

1020
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,350
Which one would you like?

1021
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,990
Take your pick.

1022
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,610
You pick the biggest one?

1023
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,480
Or the smallest one?

1024
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,280
Or maybe average
them, or do something?

1025
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,870
I don't know.

1026
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:05,570
The problem is that with IRR,
If the pattern of cash flows

1027
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,630
is anything but
strictly positive,

1028
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,250
you get weird results.

1029
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:16,320
Now, I told you before that
IRR is used almost exclusively

1030
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,167
in one particular sector,
one particular segment,

1031
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,250
of the financial industry.

1032
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,614
Anybody know what that is?

1033
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:23,674
AUDIENCE: Bonds?

1034
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:24,340
ANDREW LO: Bond?

1035
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,580
Well, that would be a
good answer, you're right.

1036
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,547
Yield to maturity is
what IRR is in bonds.

1037
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:33,130
That wasn't what I
was thinking about,

1038
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,450
but you're absolutely right.

1039
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,200
IRR, in fact, is used
all the time in bonds

1040
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,700
because you quote
yield to maturity.

1041
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,700
And it's not surprising
because with bonds, you only

1042
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,700
have positive cash
flows, and you only

1043
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,620
have an initial payment upfront,
which is the price of the bond.

1044
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,300
So all of the criteria
that I required in order

1045
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,390
to make IRR equivalent
to NPV holds for bonds.

1046
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,000
But I'm thinking
about something else.

1047
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,150
What other part of
the financial industry

1048
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,790
uses IRR as a way of
making investments?

1049
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:11,080
And not only that, but
of quoting performance.

1050
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,650
What's that?

1051
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,340
AUDIENCE: Private equity?

1052
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,630
ANDREW LO: Private
equity, exactly.

1053
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,260
Private equity.

1054
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,550
In private equity, almost
every venture capitalist

1055
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:23,470
will tell you what their
IRR is of their portfolio.

1056
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,470
And there are a couple of
reasons for this practice.

1057
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:31,060
One of course, is that for
most private equity ventures,

1058
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,690
it is all about cash up
front, and then positive cash

1059
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,590
flows thereafter.

1060
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,910
Unless of course, you
require additional financing

1061
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,440
like mezzanine financing.

1062
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,110
In which case, now
you have a hard time

1063
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,030
using IRR for the whole thing.

1064
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,510
You could use IRR for
the separate tranches

1065
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,480
of investments,
and again, that's

1066
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,370
kind of an accommodation.

1067
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:02,050
It's a fix for trying to deal
with the weaknesses of IRR.

1068
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,120
If you focus just on
the particular tranche

1069
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,200
of an investment, you've got a
tranche of investment going in,

1070
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,920
cash flows going out, and it
all satisfies the NPV criterion.

1071
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,170
But the other reason
for focusing on IRR

1072
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,560
is because, again, this
is an issue of scale.

1073
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,510
You want to compare
two investments,

1074
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,612
and they may require
different dollar amounts,

1075
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:27,070
so you'd like to
be able to compare

1076
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,867
their performance in some way
that doesn't include the scale.

1077
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:34,450
Because you want to
be able to compare

1078
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,250
across a bunch of
different investments

1079
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:42,680
and see how each manager is
doing per unit dollar invested.

1080
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,560
However, the bottom line
of a venture capitalist

1081
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,579
is, I've got a billion
dollars to invest.

1082
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,370
I have to figure out
where to put my money.

1083
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,349
I can't afford to put my money
in smaller investments that

1084
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,140
are not going to give
me the kind of return

1085
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,460
that I need to have.

1086
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,260
So in the end, a
venture capitalist

1087
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,960
is going to have to
look at scale anyway.

1088
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,080
But for historical
and cultural reasons,

1089
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,340
you actually have the venture
capital community the only one

1090
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,030
that really focuses almost
exclusively on using IRR.

1091
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,750
And for their applications,
like the bond pricing example,

1092
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,980
it's generally OK,
but it may not be.

1093
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,110
And so you should
understand those conditions

1094
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,910
under which it may not be.

1095
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,630
So I want you to refer to
these, and if you have a moment

1096
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,730
during your holiday
break and you're bored,

1097
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,680
you might want to run a
few of these in Excel.

1098
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,910
Just literally try to compute
the appropriate IRR in Excel.

1099
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,010
And just prove to
yourself that you

1100
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,680
can't, that you get some
weird results out of that.

1101
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:48,130
Any questions about IRR?

1102
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,350
By the way, again,
there are no formulas

1103
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,690
other than the quadratic
for how to compute it.

1104
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,030
So in most cases when
you want to compute IRR,

1105
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,530
you have to use
numerical methods.

1106
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,280
You have to basically solve a
non-linear equation for a 0.

1107
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,710
So effectively, you
have to do this.

1108
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,840
You have to find the
0's of these equations.

1109
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,610
That could be a little bit
of an exercise to do that.

1110
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,200
There are other
examples here where

1111
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,090
I try to come up
with ways to fix IRR,

1112
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,730
maybe by looking at
incremental cash flows,

1113
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,880
or looking at different
ranking methods.

1114
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,420
But the bottom line is use NPV.

1115
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,150
Be aware of how
to compute an IRR,

1116
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,670
but you should
understand that IRR,

1117
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:36,740
in the cases where it matters,
either it agrees with NPV or it

1118
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,262
doesn't.

1119
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:38,720
And if it doesn't,
you can't use it

1120
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,690
because it's going to create
all sorts of contradictions

1121
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,515
and weird results.

1122
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,810
I want to conclude this
lecture on capital budgeting

1123
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,860
by talking about what people
actually do in practice,

1124
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,410
and give you a little bit of
a preview about what you're

1125
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:01,060
going to learn in 402 as well
as in 434 and other courses

1126
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,300
on corporate financing
and capital budgeting.

1127
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,840
Right now, as of
maybe five years ago

1128
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,080
when this survey was
done, for large US firms,

1129
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,870
believe it or not,
payback period

1130
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,030
was probably the most popular.

1131
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,010
It's the one that people
focused on the most.

1132
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,177
Again, not necessarily
exclusively.

1133
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:23,260
So it could well be that
people use payback period

1134
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,720
as one criterion, but they
use many others as well.

1135
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,530
But over 80% of the companies
surveyed use payback period.

1136
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,900
65% use IRR, which
is quite a lot.

1137
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,600
But again, a significant
fraction of that

1138
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,730
is private equity.

1139
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,100
And by the way, for
non-financial corporations that

1140
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,910
have private equity operations
within it, for example,

1141
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,420
General Motors has a part of
their pension fund devoted

1142
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,950
to private equity investments.

1143
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,560
They will use IRR as well,
because other venture

1144
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,960
capitalists use that.

1145
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,410
NPV is actually gaining ground.

1146
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,720
So it's now more
popular than IRR.

1147
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,380
If you surveyed multinationals
and US corporations

1148
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,110
20 years ago, it would
have been flipped around.

1149
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,500
IRR would have been way
more popular than NPV,

1150
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,200
but that's changed a lot
just in the last 20 years.

1151
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,500
However, when you look
at multinationals,

1152
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,460
you see that actually,
IRR is still more popular.

1153
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,250
So that's something
to keep in mind.

1154
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,140
When you're dealing
with foreign companies,

1155
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,170
they may be looking
at investments

1156
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:34,520
from a VC perspective, as
opposed to from a pure net cash

1157
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,500
flow NPV perspective.

1158
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,530
So that's something that
you'll want to be wary of.

1159
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,750
And by the way, that's
probably one area

1160
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:46,305
where you can make real
progress in terms of an impact

1161
00:52:46,305 --> 00:52:47,180
through your careers.

1162
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,860
Historical comparison,
this gives you

1163
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,950
a little bit of a
time series of how

1164
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,730
things have changed over time.

1165
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:01,250
So back in 1959,
payback period, IRR,

1166
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,020
was quite a bit more popular.

1167
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,860
Over time, that's declined,
and over time, IRR

1168
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,540
has gained more ground.

1169
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,280
But NPV, as of 1981,
was lagging far behind.

1170
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,060
And within the last 20 years,
we see this chart where

1171
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,460
NPV has caught up a great deal.

1172
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,020
A large part of
that, if you want

1173
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,103
to know where that came
from, a large part of that

1174
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:25,910
was thanks to Brealey and Myers.

1175
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,680
The textbook that
you're using now

1176
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,010
was probably the first major
corporate finance textbook ever

1177
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,980
written, way back in the 1980s.

1178
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,330
And Stu Myers and Dick
Brealey wrote the book really

1179
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,980
because there was
nothing else that

1180
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,310
was out there that corresponded
to these kind of modern finance

1181
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,390
principles.

1182
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,420
And so Stu and Dick
have a lot to do

1183
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,940
with these numbers as of today.

1184
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,570
Other issues that we were not
able to take on in this course,

1185
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,950
but which you will
see in 402 and 434,

1186
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:06,050
is how to deal with other
aspects of the capital

1187
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,100
budgeting process.

1188
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,740
For example,
competitive response.

1189
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,960
When we think about making
investments in projects,

1190
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,532
we are assuming
everything else as given.

1191
00:54:16,532 --> 00:54:18,740
This is sort of like putting
money in a stock market.

1192
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,573
When you put your money
in the stock market,

1193
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:24,470
you're assuming that the means
and the variances are given.

1194
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,780
That your investment
has no impact

1195
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,940
on the market as a whole.

1196
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,900
For specific kinds of projects,
that's not true at all.

1197
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,820
The perfect market's
assumption that we

1198
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,660
make from the perspective of
a small investor investing

1199
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,880
in the entire market,
those set of assumptions

1200
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,060
don't work for you
making a decision

1201
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,430
about whether to invest
in a new technology

1202
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,960
in your particular industry.

1203
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,510
Because most likely,
that new technology

1204
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:54,470
will have a very significant
impact on that industry

1205
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,610
if it's any good.

1206
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,026
So therefore,
you're going to have

1207
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:59,990
to deal with competitors and
the competitive response.

1208
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,270
Things are going to
change because of the way

1209
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,800
you make your investments.

1210
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,230
So that's something you'll
have to take into account.

1211
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,600
Capital rationing,
which means you

1212
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,249
don't have all the
money in the world.

1213
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:12,290
There's a limit to how
much money you can invest,

1214
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,500
so now, given that there are
limits to how much money you

1215
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,670
have, you've got to pick your
opportunities more carefully.

1216
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:24,290
And some of these capital
rationing requirements

1217
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,610
are implemented over
multi-year periods.

1218
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,730
So for example, you
might have a three year

1219
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,750
budget of $100 million to make
investments in new technology.

1220
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,679
Over three years, you can
use up to $100 million.

1221
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,220
So now, not only do
you have to think

1222
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,840
about how to spread your money
over opportunities this year,

1223
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,670
you've got to think
about a spread it out

1224
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,817
over a three year period.

1225
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:47,150
And you have to think about
spreading it out to projects

1226
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,430
that you don't even
know exist right now.

1227
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,500
So the problems, the
challenges, become much,

1228
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,100
much more complex
as you start making

1229
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,600
the assumptions more realistic.

1230
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
You've got now, the very
basics to understand

1231
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,810
how to do this for the
very, very simple cases.

1232
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,570
But the more advanced
courses will, one by one,

1233
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,760
relax these assumptions
and give you

1234
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,840
more tools to be able to
handle more complex situations.

1235
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,610
The examples that I
give in this slide

1236
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:18,170
are looking at short
run versus the long run,

1237
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,990
as well as dealing
with general noise.

1238
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,699
In other words, you may
be taking in lots of data,

1239
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:25,490
not all of that data
is equally meaningful.

1240
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:29,397
So you need to know what to
ignore, and what to focus on.

1241
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:30,980
That will be part
of those challenges.

1242
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:37,210
You'll get that in
402, and more in 434.

1243
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:43,720
So to summarize, we are now
done with pretty much all

1244
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,510
of the finance
theory that we need

1245
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:51,310
to value and to make decisions
on virtually any kind

1246
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:54,680
of investment that's out there.

1247
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,530
The key points for
capital budgeting

1248
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,220
is use NPV, or in the case
of more advanced kinds

1249
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,580
of concepts, APV.

1250
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,790
Take all projects that are
positive NPV, and if they're

1251
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,090
mutually exclusive, take the
one with the biggest NPV.

1252
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,250
Consider project
interactions separately.

1253
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,530
So consider the project
on a standalone basis,

1254
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,260
then consider any
interaction effects

1255
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,850
that may or may not exist.

1256
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,130
You can evaluate them
separately, and add them

1257
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,230
together at the end.

1258
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,020
Use after tax cash flows
for the NPV calculations,

1259
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,670
not accounting earnings.

1260
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,881
And when you need discount rate,
use the capital asset pricing

1261
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:32,380
model.

1262
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,440
The capital asset pricing
model provides you

1263
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,320
with a risk adjustment for
the required rate of return.

1264
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,710
And be wary about risks
that change over time.

1265
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:48,460
So every single year you
use your cost of capital,

1266
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,060
make sure you can justify the
particular risk associated

1267
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,840
with that year.

1268
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,630
Remember the example
of drilling for oil

1269
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,940
and how the risks
change dramatically

1270
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,900
as you go from oil
exploration to oil production.

1271
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,660
Those are two
different activities.

1272
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,160
Finally, think about all the
other alternatives to NPV.

1273
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,740
And you don't have to
be a snob about it.

1274
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,170
Don't tell people, NPV's
the only way to go.

1275
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,150
It's either my way
or the highway.

1276
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,900
You recognize that there
are other elements of risk

1277
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,990
and reward that may be
captured by payback,

1278
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:26,590
by internal rate of return,
by the profitability index.

1279
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,240
But in the end,
what you're going

1280
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,360
to want to base your
decision on is primarily

1281
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,570
NPV considerations,
with these other factors

1282
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,580
thrown in as well.

1283
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,910
I'll conclude with one
last comment about capital

1284
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:44,462
budgeting, which is
something that is completely

1285
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:45,920
outside the purview
of this course,

1286
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,947
but it's not outside
the purview of your MBA.

1287
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:50,530
And that is that why
I've been talking

1288
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,800
about for the exclusion of
everything else in this course

1289
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,300
is the economic and
financial considerations.

1290
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,910
Obviously, when you're
engaged in trying

1291
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:06,262
to get a project approved, or
making a decision on a project,

1292
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:07,720
there are many
other considerations

1293
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,280
that you should
not forget about.

1294
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,210
Considerations like
political, social, cultural,

1295
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,440
implementation, all sorts
of practical aspects

1296
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,640
that you need to put together.

1297
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,970
And so all of the other
courses that you've been taking

1298
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,580
are designed to try to get
you to think about that.

1299
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,180
But unfortunately,
or maybe inevitably,

1300
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,470
in a curriculum like
the MBA, we pick apart

1301
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,780
all of the various
aspects of a decision

1302
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,850
and then study it
to death, and try

1303
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:40,000
to come up with the very best
possible approaches for each

1304
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,820
of those particular silos.

1305
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,276
It's your job, ultimately,
to put all of that together.

1306
00:59:46,276 --> 00:59:47,650
And you will do
that, you will be

1307
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,540
asked to do that, whether
you know it or not,

1308
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,920
when you start working.

1309
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,830
So what I've been
focused on exclusively

1310
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,080
is the financial and
economic considerations.

1311
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,240
And I believe you
now have the tools

1312
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,100
to be able to
analyze any project,

1313
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,640
at least to get a starting
point for an intellectually

1314
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,352
consistent way of looking at it.

1315
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,810
But don't for a moment think
that those are the only things

1316
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,270
that are important.

1317
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,090
The political, social,
cultural ramifications

1318
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,460
are going to be
extraordinarily critical,

1319
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,380
and only you will be
able to figure out

1320
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,120
how to put that all together.

1321
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,670
So hopefully in this
particular course,

1322
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:24,130
you've learned something
valuable from that one aspect.

1323
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,140
But just keep in mind,
it is only one aspect,

1324
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,281
one perspective.

1325
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:29,530
And there are others that
you will have to incorporate

1326
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,910
into your way of thinking.

1327
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,650
That's it for capital budgeting.

1328
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,560
Any final questions
before we move

1329
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,021
on to the final
lecture of this course?

1330
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:42,520
Yes?

1331
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,454
AUDIENCE: I just have one
small question on IRR again.

1332
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:50,927
In the examples you showed,
the cash flows in the out years

1333
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:56,269
and years [INAUDIBLE]
were more, they

1334
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:00,060
were the opposite direction
from the initial year cash flow,

1335
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,290
but greater than the
[INAUDIBLE] cash flow.

1336
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,900
Does it matter that that's
not the case that can happen?

1337
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,110
ANDREW LO: Well, I guess
the answer is, it depends.

1338
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:10,420
In other words,
what you detected

1339
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,110
was not a universal pattern
that can be systematized

1340
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,390
and then incorporated into IRR.

1341
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,300
In other words, if I had
a longer period of time

1342
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,520
to be able to play
with changes of sine

1343
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,807
and changes of magnitude, I
can get any kind of pattern

1344
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:25,390
that you want.

1345
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,870
For example, in the
dotted line curve,

1346
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,870
I can have this curve
flip around the other way

1347
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,790
so that it starts
negative, goes positive,

1348
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,870
and it goes up like that.

1349
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:38,020
Just by changing the sign
patterns to something else.

1350
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,970
If I had a quartic
term in there,

1351
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,960
I can make it even
more complicated.

1352
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,770
So the longer the number
of periods, the more number

1353
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,870
of periods that I have
to play with, the more

1354
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,300
patterns that you can create
so that it would be really

1355
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,380
impossible to reduce
it to a systematic

1356
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:58,440
set other than this
proscription here.

1357
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,010
If these four conditions
are satisfied,

1358
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:04,810
then you're OK with using
this as opposed to NPV.

1359
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,570
But that's the only
simple case where you

1360
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:10,090
can say something meaningful.

1361
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,350
By the way, the number of
0's and the nature of the 0's

1362
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:19,790
of polynomials, that turns out
to be related to a very, very,

1363
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,920
very famous and hard unsolved
problem in mathematics known

1364
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,479
as the Riemann zeta hypothesis.

1365
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:27,520
We're not going to talk
about that in this class,

1366
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,103
unfortunately.

1367
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:30,430
It is beyond the
scope of the school.

1368
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,430
But I just want to let you
know that there is something

1369
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:40,180
inherently
extraordinarily deep about

1370
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,644
the underlying contradictions
that get generated by IRR.

1371
01:02:43,644 --> 01:02:45,310
You don't have to
solve the Riemann zeta

1372
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:49,510
hypothesis to understand it, but
you can get very, very complex,

1373
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:55,000
very quickly by looking at
these kinds of patterns.

1374
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,940
In fact, it would
be bad news for us

1375
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,000
if these patterns actually
mattered for investing.

1376
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,170
The fact is they don't.

1377
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,330
The bottom line is NPV.

1378
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,280
How much money
are you generating

1379
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,270
from this investment, period.

1380
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,180
And if you focus
on that, you're not

1381
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,130
likely to make a
lot of mistakes.

1382
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,650
But you should at least be aware
about these other techniques.

1383
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,200
So that's why I went over them.

1384
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,054
Yeah, David?

1385
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:19,720
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit more

1386
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,780
about social, political,
and cultural risks.

1387
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,346
From the perspective of the
CFO of a company for example,

1388
01:03:29,346 --> 01:03:32,490
who has to make a decision on
whether and where to invest.

1389
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:37,170
It makes sense that there will
be some political implications

1390
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,900
that cannot be captured
by every model.

1391
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,570
But if I'm a private
investor and I

1392
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,660
invest in a company that is
listed in a stock exchange,

1393
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,320
I would expect all these
considerations to be captured

1394
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,800
already in the stock price.

1395
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,410
ANDREW LO: Well, yes and no.

1396
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,802
Let me give you
an example that is

1397
01:03:57,802 --> 01:03:59,010
a somewhat controversial one.

1398
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,660
I don't really know
the answer to it,

1399
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,034
but at least we
can talk about it

1400
01:04:02,034 --> 01:04:03,660
in the context of
current events.

1401
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:07,480
If you take a look
at what happened

1402
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,340
with Bear Stearns versus what
happened with Lehman Brothers.

1403
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,560
It's kind of hard to understand
why what happened, happened.

1404
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,350
Bear Stearns was
deemed too big to fail.

1405
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:25,600
And so it was navigated to a
soft landing with JP Morgan.

1406
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,450
Lehman on the other hand,
which in certain respects

1407
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,940
was even bigger and
even more broadly

1408
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:37,100
intertwined in our financial
system, was allowed to fail.

1409
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,140
I don't understand that from
an economic perspective.

1410
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,790
In fact, I'm not sure there is
an economic perspective to why

1411
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:46,100
it failed.

1412
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,530
But there may be a
political dimension.

1413
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:51,950
For example, and again
this is pure speculation,

1414
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:55,910
so asking me for my views
on political elements,

1415
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:56,990
I'm happy to provide.

1416
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,560
But it's like asking
Roger Federer what

1417
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,460
he thinks about the S&P 500.

1418
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,410
Not that I'm Roger
Federer, but it's

1419
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,690
asking somebody who's a
professional in one area what

1420
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,023
they think about something else.

1421
01:05:10,023 --> 01:05:12,290
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

1422
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,690
But the point is
that my conjecture

1423
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,230
is that the reason Lehman
Brothers was left to fail

1424
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,620
was because there was so
much criticism and backlash

1425
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,720
from the Bear Stearns event that
both Treasury and the Federal

1426
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,100
Reserve thought that it was
politically untenable for them

1427
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,420
to do it again.

1428
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,670
Because if they did
it again, then they

1429
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,290
would be expected
to do it again,

1430
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,650
and again, and again, and again.

1431
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,520
In which case, all the
firms would be in line

1432
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,520
to try to get a bailout.

1433
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,380
And they are.

1434
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,600
However, to highlight
the complexity,

1435
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,860
to highlight the complexity
of the political dimension,

1436
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,940
now that Lehman did
fail and it caused

1437
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:00,980
such disastrous consequences,
now maybe it's truly impossible

1438
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,637
to let any company fail.

1439
01:06:02,637 --> 01:06:04,970
Because people will say, oh
you remember Lehman Brothers

1440
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:05,970
and what happened there?

1441
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,670
You better not do that again.

1442
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:11,060
So I don't know the answer
to the question about what

1443
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,750
the political landscape is going
to look like a year from now,

1444
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,010
or even six months from now.

1445
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,010
So I don't know
whether or not it's

1446
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,620
significant in terms
of what will happen,

1447
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,220
but surely in the past, politics
has played a very big role,

1448
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,714
even for private investors.

1449
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:29,130
But that actually wasn't the
politics I was talking about.

1450
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,217
That certainly matters
a great deal now,

1451
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:33,050
but the kind of politics
I was talking about

1452
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,070
was more within a company.

1453
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:37,340
So I'll give you an example.

1454
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,930
You're a new
division manager that

1455
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,970
was specifically hired by the
CEO to turn around a division.

1456
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:47,270
And in your first
quarter on the job,

1457
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:50,720
you propose a very
specific restructuring

1458
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,210
for that division.

1459
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,950
Chances are the CEO is
going to agree with you.

1460
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,700
Knowing nothing about
whether the proposal

1461
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,992
is smart, or stupid,
or good, or bad,

1462
01:07:01,992 --> 01:07:03,950
most likely, the CEO's
going to agree with you.

1463
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:04,730
Why is that?

1464
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,630
You know why, right?

1465
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,340
You guys agree with me.

1466
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,004
If you agree with me, that means
that you understand something

1467
01:07:10,004 --> 01:07:11,420
about the political
situation that

1468
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,720
has nothing to do with P&L,
nothing to do with NPV, nothing

1469
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,060
to do with cost of capital
or risk adjustment.

1470
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,160
Somebody just hired
you to do a job

1471
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,419
and they're going
to have to give you

1472
01:07:21,419 --> 01:07:23,210
the benefit of the
doubt for a little while

1473
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,550
before they can
pull in the reins.

1474
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,830
That's what I mean by
political considerations.

1475
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,080
So when you're thinking
about capital budgeting,

1476
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,157
you've got to factor in all
of these considerations.

1477
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:33,740
Which is hard.

1478
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,280
It's what makes business
both an art and a science.

1479
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,220
You need to have both of
those elements represented.

1480
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,810
And I just wanted
to bring that up

1481
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:45,770
to remind you not to forget
about those elements.

1482
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,740
Economists have a very bad
habit, myself included.

1483
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,950
We think that
everything is economic.

1484
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,840
Someone said that to a
person that owns a hammer,

1485
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,140
everything looks like a nail.

1486
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:57,942
And I agree.

1487
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:59,400
As an economist,
I have these tools

1488
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,230
that I think apply
to everything.

1489
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,860
And there's a danger
that as an economist,

1490
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,640
I see everything from
the economic perspective.

1491
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,660
And it's only after
you've been hit

1492
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,591
over the head with a bunch
of failures of your theories

1493
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:13,340
that you'll begin to
realize maybe there's

1494
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,950
something else out there
that's explaining behavior.

1495
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,149
Which I'm going to
talk about next.

1496
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:21,229
But the traditional
approach of economists

1497
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:23,490
is to assume that
everybody is rational,

1498
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:26,510
everybody's maximizing NPV,
the markets work efficiently.

1499
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,350
And by the way, if
that's the case,

1500
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,540
then your job is really easy.

1501
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:34,100
What makes it hard, and I would
argue fun and challenging,

1502
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,810
is all the other
stuff that makes

1503
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,930
this stuff not work the way
it's supposed to all the time.

1504
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:42,319
You have to know when
to use these methods

1505
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,149
and when to use other
methods in order

1506
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:47,420
to be able to advance your
particular objectives.

1507
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,640
And ultimately, you have
to understand exactly

1508
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,200
what kind of objectives
you want to achieve.

1509
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,200
So that's going to
actually be the topic

1510
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,680
of the latter part of the
next lecture, is objectives.

1511
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,350
I've told you up until now
that the objective for most

1512
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:05,000
shareholders and most corporate
managers is to maximize NPV.

1513
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,970
That is an approximation to
a much more complex reality.

1514
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,500
So I'm about to change
your view of that reality

1515
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,590
over the next
lecture and a half.

1516
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,380
Any other questions?

1517
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,490
This concludes our lecture
on capital budgeting,

1518
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,760
and what I want to turn
to now is the last lecture

1519
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:34,080
of the course, which is
efficient markets, lecture 21.

1520
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,529
I'm going to get started
on this just very briefly

1521
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:40,569
today, because we're
almost out of time.

1522
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:43,710
We've got about another
10 minutes or so.

1523
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:46,890
I want to give you an
overview of where we're going

1524
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:49,680
and why we're going
to do this lecture.

1525
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,680
Typically, efficient
markets is a lecture

1526
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,370
that is given in most corporate
finance and Introductory

1527
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:59,732
finance courses at the
beginning of the course.

1528
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:01,440
And the reason it's
done at the beginning

1529
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,550
is because actually, we
need this efficient markets

1530
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:09,450
hypothesis to justify
most of what I taught you

1531
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,960
over the last 13 weeks.

1532
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,130
Let me explain why that is.

1533
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,460
For the longest time
now in this course,

1534
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,860
I've kept repeating that when
we need a discount rate, when

1535
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,790
we need a price, when we
need a value, where do we go?

1536
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,510
To the market.

1537
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,500
All of you, right?

1538
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,190
And we did that.

1539
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:31,310
The first day of class, I
auctioned off certain items

1540
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,770
and we engaged in
price discovery.

1541
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,190
That's an enormous benefit,
this wisdom of crowds

1542
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,750
that we relied on.

1543
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,670
And that's why at the
very beginning of most

1544
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,970
of these finance courses, we
typically teach our students

1545
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,860
to trust in the market.

1546
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,480
Now I didn't do
that in this course

1547
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,760
because I don't want
you to trust the market.

1548
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,550
I want you to learn from
experience when to trust

1549
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,710
the market, and when not to.

1550
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,610
But the fact of the matter is
the theories that we rely on,

1551
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:03,370
this notion of risk adjustment,
this cost of capital,

1552
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,770
this CAPM.

1553
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,920
All of that relies on
people being rational.

1554
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,800
It relies on all of you
in this room wanting

1555
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,320
to hold the tangency portfolio.

1556
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,620
It relies on supply
equaling demand.

1557
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:22,320
And unless we have that kind of
behavior, a lot of our results

1558
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,340
go out the window.

1559
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,700
So I want to talk
about the justification

1560
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,760
for that assumption in
this particular lecture.

1561
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,920
I told you that I'm
going to tie together

1562
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,570
all the various
different loose strands

1563
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:36,970
of the course in
this one lecture,

1564
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:38,800
and I do mean to do that.

1565
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,874
What I'm going to
do is first of all,

1566
01:11:40,874 --> 01:11:42,540
make an argument for
why it is you ought

1567
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,780
to trust in market prices.

1568
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:49,320
Why the wisdom of crowds is
very wise, most of the time.

1569
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,290
But then I want to spend the
bulk of this lecture telling

1570
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,079
you why it can break down.

1571
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:55,620
Now, I don't think
I need to tell you

1572
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,090
that after the last 13 weeks.

1573
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:59,910
You've sort of seen
that in real time.

1574
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:04,140
But I want to give you an
understanding of what happened.

1575
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,170
And actually, I'm going
to be able to provide you

1576
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,530
with a complete and
satisfactory theory that

1577
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,560
makes sense of everything that
has happened over the last 13

1578
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,340
weeks.

1579
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,940
You may be skeptical about
that, but I promise you,

1580
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,040
it will be true.

1581
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,310
I have a theory, which is
not generally accepted.

1582
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,329
So I've got to start
with that disclaimer.

1583
01:12:25,329 --> 01:12:27,120
This is a theory that
I'm going to tell you

1584
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,020
that is my own pet theory,
it's not in any textbook

1585
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,514
because it's relatively new.

1586
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:35,430
And if you do a search
for it on the internet,

1587
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:38,070
my name was the only name
that's going to come up.

1588
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,830
So that's both good and bad.

1589
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,661
You're hearing it from
the horse's mouth,

1590
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,410
but it is a horse
that's telling you this.

1591
01:12:46,577 --> 01:12:48,660
I'm going to start by first
explaining to you what

1592
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,430
efficient markets is.

1593
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,930
I think you already know, right?

1594
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,460
You can trust the market prices.

1595
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,030
The market price tells
you what you need to know.

1596
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,730
And after I make
that argument, I'm

1597
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:01,260
going to then turn
around and take

1598
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,090
the other side of the
debate, and give you

1599
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:07,380
all the reasons why people are
irrational, silly, mistaken,

1600
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,160
stupid, all of the reasons that
psychologists tell us markets

1601
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,379
are crazy, and you should
never trust in market prices.

1602
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:16,170
And then I'm going to
try to bring together

1603
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,240
the two sides of
the debate using

1604
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,510
some recent research from
the cognitive neurosciences.

1605
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,240
So I'm going to actually talk
a bit about the neurophysiology

1606
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,312
of the brain, and it turns
out that that research

1607
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:28,770
is going to be directly relevant
to how we interpret what's

1608
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,570
been going on over the last 13
weeks, over the last 130 years.

1609
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:38,010
Let me start with that argument
about efficient markets.

1610
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:42,300
Market efficiency says
that there's no free lunch,

1611
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,730
there's no arbitrage, you don't
get something for nothing,

1612
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:47,370
prices fully reflect all
available information,

1613
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,940
and there's no way to make
money in the marketplace.

1614
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,080
Active management does
not add any value.

1615
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:59,130
Now, if you really believe
this, why are you here?

1616
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,800
Why are you taking finance?

1617
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,410
Well, it turns out that there
is a reason for taking finance

1618
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:05,700
even if this is true,
which is that finance

1619
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,620
is the language by which you
conduct discussion and analysis

1620
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,570
in business negotiations.

1621
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:15,860
But even apart from this, I
would argue that most of you

1622
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,230
are probably
thinking you can beat

1623
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,060
the market if you
work hard enough

1624
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,620
and if you're smart enough.

1625
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,170
That's not the perspective
of modern finance theory.

1626
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,420
So remember I was telling
you the difference to Warren

1627
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,130
Buffett and modern finance.

1628
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,480
They do part company.

1629
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,340
Warren Buffett
literally believes

1630
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:34,780
that he can pick stocks
better than you and I can.

1631
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,150
And what academics
would have you believe

1632
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:40,060
is that nobody can pick
stocks, that it's all luck,

1633
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,710
and what you ought
to do is simply buy

1634
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,300
the tangency portfolio.

1635
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,550
It's going to turn out that
both of these perspectives

1636
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:48,610
are wrong, and they're
right in very specific ways,

1637
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,730
and I'm going to show you
how to put it together.

1638
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,230
But let me first
start by motivating

1639
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,970
this idea of efficient markets.

1640
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:59,320
Why you cannot make money, why
all information is incorporated

1641
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,310
into market prices.

1642
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,920
And to do that, I'm going
to tell you about a research

1643
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,550
paper that was published in
2003 by two economists, Michael

1644
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,294
Maloney and Herold Mulhearn,
titled the complexity

1645
01:15:10,294 --> 01:15:12,460
of price discovery in an
efficient market, the stock

1646
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:16,891
market reaction to
the Challenger crash.

1647
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:19,190
Now this is a rather
somber subject.

1648
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:23,570
It has to do with an event that
occurred on January 28, 1986,

1649
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,270
at 11:39 AM.

1650
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,540
At that time, the
Challenger space shuttle

1651
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,810
exploded before our very eyes.

1652
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:35,570
Apparently, one of
the booster rockets

1653
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:39,590
ignited and destroyed
the space shuttle.

1654
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:43,340
11: 47, the space shuttle was
reported to have exploded.

1655
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:49,400
It came across the news
wire 12:17, Lockheed,

1656
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,920
which is one of the contractors
that built the shuttle,

1657
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,390
had no comment.

1658
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:57,080
12:52, Rockwell International,
another one of the vendors

1659
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,050
that built parts for the space
shuttle, they had no comment.

1660
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,820
This is all through
the news wire.

1661
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,750
And over the course of
the next several months,

1662
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,620
a presidential
commission was impaneled

1663
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,270
to study what happened with
the space shuttle explosion.

1664
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,220
And many of you
know, the physicist

1665
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,410
Richard Feynman
was on that panel

1666
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:22,980
and wrote a dissenting
opinion about what happened.

1667
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,560
But the bottom line, after
all the dust settled,

1668
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,120
was that in June of that year,
so about six months later,

1669
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,280
there was a report
that was produced

1670
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,570
that showed that it was an
O-ring, a piece of rubber,

1671
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:40,920
around a booster rocket that
ended up becoming brittle.

1672
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,520
And because it became
brittle in the cold weather,

1673
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,230
there were gases that leaked
from that booster rocket,

1674
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:49,150
and those gases
ignited after take off.

1675
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,450
And so in the end, after
all of this analysis,

1676
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:55,320
it was determined that
the O-ring was at fault.

1677
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,020
And who produced this
O-ring and the rocket?

1678
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,020
It was Morton Thiokol.

1679
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,920
They were the culprit, or
the weak link in all of this,

1680
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,210
according to this study.

1681
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:14,560
Now, this was on June 9, 1986.

1682
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,510
Let me show you what happened
to the stock prices of all

1683
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:23,930
of the different vendors
for space shuttle parts,

1684
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,380
right after the explosion
on January the 28th,

1685
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,580
six months earlier.

1686
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,350
Let me show you a graph.

1687
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,960
There are four vendors.

1688
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,220
Lockheed, Martin Marietta,
Rockwell, and Martin Thiokol.

1689
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:46,010
And these are the tick-by-tick
price changes, all normalized

1690
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:51,530
to start at $1 at the very
beginning of the sample, which

1691
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:57,380
was at 11 o'clock, or 11:39,
when the shuttle exploded.

1692
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,880
So this is where
we start, we all

1693
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,420
start with them at a dollar.

1694
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:06,890
Within minutes of the explosion,
I'm talking minutes now,

1695
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,450
not nine months or six months.

1696
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:13,670
Within minutes, we see that
the stock price that gets

1697
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:18,770
hit the hardest
is Morton Thiokol.

1698
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,390
All of them get hit.

1699
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:23,630
But by 1 o'clock,
Morton Thiokol's price

1700
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,012
is down below all the others.

1701
01:18:25,012 --> 01:18:27,470
And this is all normalized so
that they all start off at 1.

1702
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,560
So it's not difference of
scale, I've rescaled them.

1703
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,440
And moreover, at
the close of trading

1704
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:39,140
on that day, the only stock
that was down significantly,

1705
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:42,370
the only one, was
Morton Thiokol.

1706
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:44,020
They had to stop
trading in that stock

1707
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,145
because it was down so far.

1708
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,250
This happened in
less than six hours.

1709
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,190
It took the
commission six months

1710
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,750
to come up with the
O-ring and Morton Thiokol.

1711
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,910
Now, if you look at this,
you don't see an O-ring.

1712
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,920
But you see Morton Thiokol.

1713
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,909
Plain and simple,
like a sore thumb.

1714
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,200
This is what I'm talking about.

1715
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,037
This is the wisdom of crowds.

1716
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,870
This is why, when you
look at market prices,

1717
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,036
you should look at them
with a certain degree of awe

1718
01:19:15,036 --> 01:19:16,230
and respect.

1719
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:18,750
It's because it
aggregates information

1720
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,340
like you wouldn't believe.

1721
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,840
It's phenomenal.

1722
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,240
So this is what economists
like to trot out

1723
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,370
and say, see I told you so.

1724
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,211
This is what we're good at.

1725
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:30,210
What I'm going to talk
to you about on Wednesday

1726
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:33,750
is all of the other examples
of where this fails.

1727
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,012
So this is the good news.

1728
01:19:35,012 --> 01:19:37,220
On Wednesday, we're going
to talk about the bad news.

1729
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,360
OK, see you then.
