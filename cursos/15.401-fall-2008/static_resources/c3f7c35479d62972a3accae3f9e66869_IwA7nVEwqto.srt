ANDREW LO: I hope you all had
a good Columbus Day weekend.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,450
The stock market certainly did.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,790
Any questions from last time?

11
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:36,280
No?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,540
OK.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,420
So what I want to do
today is to continue

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,260
talking about futures
and forward contracts.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,990
Today we're going to finish
up on these interesting

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,480
instruments, with a
couple of examples,

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,970
and then with a specific method
for pricing forward and futures

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,720
contracts.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,400
So let me refresh your memory,
it's been a week, so I know.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,140
So we're going to go back and
look at a specific futures

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,640
contract.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,710
And I'm going to
take this contract

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,150
and then try to talk a bit about
how you might use contracts

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,050
like this in hedging
your risks, as well

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,150
as in making certain kinds
of bets, if you will.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,550
So remember that this
contract is a contract that

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,710
was issued on July 27, 2007--

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,940
so it was the middle
of the summer--

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,890
for oil to be
delivered in December.

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,610
And there's a specific
date in December

31
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,190
where all oil futures contracts
of this type will settle--

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,410
that is will come
to maturity-- where

33
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,290
the date is going to
be specified in advance

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,970
and everybody knows it.

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,150
And so in July, when
you buy this contract

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,520
at a price of $75.06 per
barrel, and each contract

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,650
is for 1,000 barrels.

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,680
When you quote
"buy the contract,"

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,840
what that means is that you
are agreeing today, July 27--

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,050
you are agreeing
today, that come

41
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,540
December you are going to
buy 1,000 barrels at a price

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,010
of $75.06 per barrel.

43
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,380
So that's the agreement.

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,330
And the party who is selling you
the contract, the counterparty,

45
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,570
is agreeing to provide
you with that oil

46
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,730
at that price in December.

47
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,050
So the futures price is $75.06.

48
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,620
And as we said last
time, the current market

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,540
price on July 27, 2007,
that's called the spot price.

50
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,850
The spot price may be higher or
lower than the futures price,

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,720
depending on what
expectations are

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,650
for what's going to happen with
oil over the subsequent six

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,870
month period.

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,410
Now the initial margin,
as I mentioned last time,

55
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,870
was $4,050.

56
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,270
The maintenance
margin, the margin

57
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,790
that you need to maintain.

58
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,020
So that if the initial
margin goes down in value,

59
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,630
you have to actually put
money back into your brokerage

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,120
account, your margin account.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,600
And if you fall below
that $3,000 threshold,

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,980
you'll get a phone call, which
is known as a margin call.

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,890
Several weeks ago,
somebody told me

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,180
that they've been getting
lots of phone calls

65
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,710
all from the same person,
a person called margin.

66
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:56,070
And you know that can
happen when markets go awry.

67
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,290
Now again no cash
changes hands today,

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,220
because the value of the
contract when it's struck

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,150
is a zero NPV transaction.

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,310
And how do you
know it's zero NPV?

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,360
Again, because if it's
positive for one party,

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,470
it's coming from
the other party.

73
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,320
So which party would
you like to be?

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
You'd like to be the party
receiving that positive NPV,

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,290
nobody wants to be the party
that is losing the NPV.

76
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,310
So the futures price
will adjust, in order

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,260
to make it zero NPV.

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,250
In fact, that's what we mean
when we say that it's zero NPV.

79
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,781
It is the futures
price that makes it so.

80
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,240
So I'll give me an example.

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,860
If it turns out that somebody
suggests a futures price

82
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,560
of $60 a barrel on that day.

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,450
Lots and lots of
people are going

84
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,060
to want to buy that
contract, because that's

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,960
a good deal relative to
where oil really should be.

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,560
And that means lots of people
are going to want to buy,

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,231
but nobody's going to want
to sell at that price of $60.

88
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,480
So if everybody wants to buy
and nobody wants to sell,

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,080
what has to happen to the price?

90
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,290
Exactly, it goes up.

91
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,650
And it keeps going up
until the number of buyers

92
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,000
equals the number of sellers.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,180
That's the point at which
it's a zero NPV transaction.

94
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,450
Now let's take a look
at what the payoff is

95
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:38,320
of such a contract on day zero,
in this case July 27, 2007,

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,660
the contract is worth nothing.

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,730
But if the futures
price moves tomorrow,

98
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,390
then the contract could
actually have value.

99
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,150
And a diagram of how that
works is something like this.

100
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,000
If the futures price--

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,434
not the spot-- the spot
obviously will move also.

102
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,100
But I'm talking about
the futures price,

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,150
because the futures
contract is specified

104
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,630
so that every day's worth of
gains or losses in the futures

105
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,740
contract relative
to its price, you

106
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,030
will have to either get paid,
or you will have to pay.

107
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,900
So this blue line
shows you the payoff

108
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,590
if you're holding a
long position in one

109
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,460
of these contracts-- if
you bought a contract.

110
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,490
If you sold the contract,
then your payoff diagram

111
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,500
is the dotted line.

112
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,870
Now the blue line basically
says that if the futures

113
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,480
price goes above $75.06,
then you make money.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,830
If the futures price goes
below $75.06, you lose money.

115
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,200
So when you buy a
contract like this,

116
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,680
it is as if you
actually bought the oil.

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,330
But you haven't
really bought the oil,

118
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,410
all you've done is
to buy the right

119
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,635
and obligation to purchase
the oil in the future.

120
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,120
Let me let me give you
another example that will

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,310
make this even more concrete.

122
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,020
The only way to
understand this--

123
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,580
because this is not a natural
security for most of us--

124
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,030
stocks and bonds you
might find natural,

125
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,960
futures contracts are
weird in that they

126
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,500
have zero investment today,
and so they're worthless today.

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,850
But they're not worthless
after the initial date when

128
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,150
you enter into that agreement.

129
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,550
So let's do an
example Yesterday,

130
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,920
you bought 10 December live
cattle contracts on the Chicago

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,260
Mercantile Exchange at a
price of $0.7455 per pound.

132
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,950
OK, so you basically
bought some cows.

133
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,074
And the contract size
is 40,000 pounds of cow.

134
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:06,490
I don't know how
much cow that is,

135
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,270
but even if you're on the Atkins
diet that's plenty of cow.

136
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,560
[LAUGHTER] And so what you
have though in this contract

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,240
is not the cows, but rather
you have the obligation

138
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,970
to buy the cows in December for
a price of $0.7455 per pound,

139
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,270
and there is 40,000
pounds of it.

140
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:37,270
So the value of your
position is the size

141
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,120
of the contract, multiplied
by the futures price,

142
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,850
multiplied by the
number of contracts.

143
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,400
So it's $298,200.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,990
That's the size
of your position,

145
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,440
or sometimes that's also
called the notional size.

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,410
You've heard that term over
the last few weeks-- notional.

147
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,080
Well, this is an
example of a notional.

148
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,510
So you don't actually
own $298,200 of anything,

149
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,110
because of course, we've said
that the contract is zero

150
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,120
NPV when you enter into it.

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,750
All you've done is to agree
to buy 40,000 pounds of cow

152
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,420
in December at a
particular price.

153
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,630
So the idea is that you
control the notional amount

154
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,790
of $298,200, and what
you do specifically

155
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:36,010
get is the profits and
losses from that notional.

156
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,600
So let's do an example.

157
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,280
That was the position yesterday.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,110
No money changed hands.

159
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,590
You got some initial margin
that you had to put down,

160
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,720
but that's really your money
in a brokerage account.

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,430
You're not giving it to anybody.

162
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,670
It's safety money,
it's collateral.

163
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,310
Now today what happens?

164
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,060
Let's suppose that
today the futures price

165
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,360
closes at $0.7435.

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,750
All right, it's just gone
down by 2/10 of a cent.

167
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,060
The value of cattle
has gone down.

168
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,320
Your holding long
this cattle contract,

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,350
maybe you're a restaurateur,
you have a chain of steakhouses,

170
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,390
and so you need to buy
cattle on a regular basis.

171
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,770
So the price of
cattle just went down.

172
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,051
Did you make money
or lose money?

173
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:31,540
Yeah, you lost, if you're long.

174
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,880
On the other hand, if
you're a cattle farmer

175
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,180
and you sold the contract,
you did a good thing,

176
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,170
because you locked in
the price of $0.7455,

177
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,610
and now the price went down.

178
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,480
So let's calculate what the
value of the notional size

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,410
of the position is.

180
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,130
It's $297,400.

181
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,280
That yields a loss of $800.

182
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,990
So you know what happens today?

183
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,880
Today, your broker will
deduct $800 from your account,

184
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,380
from your margin account,
and take that $800

185
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,250
and put it into the
cattle farmer's account.

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,400
So now he has the $800.

187
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Now, if the day
after, if tomorrow, it

188
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
turns out that the
price of cattle

189
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,360
goes up by 2/10 of a cent,
it goes back to $0.7455.

190
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,600
You know what happens?

191
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,280
You get $800 back.

192
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,600
Now the cattle farmer loses that
$800 and gives it back to you.

193
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,520
You see this way you
always settle up every day.

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,500
So if for some reason the cattle
farmer ends up going bankrupt,

195
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,070
and isn't able to deliver
any cattle to you,

196
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,940
then you're at out at most
one day's worth of movements.

197
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,480
And that's one of the reasons
why futures markets and futures

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,140
brokers are so careful
about closing down

199
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,430
accounts that don't meet
their margin requirements.

200
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,130
It's because they don't want
to have credit risk lingering,

201
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,670
growing, and unknown.

202
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,450
The first moment that you
do not make a margin call--

203
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,600
you do not deposit the requisite
margin-- the first time

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,930
that happens, they
have the right,

205
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,400
which they exercise always,
to close down your position.

206
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,040
You're out of the game,
and that's the end.

207
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,760
So it reduces dramatically,
the amount of credit

208
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,950
risk that either
counterparty has.

209
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't have to trust you
that three months from now

210
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,230
you're going to actually have
40,000 pounds of cow for me.

211
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,160
All I need to do is to make
sure that this contract settles

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,660
every day.

213
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,370
And the uncertainty then
gets resolved day by day,

214
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,130
but your credit risk is very
well managed, and mine is too.

215
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,310
So this is a very
important innovation.

216
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,280
It's very different from a
forward contract, in the sense

217
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,251
that forward contracts contain
enormous amounts of credit risk

218
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:10,750
right.

219
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,030
Because once we
enter into a forward,

220
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,260
that's just like a
futures contract,

221
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,810
but the difference is that we
don't exchange any money ever

222
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,120
until the settlement date.

223
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,350
And by that point you could
be so far out of the money,

224
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,670
you could be so
far in debt to me,

225
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,100
as well as to other
creditors, that you just

226
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,510
can't afford to pay.

227
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,760
And so I'm stuck with
this piece of paper that

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,520
says you're going to give
me 40,000 pounds of cattle,

229
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,820
and you can't even afford
to buy me a steak dinner.

230
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,400
That's a problem.

231
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,090
So this futures exchange
is a beautiful thing.

232
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,280
It reduces credit risk.

233
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,390
It also encourages liquidity,
it encourages trading.

234
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,010
Why?

235
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,360
Because at any point in time,
on any given day between now

236
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,291
and December, if
you decide that you

237
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,040
want to get out of the
restaurant business

238
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,804
and you don't want
this contract any more,

239
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:08,720
you can get out of it.

240
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
Poof.

241
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,500
You just get out of it by
doing an opposite transaction.

242
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,154
So if you bought a
contract for December,

243
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:18,320
you know what you do when
you want to get out of it?

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,390
You sell a contract
for December.

245
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,750
You literally sell.

246
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,160
So it's actually
duplicated transaction,

247
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,080
but it's of the opposite sign.

248
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,620
And so they cancel out, because
you're going to get delivery,

249
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,460
and you will provide delivery,
and those will cancel out.

250
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,300
Yeah, Justin.

251
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,180
AUDIENCE: The price of oil
has been going down lately.

252
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,420
So let's say I had a
long position in oil,

253
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,320
and then I found out that
I was going to really lose

254
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,650
half of that money,
and I decided just

255
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,532
to forego my margin.

256
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,460
What else would I have to pay?

257
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,660
ANDREW LO: Well,
first of all, you

258
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,860
are liable for all of the
losses, not just the margin.

259
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,440
So the margin
account is not meant

260
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,420
to be a non-recourse loan.

261
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,340
They will go after your assets.

262
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,230
Now you could
declare bankruptcy,

263
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,670
personal bankruptcy, and get
protection under Chapter 7.

264
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,520
But that will hurt
your credit ratings

265
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,550
and all other nasty things will
happen to you if that occurs.

266
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,710
AUDIENCE: So when you're
saying that they close out

267
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,930
your account, when
your margins down.

268
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,450
So they close it out,
but if your losses

269
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,860
are higher than your
margin was anyway,

270
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,450
so you're still liable for those
in addition to [INAUDIBLE]..

271
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,820
ANDREW LO: So you
make a good point.

272
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,670
Is it generally possible
that your losses are greater

273
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,970
than the amount of margin?

274
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,270
So in that case, who gets
left holding the bag?

275
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,920
You know who gets
left holding the bag?

276
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,650
That blue box in the middle, the
Futures Clearing corporation.

277
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,160
But the reason that they
establish a particular level

278
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,750
of margin is to be able
to ensure that that's

279
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,400
a very unlikely event.

280
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,080
And it goes back to what
are the likely daily swings

281
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,610
in the futures price.

282
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,980
If you put enough
margin in your account,

283
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,910
so that I can be sure
that 99% of the time you

284
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,030
can cover the daily swing,
then I don't have to worry.

285
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,800
Now, of course, if we had a day
like last Friday, or on Monday,

286
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,660
you know that's
pretty outrageous.

287
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,560
That's one of the reasons why
a number of futures exchanges

288
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
have increased
their margin levels.

289
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,880
It's because the daily swings
have gotten much bigger.

290
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,130
But as long as they can
cover the one day movement,

291
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,689
they don't have to go after
your home or your other assets.

292
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,230
Yeah, Dennis.

293
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,146
AUDIENCE: You said if I
bought a contract now,

294
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,230
then I just have to sit
on the same contract.

295
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,730
What happens if I bought at
a $1.00, it's at $0.50 now,

296
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,641
I can't sell at a $1.00.

297
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,390
ANDREW LO: Oh, no.

298
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,017
You certainly cannot
sell at the $1.00,

299
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,100
you have to sell at $0.50.

300
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,943
Says

301
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:49,980
AUDIENCE: So I'm not
really out of the position.

302
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,605
ANDREW LO: You are
out of the position,

303
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:55,100
because you don't
have a claim, or you

304
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,105
don't have a commitment to enter
into that trade in December.

305
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,480
That's what I mean when I say
you're out of the position.

306
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,909
You also happen to be out
of money in your example.

307
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,460
[LAUGHTER] In other
words, you lost $0.50.

308
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,980
That's not coming back.

309
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,680
But what it means
to sell is that you

310
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,440
bought a contract that
says in December you're

311
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,109
going to buy 40,000 of cattle--

312
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,910
you're committed to doing that.

313
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,980
Now if on the other
hand, the next day

314
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,357
you decide you want to get
out of that commitment--

315
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:27,940
the way to get out
of it is not to try

316
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,440
to contact the
counterparty and say,

317
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,300
would you mind
canceling my trade.

318
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,150
The way to do it is to simply
sell a commitment at 40,000

319
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,520
pounds of cattle for December.

320
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,490
So your commitment to
buy and your commitment

321
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,680
to sell, basically
cancel each other out.

322
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,710
So on settlement date, the
Futures Clearing corporation

323
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,550
will net out all of
these buys and sells,

324
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,070
and the net amount
will be transacted

325
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,612
between the providers
of the cattle

326
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,820
and the buyers of the cattle.

327
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,320
AUDIENCE: So this
means that there's

328
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,430
no physical delivery then.

329
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,680
ANDREW LO: That's right.

330
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,120
So that's an example where
if you bought and sold,

331
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,040
then you would be netted
out and you would not

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,270
have a physical delivery.

333
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,376
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

334
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,120
AUDIENCE: So if
the margin is just

335
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,470
a fund for exchanging
commodities,

336
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,175
what does the Futures Clearing
corp-- what do they make?

337
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,147
Is it a percentage of--

338
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,120
how do they make money?

339
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,610
ANDREW LO: Well, their job
is really not to make money,

340
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,090
but to create an
exchange for its members.

341
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,070
So many exchanges
are not for profit.

342
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,640
Some of them are for
profit, but the objective

343
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,110
of the Futures
Clearing corporation

344
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,970
is really not to
make a lot of money.

345
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,310
What they're trying to do
is just create a market

346
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,220
and let people who want
to trade with each other,

347
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,340
trade freely and efficiently.

348
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,980
They will charge perhaps
a small transaction

349
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,750
fee, that you have
to pay in order

350
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,550
to support the operations.

351
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,040
But they're not trying to make
tons of profits off of that

352
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,090
necessarily.

353
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,070
Now they may be trying
to make profits off

354
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,640
of other activities, but the
objective of the Clearing

355
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,380
Corporation itself is not
to make tons of profit,

356
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
It's really just to provide
a stable environment

357
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,940
where people can transact.

358
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,870
And in some cases, the
members of the exchange

359
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,850
own the Clearing Corporation.

360
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,790
So it's their own
dollars that support

361
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,865
the actual physical operations
of the organization.

362
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,656
AUDIENCE: And just
going back to that point

363
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,400
you had about no
physical delivery.

364
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,105
Two or three weeks
ago, the price

365
00:19:22,105 --> 00:19:25,340
of oil spiked,
[INAUDIBLE] I think

366
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,152
the way I read in the
papers, was people

367
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:30,225
were trying to sell it, not
buy it, because otherwise they

368
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,420
would get physical delivery.

369
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,250
So do you recall that?

370
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,220
ANDREW LO: I recall the spike.

371
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,620
I certainly don't recall the
logic about physical delivery.

372
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,710
I mean it could be that
there are a number of people

373
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,180
who are long the oil
contracts that basically

374
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,710
want it to be cash settled.

375
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,460
And the way that they
have it cash settled

376
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,400
at a particular point in
time, before settlement date,

377
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,357
is they close out
their positions.

378
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,940
And so by closing
out their positions,

379
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,680
they basically
reverse the trade,

380
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,402
and that would actually
push down the oil price.

381
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,610
So maybe the reverse argument,
a lot of short sellers

382
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,670
were trying to argue that
oil was going to go down,

383
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,810
and they wanted to cover their
position, so they bought.

384
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,820
In any case, you don't have
to take physical delivery

385
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,730
if you specify to your broker
that you want all of this

386
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,482
to be cash settled.

387
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:20,364
Yeah?

388
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:21,700
AUDIENCE: Two part question.

389
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
Would you say that the
credit risk involved

390
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,440
in a forward contract is
somewhat similar to the credit

391
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,530
risk in credit default swaps?

392
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,590
And if so, is there something
analogous to a credit default

393
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,702
swap that's similar
to a futures contract?

394
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,660
ANDREW LO: So the answer
to your first question

395
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,280
is yes, because a credit default
swap contract is basically

396
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,320
a kind of a forward contract.

397
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,690
It does involve
intermediate payments,

398
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,064
but if it turns out that the
credit changes dramatically,

399
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,480
those intermediate
payments either

400
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,120
may be too much or not enough
to cover the underlying

401
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,390
value of the contract.

402
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,420
And after you strike
a credit default swap,

403
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,330
it will take on value.

404
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,230
As for an exchange,
what a wonderful idea.

405
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,660
That is exactly what's
being proposed now.

406
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,880
It hasn't been
done yet, but there

407
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,710
have been a number of
proposals to set up

408
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,580
exactly a structure like this
for credit default swaps.

409
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,380
In order to do that, you have
to standardize those contracts,

410
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,440
and you have to be able to do
the paperwork in a relatively

411
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
efficient manner.

412
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,910
And so that's actually
being discussed, debated,

413
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,250
and I think that there's
a proposal by the Chicago

414
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,950
Mercantile Exchange
to start doing that.

415
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,070
If you do start doing that, you
will see that market growing

416
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,610
even bigger than it is
today, and at the same time,

417
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,280
the risks are actually
going to decrease.

418
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,400
Because with daily settlement
of credit default swaps,

419
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,860
just like with futures
contracts, all you need

420
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:55,280
is one day margin in order to
eliminate 99% of the problems.

421
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:05,534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

422
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,450
ANDREW LO: So let me--
that's a good question.

423
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,850
Let me now talk about
how to price futures

424
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,850
and we'll take in
interest rates explicitly.

425
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,490
So the question is what
determines either a forward

426
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,620
or a futures price?

427
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,750
You now know what a
futures price is, right?

428
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,080
It's the price at which
you're willing to do

429
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,286
a future transaction.

430
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:28,410
What determines that price?

431
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,750
We say supply and
demand and the market,

432
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,750
but is there some logic that
we can give to this process?

433
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,240
And the answer is
yes, we're going

434
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,040
to use the exact same
argument that we use

435
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,900
for pricing everything else.

436
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,160
We're going to come up with
two identical cash flows.

437
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,450
And two assets that have
identical cash flows

438
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,246
have to have the same what?

439
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,070
AUDIENCE: Price.

440
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,430
ANDREW LO: Price, value, right.

441
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,110
So for now, I'm going to
actually ignore the difference

442
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,030
between futures and forwards.

443
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,530
The only difference is the
back and forth amount of money

444
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,810
that we give to each
other, and therefore,

445
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,410
the accumulated interest
or foregone interest

446
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,040
that we pay when we put
our money back and forth

447
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,870
into each other's accounts.

448
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,799
So let me abstract
from that and-- you

449
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,590
know if you're interested,
you can actually

450
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,250
see the derivation of
that in recitation.

451
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,740
I want to focus on
the bigger question

452
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,140
of how these things are priced
with respect to other prices.

453
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,350
So let me start
with some notation.

454
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,335
I've got a particular
contract, let's say a futures

455
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,240
or a forward contract.

456
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,780
And I've also got the
spot price of the asset

457
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,170
at a point in time.

458
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,220
So I'm going to let St
denote my spot price.

459
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,470
I'm going to let F
of little t big T

460
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,610
determine the forward price.

461
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,619
And H of little t big
T, the futures price.

462
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:01,160
And for now, I'm
going to just assume

463
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,860
that H and F are pretty close.

464
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,700
Now notice that
when I write down

465
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,960
a futures price or
a forward price,

466
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
I've got two sub-indexes.

467
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
I've got little t
and big T. The reason

468
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,780
I need two is that for every
forward or futures contract,

469
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,600
there are two dates you
need to worry about.

470
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,410
The date at which you are
pricing the contract, namely

471
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,620
today, and the settlement date.

472
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,460
So you need to have
those two indexes.

473
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,180
So right away we know
that this contract

474
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,450
is a little bit more
complicated than say a stock,

475
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,000
where there is no
settlement date.

476
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,914
So I want to go back
to a comment that

477
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,080
was made by one of you when
we first started talking

478
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,370
about futures and forwards.

479
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,310
And the comment was why
go to the trouble of using

480
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,810
these contracts,
when you could just

481
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,810
buy the asset itself
and hold onto it.

482
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,600
If you need oil in
December, in order

483
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,550
to make sure you
have oil in December,

484
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,560
why don't you just
buy it in October

485
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,810
and hold it for two months.

486
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,950
Then you have it in December.

487
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,650
And in fact, that's
exactly what we're

488
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,820
going to do to figure out
what the appropriate price is

489
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,250
of the specific futures
or forward contract.

490
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,680
So here we go.

491
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,170
I'm going to do my
exact same analysis

492
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,300
that I've done
many times before,

493
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,660
when we tried to price
bonds, and stocks,

494
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,380
and other basic securities.

495
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,690
The left hand
column here is going

496
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,400
to be the cash flows
associated with

497
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,140
a typical forward contract.

498
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,760
So a forward
contract is one way.

499
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,330
You enter into the contract,
let's say at date zero.

500
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,540
And you pay nothing
for the contract right,

501
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,070
this is a zero NPV transaction.

502
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,820
And you are long the
forward contract,

503
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,220
with the forward price F of 0,T.

504
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,280
The only cash flow that
occurs with a forward contract

505
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,350
is on settlement date.

506
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,690
And on settlement date,
you've agreed to pay F of 0,T

507
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,840
for delivery of whatever it
is that you bought the forward

508
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,620
contract on.

509
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:18,080
So the only cash flow that
comes out of a forward contract

510
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,730
is this F right here.

511
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,800
Everybody see that?

512
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,860
Nothing up my sleeve, it's
very simple calculation.

513
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,290
Now, I want you to look at
the right hand column, which

514
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,540
is going to be less simple.

515
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,820
The right hand
column, I want you

516
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,420
to imagine doing the following.

517
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,430
I want you to imagine buying
the commodity at date zero.

518
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:49,490
However, I don't want
you to use any money.

519
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,330
I want you to buy it
with no money down.

520
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,720
That's the start of a
scam, it sounds like it,

521
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,360
but I promise you it's not.

522
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,135
So the way you're going
to buy the commodity

523
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:05,750
is you have to pay the
price, the spot price.

524
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,150
And the spot prices
is S sub 0 You don't

525
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,980
have S sub 0, so borrow it.

526
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,900
Now, I'm going to
abstract from credit

527
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,862
risk, which I know is on
everybody's minds today.

528
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:19,820
But let's suppose that
you're all good credits,

529
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,420
so I'm not worried about loaning
you the money at the risk

530
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,560
free rate.

531
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,820
So now you've borrowed
S sub 0 dollars,

532
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,800
and then you spent it right
away buying the asset.

533
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:40,730
So as of date zero, in the right
hand column, you own the asset.

534
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:49,810
Now you have to wait T
periods, and while you wait

535
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,370
you may have some costs.

536
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,000
For example, if the asset
that you bought is gasoline,

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,206
well you've got to store
it in just the right way.

538
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:00,580
You probably don't
want to put it

539
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,980
next to your furnace
in the basement.

540
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,830
You probably want to put it
in a cool place, isolated,

541
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,550
and so on and so forth.

542
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,440
On the other hand, if what
you bought is pork bellies,

543
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,890
you probably want to put that
in a freezer compartment, as

544
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,280
opposed to in your garage.

545
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,900
So you might have to
pay costs for storing.

546
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,530
And at the end of
that time T, you

547
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,000
have to pay interest
on your loan.

548
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,149
So you borrowed S
sub 0 dollars, you

549
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:33,440
don't get that for free, you
got to pay interest on it.

550
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,856
This is a question
about interest,

551
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,910
so you've got to pay
interest on that money.

552
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,355
And so you have to pay
back at this point T--

553
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,230
you have to pay back
the money you borrowed--

554
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,830
S sub 0, 1 plus R
to the capital T,

555
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,150
plus whatever your
storage costs are.

556
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,220
But I'm going to allow
that having the asset

557
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,700
around might be
kind of convenient.

558
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,090
There might be a benefit to
having the asset around--

559
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,530
a convenience yield.

560
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,440
Maybe if you need to use it
sooner, you have it there.

561
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,290
And having it there saves you a
little bit of trouble in order

562
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,060
to be able to get
whatever it is you

563
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,820
need to get done with
that underlying asset.

564
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,740
So I'm going to deduct from
my cumulative storage costs

565
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,260
any convenience yield--

566
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,310
that's future speak for
any kind of benefits

567
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,150
that you get from holding
onto the physical asset.

568
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,020
So your net storage
costs are given here--

569
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,705
that's what you pay at
the end of T periods.

570
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,610
I argue that these two
cash flows give you

571
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,120
the exact same
value of the asset.

572
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,900
In other words,
in both cases you

573
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,570
happen to have the
asset at the time T.

574
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,140
So these two contracts
have to have the same value

575
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,660
because they offer the
same set of cash flows,

576
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,960
in terms of the
underlying commodity.

577
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,550
You get the commodity
in both cases.

578
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,930
So another way of thinking
about it is if your objective is

579
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:23,450
to have 40,000 pounds of cattle
in December, both of these

580
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,270
will get you to the
exact same point.

581
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,110
Both of these costs you
nothing on date zero.

582
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,950
And therefore, if
they cost you nothing,

583
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,490
and they give you the
same outcome at the end,

584
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,390
they've got to sell
for the same price.

585
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,101
So this has to equal this.

586
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:49,600
That's it.

587
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,220
That's the simple argument.

588
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,020
And the counter argument or
proof that this has to be true

589
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,030
is-- let's assume it's not.

590
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,660
Let's assume that this is
a lot bigger than this.

591
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,512
Well, if this is bigger than
this, then what should you do?

592
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,012
What?

593
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:12,112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

594
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:12,820
ANDREW LO: Right.

595
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,410
Which one?

596
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,360
Which one?

597
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Sell the forward
contract, and then

598
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,892
buy this thing,
whatever it is, do this.

599
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:24,100
Now what if it's the reverse?

600
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,260
What if this is
bigger than this?

601
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:32,320
Then buy the forward, and
then do the opposite of this.

602
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,460
Flip it around.

603
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,050
Short sell the asset if you
can, and then take the money

604
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:42,040
and lend it out at interest
rate r, and dot dot dot,

605
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,980
you follow the logic.

606
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,170
So that gives us a relationship
between the forward price

607
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,920
and other stuff.

608
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,320
And what is the other stuff?

609
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,680
The forward price
has to be related

610
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:02,560
to the spot price, the interest
rate, the time to settlement,

611
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,030
and any other weird things
about the commodity that

612
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,740
may affect the value of it.

613
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,436
Like the storage costs or
the convenience yield--

614
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:17,760
you've got to factor that in.

615
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,980
So this is the relationship
that tells you how

616
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,140
to price a forward contract.

617
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,470
Now a futures contract
is almost like a forward.

618
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,450
The only difference is
the interest differential

619
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,190
on a daily basis, where you
actually are moving money back

620
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,230
and forth into our accounts.

621
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,470
But the cumulative
sum is going to end up

622
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,270
being approximately the same.

623
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,500
So for the purposes
of this class,

624
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,760
I'm going to assert that this
is approximately the same.

625
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,350
In fact, you can
show that there's

626
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,630
another relationship that
looks at the interest

627
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,410
rate per period.

628
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,454
And it's a little bit
more complicated, but not

629
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:54,370
much more complicated.

630
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,280
You can see that in your
textbook, if you're interested.

631
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,240
But for now, I want to just
focus on this relationship.

632
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,070
This relationship tells us how
to price futures and forwards.

633
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,760
And now if I divide by 1 plus r,
f to the T, then what I've got

634
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,890
is that the forward price
divided by the interest rate,

635
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,140
that calculates the current
value of that forward price,

636
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,680
has got to equal the spot
price plus the present value

637
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,702
of the net storage costs.

638
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:29,910
This is the relationship
that we've been looking for,

639
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,270
and you guys have been
struggling for the last couple

640
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,810
of lectures.

641
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,520
You've been asking well,
gee, doesn't the interest

642
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,880
rate belong in there, and
what about having the asset,

643
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,420
wouldn't it be nice to have
it, and so on and so forth.

644
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,020
All of those considerations
are summed up

645
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,870
in this one expression.

646
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,830
A very nice expression.

647
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,930
Very intuitive.

648
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,160
What you pay at date T, when you
take the present value of it,

649
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,500
that has to be equal to what
the thing is worth today

650
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,230
plus any benefits for
having the thing, as opposed

651
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,600
to not having the thing
between now and settlement.

652
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,090
That's it.

653
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,300
Now this is for
the very beginning

654
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,949
when you strike the contract.

655
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:20,659
What about at an arbitrary
point in time between 0 and T?

656
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,530
Well, all of these arguments
work exactly the same way

657
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:30,830
when you're looking at two dates
t and T, as opposed to 0 and T.

658
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,836
So the relationship
that I showed you,

659
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,460
it's a little bit
more complicated now,

660
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,550
because you've got to take into
account the fact that the time

661
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,889
to settlement is
not capital T, it's

662
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,310
capital T minus
where you are today.

663
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,050
But that's the only change.

664
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,020
Other than that,
everything is the same.

665
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,330
And you have to make
sure that you accumulate

666
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,840
the future value of all
the net storage costs,

667
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,750
so that you actually move
all of the costs to the end,

668
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,340
and then you bring
it back to time T.

669
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,380
Now, let's take
this out for a spin.

670
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,070
Let's see how this works.

671
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,250
Let's take a look at gold.

672
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,170
Gold is easy to store.

673
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,470
There's no storage costs really.

674
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,010
I mean gold is relatively
compact, a little heavy,

675
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,510
so you're going to have to lift
it and put it in your vault,

676
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,385
as some of you, I'm
sure, are doing nowadays.

677
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:35,490
[LAUGHTER] But the bottom
line is that the storage costs

678
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,320
are negligible.

679
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
There are no dividends.

680
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,640
Gold does not pay out dividends.

681
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,040
There are no real
benefits either,

682
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,765
there is no convenience yield.

683
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:48,480
It's not like you need
a little piece of gold

684
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,500
every once in a while
for your pleasure,

685
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
and so you want to scrape
that off and enjoy it.

686
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,120
[LAUGHTER] It just
sort of sits there.

687
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,810
So if that's the
case, you factor that

688
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,640
into that relationship
that I showed you,

689
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,980
and that last term, the PV of
net storage costs is nothing.

690
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,720
And so the relationship
is really simple.

691
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,390
The forward slash
futures price today

692
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,930
is just equal to
what the current spot

693
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,730
price is multiplied by 1 plus
the risk free rate of interest

694
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,090
between today and
a settlement date.

695
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,340
If this relationship
is violated--

696
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,210
when you look at gold
futures, and gold spot,

697
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,140
and you see that this
relationship was violated,

698
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,300
that's a sign that
there's an arbitrage.

699
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,380
You can make money off of that.

700
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,890
So that really is the way
to make a million dollars

701
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,350
with no money down--

702
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:50,160
is to try to find violations
of this arbitrage relationship.

703
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,770
It's going to be hard, because
there are a lot of people that

704
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,080
are looking at it all the time.

705
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,150
And so when there is an
inequality of some sort,

706
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,820
it's probably not
going to be very big,

707
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,770
and it probably
won't last very long.

708
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,590
But to the person
who found it first,

709
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,020
they might actually be able
to make a little bit off

710
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,920
of that discrepancy, by
either buying or selling gold,

711
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,860
and transacting these
markets quickly.

712
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,160
Let me do another example.

713
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,140
So this is gold.

714
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,370
What about gasoline?

715
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,850
Gasoline it turns out, is
very different from gold.

716
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,910
First of all, it's a pain
in the neck to store safely.

717
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,300
So if you don't want to be
blown up in the middle--

718
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,590
and this is what I really mean
by blowing up right, gasoline--

719
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,610
you want to prevent
that from happening,

720
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,310
you've got to pay
a storage cost.

721
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,310
On the other hand, there
is a convenience yield.

722
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,810
If you've got the
gasoline, you can actually

723
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,244
use it along the way.

724
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:42,660
You have to replenish
it, in order

725
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,930
to get the same level
of stock at the end,

726
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,420
but it's convenient
that you have it,

727
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,010
instead of having to go get it.

728
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,150
Because getting it
involves trouble and costs.

729
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,850
So that's the convenience yield.

730
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,360
So if you factor that in, then
what you get is the futures

731
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:13,470
or forward price is equal to 1
plus r,f plus a plus a storage

732
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,370
cost per period, minus a
convenience yield per period,

733
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,790
and then raised to
the T minus t power,

734
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,720
multiplied by the
current spot price.

735
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,570
If this is violated,
then you're going

736
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,244
to want to do one of two things.

737
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,410
Either you're going to want
to buy your own gasoline

738
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,370
and store it, or you're going
to want to short it and do

739
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,650
the opposite.

740
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,440
After Hurricane
Katrina hit, we had

741
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,750
violations from this for a
period of time, which suggested

742
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,880
that it was actually
worthwhile for you

743
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,060
to go out and build your
own storage facilities,

744
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,760
because the storage
facilities were destroyed.

745
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,520
Now it's only if you
had the technology

746
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,270
to build those storage
facilities that you

747
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,660
could actually profit from it.

748
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,160
But there are periods of time
where market dislocation can

749
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,190
occur, and the discrepancy
between futures prices and spot

750
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,240
prices--

751
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,160
that gives you
valuable information

752
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,920
about what's happening in
markets, and in some cases,

753
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,300
in non-financial contexts,
like commodities.

754
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,480
Whether there's a shortage
or whether there's a glut.

755
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,110
Weather impacts
these commodities.

756
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,910
And so by looking
at this relationship

757
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,990
you gather very
valuable information.

758
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,340
Here's another example.

759
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,110
Another example is financials.

760
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,684
I'm going to take this
example as the last one

761
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:40,100
that I want to
focus on, because I

762
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:46,940
want to now talk about how to
use this for your own purposes.

763
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,100
A financial future
is a futures contract

764
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,200
on an index like the S&P 500.

765
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,810
So there, all of those
contracts are cash settled,

766
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,270
there is no physical delivery.

767
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,890
Although, you can easily
imagine a situation where

768
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,310
you could have
physical delivery.

769
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,240
Somebody literally
delivers 500 shares

770
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,430
of stocks, 500 stocks with
a certain number of shares

771
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,140
for each, in order
to get the S&P 500.

772
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,330
But that's a pain,
and that defeats

773
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,849
the purpose of the
futures market,

774
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:22,390
which is to try to
make things simple

775
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,340
and to make it more efficient.

776
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,830
So a stock index future
is really a pure bet

777
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,770
on an underlying index.

778
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,550
And it gives you, the
investor or the hedger,

779
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,570
a way to get exposure or get out
of exposure of that underlying

780
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,950
in a very direct way.

781
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:47,395
Now in this case, there's
no real convenience yield,

782
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:50,170
but there is a
dividend that gets

783
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,670
paid by the particular
set of securities.

784
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,090
So if you're holding
the S&P 500 portfolio,

785
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,060
then you're going to be
getting paid dividends

786
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,970
for individual stocks
in that portfolio.

787
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,850
And so you'd want to factor
in in your futures arbitrage

788
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:15,560
relationship the fact that
you're getting a benefit,

789
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,850
like a convenience yield,
that you have to subtract off

790
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,830
of this relationship.

791
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,470
So you don't have
a cost of storage,

792
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,330
because this is a
financial futures,

793
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,960
but you do have a convenience
yield, in terms of a payment

794
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,492
if you held the physical
shares of the S&P 500.

795
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,200
So that's the difference
between futures.

796
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,850
Futures, you don't
get that dividend,

797
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:42,190
so you got to take that out in
order to do the calculation.

798
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:47,180
That tells you what the futures
price is relative to the spot.

799
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,430
So now if I give you an
exam question that says,

800
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,220
today's spot price
is such and such,

801
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,340
and the risk free interest
rate over the next three month

802
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,080
period is such and
such, you should

803
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,670
be able to tell me what the no
arbitrage futures price should

804
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,560
be today.

805
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,832
Or vice versa, if I told you
what the futures price is,

806
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,540
and I told you what
the interest rate is,

807
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,940
you should be able to
infer from that what

808
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,280
the spot price is going to be.

809
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:22,550
On October 19, 1987, the morning
before the New York Stock

810
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,940
Exchange opened, there
was a very big discrepancy

811
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,880
between the spot price
and the futures price.

812
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,460
That discrepancy caused
arbitrageurs to rub their hands

813
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,580
and say, oh my god, this
is Christmas coming early,

814
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,450
I'm going to take
advantage of this.

815
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,990
And so what they
ended up doing--

816
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,740
it turned out because
the relationship was

817
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,840
violated in one specific way--

818
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,880
they ended up buying the
futures and shorting the stocks.

819
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,170
That was the beginning of
the October, 1987 crash,

820
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,109
that within a day dropped
the market by about 20%.

821
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,150
Nowadays, that's no big
deal, we're used to that.

822
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,030
[LAUGHTER] But back then,
it was really something.

823
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,620
So now that you have examples
of how these prices are

824
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,115
determined, let me take this out
for a different kind of a spin.

825
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:17,240
I want to show you how you
use one of these things.

826
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:27,830
And the way I'm going to do
that is with the S&P 500.

827
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,140
What I skipped were
more numerical examples

828
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,350
that I would encourage you
to go through on your own.

829
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,330
But this is an example
that's important,

830
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,330
so I want to take you
through it carefully, make

831
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,430
sure everybody understands.

832
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,560
Suppose that you've
got $1 million

833
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,770
to invest in the stock
market, and you've

834
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,360
decided that you want to
invest it in the S&P 500.

835
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,650
You don't want to invest it in
any other individual stocks.

836
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,770
You want a broadly
diversified investment,

837
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,520
and the S&P looks like
a pretty good thing.

838
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,380
So there are several
ways of doing this,

839
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,150
I'm going to focus just on two.

840
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,380
One of them is you
could put your money

841
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,240
in 500 different stocks.

842
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,534
And you have to spend a little
bit of time figuring out

843
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:14,200
what the proportions
are, because if you

844
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,761
want to replicate the S&P, the
S&P is a value weighted index,

845
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:18,760
it's not equal weighted.

846
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,045
It's weighted by
market capitalization.

847
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:23,170
So you've got to actually
go through and figure out

848
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,870
how big each company
the S&P is, and then

849
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,910
calculate those weights.

850
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,190
And then you've got to give
this order to your broker,

851
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,360
and $1 million dollars
isn't what it used to be,

852
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,060
so I suspect that
that would generate

853
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,380
some pretty tiny trades.

854
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,600
You got 500
securities, and you've

855
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,820
got a bunch of different
odd lot trades.

856
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,260
Good luck finding
a broker that's

857
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,940
willing to do it at
a reasonable price.

858
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,760
It's a pretty long list.

859
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,630
Or you can buy a
futures contract.

860
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,330
In particular, you
can buy a contract

861
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,370
on the S&P 500 futures.

862
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,090
So I want to go through and
show you what that involves.

863
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,855
Now let's take your $1
million and let's deposit

864
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:06,050
it at the Futures
Brokerage account.

865
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,810
So the money is sitting there,
earning whatever interest they

866
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,350
pay you on that account.

867
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:16,670
Which is not much, it's probably
akin to a money market return.

868
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,540
So what you do is you want
to buy futures contracts

869
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,460
and you want to
have the equivalent

870
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:29,270
exposure of $1 million
invested in the S&P 500.

871
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,900
Now the way that the S&P
500 futures contract works,

872
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,580
is that the value of the
contract, the notional amount

873
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:43,020
of the contract, is
250 times the index.

874
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,400
Whatever the index is worth,
they just make up a number,

875
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,670
like I don't know
250, and multiply that

876
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,930
by the value of the index.

877
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:57,014
And they say that is what your
exposure is for one contract.

878
00:45:57,014 --> 00:45:57,680
So what is that?

879
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:06,050
Let's suppose the the S&P
index is now at a 1,000.

880
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,140
So the value of the futures
contract is 250 times

881
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:16,910
that and that's
going to be $250,000.

882
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,520
In order for you to have
the equivalent of $1 million

883
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,990
in the S&P, you need
four of those contracts.

884
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:30,120
Four times a notional of
250 is equal to $1 million.

885
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,230
Now what does this say?

886
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,810
This says that you
are essentially

887
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:40,440
agreeing that you're going
to buy the S&P 500 whenever

888
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,060
it settles.

889
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,820
But you're not really
buying the S&P 500,

890
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:50,130
you're buying a pure bet that
is equivalent to 250 times

891
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,700
the S&P 500.

892
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,220
So let's take a look
at what that means.

893
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,230
Suppose that the S&P index
fluctuates, bounces around,

894
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:07,740
then it turns out that you'll
see that your cash portfolio--

895
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,680
the portfolio fluctuations
if you had put $1 million

896
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,260
into the S&P directly--

897
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,440
it fluctuates in
exactly the same way

898
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,480
that your futures
portfolio fluctuate.

899
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,920
If the S&P goes down to
900, the notional value

900
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,870
of your portfolio with
four contracts is $900,000.

901
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,720
So you've actually
lost $100,000,

902
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,580
and that's going to be
deducted from your account.

903
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:41,250
If on the other hand,
the S&P goes up by 100,

904
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:47,790
then your cash portfolio
will be worth $1,100,000,

905
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,640
and your futures portfolio
will be worth the same.

906
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,660
You will now get $100,000
deposited into your account.

907
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,970
By holding this
futures contract,

908
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,860
it's as if you were actually
invested in the S&P.

909
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,830
What you're getting is
the daily fluctuations.

910
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,360
But you actually don't
own the security,

911
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,470
you simply agreed to buy this
so-called index on the maturity

912
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,220
date.

913
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,210
And by doing so, and
because that contract value

914
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,930
is so closely tied
to the S&P 500 index,

915
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,400
it moves in lockstep
with the cash portfolio.

916
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,242
Any questions about this?

917
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,572
Yeah.

918
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:36,660
AUDIENCE: Does someone
own those shares

919
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,370
behind you or it's just--

920
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,010
ANDREW LO: No.

921
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,150
AUDIENCE: --an agreement that
we're going to wait on this--

922
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:41,960
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

923
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,460
Right.

924
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,860
So you and I, we're just going
to agree, we're going to bet.

925
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,660
We're going to bet
and we're going

926
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:52,130
to agree on a particular
price for S&P 500 three months

927
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,300
from now.

928
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,170
And if it goes up, and I bought
the contract, then I win.

929
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,190
If it goes down, then you sold
the contract, then you win.

930
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,564
But it's a pure bet
between you and me.

931
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:05,589
AUDIENCE: In the
middle is the Futures--

932
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:07,380
ANDREW LO: The Futures
Clearing corporation

933
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,963
sits in the middle to make sure
that you and I don't run away.

934
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:11,944
AUDIENCE: Why do they do this?

935
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:13,235
ANDREW LO: Why do they do this?

936
00:49:13,235 --> 00:49:20,940
AUDIENCE: I mean why do they
[INAUDIBLE] days of sunlight.

937
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,650
ANDREW LO: Well, first of
all, in some cases they do.

938
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,710
So for example, you
could buy a contract

939
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:34,030
on the number of degree days
of a certain amount in Florida.

940
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,960
Now why would you
want to do that?

941
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,320
It turns out that one of
the largest crops of oranges

942
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,180
are grown in Florida.

943
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,500
And it turns out that the
output of oranges groves

944
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,590
is very closely
tied to temperature.

945
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:56,595
So if it goes up to 39
degrees or below 32 degrees,

946
00:49:56,595 --> 00:49:58,720
you can actually have very
different kind of crops.

947
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,052
And so you can bet on
that, and at some point

948
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:02,260
you can actually trade on it.

949
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,926
I don't know if you
can trade on it now,

950
00:50:03,926 --> 00:50:08,290
but there are markets for
some of the wildest things.

951
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,040
And the reason that
you have these markets

952
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,670
is because when two mutually
consenting adults have

953
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,194
opposite views and they
want to express them, then

954
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:18,860
you want to be able
to let them do that,

955
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,700
and allow them to basically
either hedge their risks,

956
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,070
or take on risks that
they're able to do.

957
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,620
So this is an example of that.

958
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,460
You're an investor.

959
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,310
You want to buy
stocks, but you don't

960
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,790
want to buy 500 little
stocks one by one.

961
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,834
You want to get the
exposure right away.

962
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,750
Now of course, there's
another way to do this,

963
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,670
you can put it in a mutual fund.

964
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,170
But the problem
with the mutual fund

965
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,980
is that it only gets priced once
a day, whereas this thing gets

966
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,460
priced every second of the day
when the futures exchange is

967
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,540
open.

968
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,600
Of course, nowadays, you can
buy an ETF, an Exchange Traded

969
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,930
Fund.

970
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,180
So that's another way
of getting exposure.

971
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,050
But the S&P futures was
around long before ETFs

972
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:04,479
and allowed people to do all
sorts of hedging transactions.

973
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,770
Now I'm going to give you a
second example that I think

974
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,311
will make it a little
bit more clear,

975
00:51:08,311 --> 00:51:12,020
and actually will answer
a question that was asked,

976
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,240
I think two lectures ago.

977
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,680
When I first started
this lecture,

978
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,450
I said that maybe a
company would only

979
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,250
want to hedge 25% of its risk.

980
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,447
And somebody asked well,
what does that mean 25%?

981
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:23,030
And I said, I'll
answer that question.

982
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,850
Well, so I'm going to
answer that question now.

983
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:30,440
So suppose now as a
different example,

984
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,880
you have a diversified
portfolio of large cap stocks

985
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,800
worth $5 million.

986
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,310
So you already own the
stocks, and it's currently

987
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,400
worth $5 million, but you
don't have any confidence

988
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,160
that the market is going
to stay where it is.

989
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,690
You think it's going to go down.

990
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,360
And so you want to
hedge some of that risk.

991
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,980
You don't want to
hedge all of it,

992
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,540
because you do have faith that
over time markets will do well,

993
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,000
but you just want
to be able to dampen

994
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,780
a little bit of the downward
spiral if it does occur.

995
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,960
So you might consider selling
25% of your portfolio.

996
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,050
Getting rid of 25% of it
and putting that in cash.

997
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,710
That's one way to do it.

998
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,160
But the problem as you
know is that it's not

999
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,390
that easy to sell
25% of 500 stocks,

1000
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,960
because you have to again, slice
the portfolio, stock by stock.

1001
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,280
You're going to have a trade
list of 500 stocks, which

1002
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,920
comprise 25% of your portfolio.

1003
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,800
So it's a pain.

1004
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,650
But here's an
easier way to do it.

1005
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:45,170
You can short sell
five S&P contracts.

1006
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,230
And I'm arguing that that
will do the exact same as

1007
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:53,530
if you just liquidated
25% of your portfolio.

1008
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:57,130
Now let's see if that's right.

1009
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,950
So let's go through
the exact same table.

1010
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,420
The cash portfolio--
let's see what

1011
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,350
happens to the cash portfolio if
the S&P goes up or down by 100

1012
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,730
points.

1013
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,610
If it goes up by 100 points,
then you've made money.

1014
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,200
You've got $5.5 million.

1015
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,510
If it goes down by a 100
points, you've lost money.

1016
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,110
You've lost to $4.5 million.

1017
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,510
Now let's see what happens
if you don't do anything

1018
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,630
with the cash portfolio,
but you simply short sell

1019
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,170
five S&P futures contracts.

1020
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,850
If you do that then obviously
if the S&P doesn't change,

1021
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,140
then nothing happens
to your portfolio.

1022
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,830
But if the S&P goes
up, then you're

1023
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,790
going to make some money.

1024
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,570
Sorry.

1025
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,670
So yeah, if the
S&P goes up, you're

1026
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,080
going to lose money in the sense
that what's going to happen

1027
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:53,500
is that your short positions
are going to cost you $125,000.

1028
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,149
How did I get $125,000?

1029
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,690
Anybody work through
the math for me?

1030
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,310
The S&P 500 goes
up by a 100 points.

1031
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:13,640
The futures price goes up
by 250 times 100 points.

1032
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,190
My position, I've got
five of these contracts,

1033
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,700
I've just lost
$25,000 per contract.

1034
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:25,460
I've got five of these
contracts, I lost $125,000.

1035
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,120
Now what about the downside?

1036
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,090
The downside if the
S&P goes down by 100,

1037
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:38,330
then the price goes
down by $25,000.

1038
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:42,110
I'm short, so I make
$25,000 per contract.

1039
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,190
I've got five contracts,
I've made $125,000.

1040
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,320
So look what happens.

1041
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,980
In this case, when
the S&P goes up,

1042
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,070
I don't make as much, because
my hedge works against me.

1043
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,490
On the other hand,
when the S&P goes down,

1044
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,030
I don't lose as much, because
the hedge is working for me.

1045
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,440
Because I've only taken
out 25% of my portfolio

1046
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:12,190
with this hedge, it's
dampening, but not eliminating

1047
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,794
that kind of fluctuation.

1048
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:15,276
Yeah?

1049
00:55:15,276 --> 00:55:17,808
AUDIENCE: I think that this
an obvious question, but why

1050
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:21,520
do you do that, versus
just putting it in cash.

1051
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,516
Because you can make the
argument that if you had 25%,

1052
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:28,241
and had it earning interest,
and so you'd still be up too.

1053
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,740
ANDREW LO: Well,
that's the argument

1054
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,614
that I gave earlier,
which is that you'd have

1055
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:34,350
to sell 25% of your portfolio.

1056
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,490
This is a way of doing it.

1057
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,450
And not only that, if
you did it this way,

1058
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,000
it would be a lot cheaper
to implement in the sense

1059
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,100
that you don't have to
do 500 transactions,

1060
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,760
you do one transaction.

1061
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,700
So the transactions
cost is a lot cheaper,

1062
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,427
and it's also easier
to keep track of.

1063
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,510
You don't have to figure
out what the price of 500

1064
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,400
securities are.

1065
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,780
You've got the price of just
one security to worry about.

1066
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,280
Yeah.

1067
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,560
AUDIENCE: And I
think also you're

1068
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,380
not losing out on
what you could've

1069
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,120
had in cash in
terms of interest,

1070
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,320
because that interest is
factored in to the futures.

1071
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,710
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1072
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,540
Remember we used that
interest equation

1073
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,850
so all the foregone
interest is in there.

1074
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:21,840
OK, so the meaning of
I want to hedge 25%

1075
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,710
means I'm going to use
the futures contract,

1076
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:31,380
so that the notional exposure
is 25% of the current value

1077
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,280
of my portfolio.

1078
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,260
So if you're Merck
pharmaceutical company that

1079
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:41,650
has a certain percentage
of their revenues

1080
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,870
in foreign denominated
currencies,

1081
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:47,950
you can hedge half of the
risk of those exchange rate

1082
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,130
fluctuations by taking half
of the revenue stream--

1083
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:54,096
let's say it's $10 billion--

1084
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:59,080
and buying or selling, depending
on which way you're going,

1085
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,190
the amount of futures
or forwards to

1086
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,737
get rid of that exposure.

1087
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:05,551
Yeah.

1088
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:10,320
AUDIENCE: In this example, we
put our million in the margin

1089
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:15,066
account, but we only
should put as much as

1090
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:15,940
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

1091
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,979
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1092
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:19,270
You don't have to put $1
million in the margin account,

1093
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,160
because typically
the margin is going

1094
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,300
to be something like
in this case 7% or 8%

1095
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,100
of the notional exposure.

1096
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,220
So you could take the rest of
that money and go to Las Vegas

1097
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,379
if you like.

1098
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:33,670
Although, some would say this
is better than Las Vegas.

1099
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,115
Yeah.

1100
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:35,656
AUDIENCE: This is
the main reason why

1101
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:37,656
we buy futures and not ETFs.

1102
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:40,360
You can leverage your
bet as much as you want.

1103
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,850
ANDREW LO: That's right with
an ETF, if you want $1 million

1104
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,350
of exposure, you got to put
$1 million into the ETF.

1105
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,170
With the futures contract,
if you want to put $1 million

1106
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,140
of exposure on, you need 7%.

1107
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,030
And the reason is
obvious, it's because

1108
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,220
of that daily mark to market.

1109
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,270
So ETFs have not killed
the futures market,

1110
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,180
but it does provide another
vehicle for retail investors

1111
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,900
who may not want the leverage,
who may not need to leverage,

1112
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,140
to not have to worry
about the leverage.

1113
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,650
This leverage-- leverage is a
scary thing, as I said before.

1114
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,370
This is the chain saw that
you don't want to be giving

1115
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,350
your eight-year-old as a toy.

1116
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:24,340
Because when prices
move quickly,

1117
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,640
you're going to have very
big swings in the underlying

1118
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,340
value of your margin account.

1119
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,170
So if you've got only
7% margin in an account,

1120
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,400
think about it, that means that
if the prices go down by 7%,

1121
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,540
you are wiped out.

1122
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,790
Your entire margin
account is gone.

1123
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,410
When futures brokers
take your money,

1124
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,480
they assume that you
know what you're doing.

1125
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,960
And so they assume that the
margin that you're putting down

1126
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,620
is margin that you
can afford to lose,

1127
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,440
and that you understand
that what you're getting

1128
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,590
is much bigger exposure
that presumably is either

1129
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,240
for speculative
purposes, in which case

1130
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,750
you won't over leverage, or for
hedging purposes, in which case

1131
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,690
you've got some other assets
that are counterbalancing

1132
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,350
these swings.

1133
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,556
Like in this case.

1134
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:13,930
You know obviously,
when you look

1135
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,440
at the fluctuations
in your positions,

1136
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,995
they are extraordinarily
big relative to the margin.

1137
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,180
Let's do a quick back of
the envelope calculation.

1138
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,920
Let me tell you what I mean.

1139
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,640
Suppose that you
put 5% margin down.

1140
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,600
You buy a contract,
put 5% margin down,

1141
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,810
and let's suppose that the
price of the futures contract

1142
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,140
drops by 2.5%.

1143
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,830
What is the rate of return
on the amount of money

1144
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:51,944
you've put down as margin, if
that's your initial investment?

1145
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:53,610
You can think about
it as an investment,

1146
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,130
because that's the only
way a futures broker will

1147
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,840
let you buy a contract.

1148
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:04,320
If you put down $100,000 and
the futures price goes down

1149
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,218
by $50,000, what's the rate
of return on your investment?

1150
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,960
Yeah, it's minus 50%,
that's a big move.

1151
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,230
That's a huge move in a day.

1152
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,960
So when you deal
with margin, you

1153
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,910
have to be
extraordinarily careful.

1154
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,730
You have to have very,
very tight risk controls.

1155
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,270
You have to understand
what the swings can be,

1156
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,900
and you have to manage that
risk very, very carefully,

1157
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,150
on an intradaily
basis in some cases,

1158
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,340
because these futures prices can
swing a lot even within a day.

1159
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,130
Any other questions?

1160
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,950
Well, that's it for
futures and forwards.

1161
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,890
You now know how to price them.

1162
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,290
You now know how to use
them for hedging purposes.

1163
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,680
And there are all
sorts of other kinds

1164
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,520
of futures and forwards--
interest rate, bond, currency,

1165
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,460
single stock futures now exist.

1166
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,405
In fact, there are even
futures contracts on the VIX,

1167
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:11,805
there's futures contracts
on electricity usage,

1168
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:15,180
there's futures contracts on
the presidential election.

1169
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,840
If you go to the Iowa Electronic
Markets, the University

1170
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,990
of Iowa, they created
a futures exchange

1171
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:24,300
that has two contracts.

1172
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,700
One that pays $1 if
McCain gets elected,

1173
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,460
and the other that pays
$1 if Obama gets elected.

1174
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,530
And by looking at
the prices, you

1175
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,830
can actually see what the folks
that are trading these futures

1176
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:39,810
contracts are thinking, in
terms of who's got the edge.

1177
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:44,230
So the futures prices contain an
enormous amount of information.

1178
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:50,060
But keep in mind the information
is only as good as you are.

1179
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,250
By you, I mean the market.

1180
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,300
If the market is
comprised of knuckleheads,

1181
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,660
the prices you get will
be knucklehead prices.

1182
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,210
If the market
contains really smart

1183
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,060
sharp sophisticated
individuals, you'll

1184
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,820
get extremely
informative prices.

1185
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,360
So prices, while they
are the best thing

1186
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,180
that we have as a
guide for the future,

1187
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,890
they're clearly not perfect.

1188
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,740
And there are periods of
time when the market prices

1189
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,690
are less perfect than others.

1190
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,540
And as I told you before,
for the next three weeks,

1191
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,060
finance theory is going to be
on vacation in the US stock

1192
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,120
market, because all
the uncertainty that

1193
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,360
has been building up over
the last several years

1194
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,060
are now focused on
the next three weeks.

1195
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,390
Markets will be swinging
back and forth pretty wildly,

1196
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,580
and it's because people
are reacting emotionally,

1197
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:45,680
not necessarily with their
full logical capabilities.

1198
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,680
That's it for
futures and forwards,

1199
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:54,860
and now what I'm going
to turn to is options.

1200
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,334
These are the last
set of securities

1201
01:02:58,334 --> 01:02:59,750
that I want to go
through with you

1202
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,275
that are not like the securities
that we've done before.

1203
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:11,605
And let me just pull up the
lecture notes for options.

1204
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,170
I want to start with a little
bit of an introduction for how

1205
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,370
to motivate options.

1206
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,970
I think most of you
know what options are.

1207
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,970
Their name is quite
apropos, because they

1208
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,840
do give you options.

1209
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,210
Futures and forwards require
you to engage in a transaction,

1210
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,490
but options don't.

1211
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,370
They give you the right,
but not the obligation.

1212
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,570
So you have the
option of not entering

1213
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:45,230
into that final transaction
at settlement date.

1214
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:47,210
I'm going to start
with some motivation,

1215
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,820
then go through some
payoff diagrams,

1216
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,190
go through options
strategies, and then I'm

1217
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:55,100
going to talk very briefly
about valuation of options.

1218
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,927
I have to talk to you
guys about Black-Scholes.

1219
01:03:57,927 --> 01:04:00,260
You can't leave MIT without
hearing about Black-Scholes.

1220
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,360
[LAUGHTER] So I've got to
do a little bit of that.

1221
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:06,080
But really the derivation is
quite a bit more sophisticated,

1222
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,920
and that's why you might
want to take 15.437 Options

1223
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,930
and Futures, where
the entire course is

1224
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,310
devoted to these instruments.

1225
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:17,880
They are that complex
and that important.

1226
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,530
So let me first describe
exactly what an option is.

1227
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:24,530
An option actually is a
specific example of something

1228
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:28,590
that you now know of more
generally as a derivative.

1229
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:31,010
A derivative security
gets its name

1230
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,710
because the value
of the security

1231
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:38,750
is derived from yet
another security.

1232
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:44,000
It's derivative, as opposed to
I guess fundamental or primary.

1233
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,250
And examples of derivatives
are warrants versus options.

1234
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,860
Options are securities
that you can

1235
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,460
think of as pure bets
between two parties.

1236
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,550
Warrants are options
that are issued

1237
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:01,070
by a company on its own shares.

1238
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:05,900
So the net supply
of options is zero,

1239
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,710
but the net supply of
warrants is not zero,

1240
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,810
it's issued by companies.

1241
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,750
And there are two
different kinds of options,

1242
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,950
calls and puts.

1243
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:19,550
A call option is
a piece of paper

1244
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,830
that says the holder
of this piece of paper

1245
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:26,930
is allowed to buy a
security on or possibly

1246
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:31,340
before a particular date,
usually called the exercise

1247
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:36,050
date or maturity date.

1248
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,920
And the difference between
being able to exercise early

1249
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,890
versus exercising at
the maturity only,

1250
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:46,640
is the difference between an
American and a European option.

1251
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,990
An American option is one where
you can exercise it early.

1252
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,890
And a European option is one
where you can only exercise it

1253
01:05:54,890 --> 01:06:00,440
on a specific date, the maturity
date or the expiration date.

1254
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,740
And puts are the
opposite of calls.

1255
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,930
Instead of giving
you the right to buy,

1256
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,510
it gives you the right
to sell or to put

1257
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,780
the stock to somebody else.

1258
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,150
And the prices at
which you get to either

1259
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:18,140
buy in the case of calls,
or sell in the case of puts,

1260
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,400
is called the strike price
or the exercise price.

1261
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,200
All right.

1262
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,820
So I'm going to define a
little bit of notation.

1263
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,890
Stock prices is S sub t.

1264
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,880
Strike price is K. Notice that K
does not have a time subscript,

1265
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,880
because it's fixed at the
time the options are issued

1266
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,580
and it doesn't change throughout
the life of that option,

1267
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,580
it's part of the contract terms.

1268
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,440
And then the call price is C,t.

1269
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,360
Put price is P,t.

1270
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,240
And the value of these
contracts at maturity

1271
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,350
is actually pretty simple.

1272
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:58,140
If today a particular stock
is trading at $60 a share,

1273
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:02,610
and you purchase an option to
buy that stock at $70 a share

1274
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:06,470
in three months, does that
piece of paper have any value?

1275
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,110
The current price is
$60, this piece of paper

1276
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:17,594
gives you the right to buy
it at $70 in three months.

1277
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:21,140
Is that worthless?

1278
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,490
Why not?

1279
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,760
The price is at $60, you
can get it at $60 today.

1280
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,510
So why would you want it at
$70 three months from now?

1281
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,760
Exactly the price may go up.

1282
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,800
The reason the piece
of paper is not worth

1283
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,040
zero today is that
there is a chance,

1284
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,980
no matter how small
you might think it is,

1285
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,250
there is still a chance that
something wonderful might

1286
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,860
happen in the next
three months, and then

1287
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,510
the price will go up to $80.

1288
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:51,300
And if it goes up to
$80, you'll be very happy

1289
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,370
that you have the
right to buy it at $70.

1290
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,930
How happy will you be?

1291
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,180
You'll be $10 per share happy.

1292
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,800
[LAUGHTER] That's what
that expression says.

1293
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:07,020
On the expiration date,
you get to buy the shares--

1294
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,220
if you're holding a call
option, you get to buy it for K

1295
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,760
dollars, but in fact the market
has determined that the price

1296
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,010
at that time is
really S,T dollars.

1297
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:22,870
So if you're holding this piece
of paper, this is your profit--

1298
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,560
S,T minus K per share.

1299
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,960
Now if it turns out that
you get to buy it for $60,

1300
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,250
and it ends up trading
at $40, well then

1301
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,649
you're not going to
exercise that right.

1302
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:39,500
You're going to let
the option expire,

1303
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,020
and when it expires
it'll be worthless

1304
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,210
if this number is negative.

1305
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,520
It can be negative of
course, but you're not

1306
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,130
obligated to buy it.

1307
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,100
On the other hand, if this
were a futures contract,

1308
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,580
you certainly are
obligated to buy it

1309
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,520
and then you'd get
a negative return.

1310
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,410
But an option is a
wonderful thing, in that

1311
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:07,069
the payoff is never negative.

1312
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:14,000
It's either zero or it's S,T
minus K. That's for a call.

1313
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,340
Now a put option, it's
exactly the reverse.

1314
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:21,140
If you get to sell the
stock, then your profit

1315
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,840
is what you get to
sell it at versus

1316
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,819
what it's really trading at.

1317
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:28,160
And so you actually
hope that it's really

1318
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,380
trading at a very low price.

1319
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,420
Because if you get to
sell it at a high price,

1320
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:36,920
but it's trading at a low price,
you profit the difference.

1321
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,960
So the payoff for a
put option is exactly

1322
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,120
the reverse, maximum
of zero and K minus S.

1323
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,895
Now, it's very important that
you understand this asymmetry,

1324
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:50,520
because that asymmetry
is going to lead

1325
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,060
to all sorts of interesting
things about these instruments.

1326
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,900
And before we go and talk
about that kind of asymmetry,

1327
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:02,050
I want to give you another
way of looking at options.

1328
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:07,110
Which is to look at options as
a kind of insurance contract,

1329
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:11,130
because actually all
insurance contracts are

1330
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:14,280
a form of an option.

1331
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,660
So let me give you an example.

1332
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:21,150
Suppose that you want to insure
the value of a particular stock

1333
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,020
that you're holding.

1334
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,210
You're holding General
Electric and it's

1335
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,910
trading at $20 a
share, and you'd

1336
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:34,760
like to make sure that it
never goes below $18 a share.

1337
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,720
You want to buy insurance that
if it goes below $18 a share,

1338
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,210
you will get paid $18 a share.

1339
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:49,520
Well, the way you do that
is you buy a put option.

1340
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,880
A put option on General
Electric where the strike

1341
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,070
price is $18 a share.

1342
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:00,310
Because if it goes
below $18 a share,

1343
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:03,370
you get to sell General
Electric for that $18.

1344
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,650
So you'll get the
$18, regardless

1345
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:10,330
of whether it goes to $10,
or $5, or who knows what.

1346
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:13,700
It turns out that the put option
is exactly like insurance,

1347
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,450
and let's take a
look and see why.

1348
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,757
These are the typical terms
of an insurance contract.

1349
01:11:19,757 --> 01:11:21,340
What's the asset
that you're insuring?

1350
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,170
General Electric.

1351
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,120
What's the current asset value?

1352
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,400
$20 a share.

1353
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,970
What's the term of the policy?

1354
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,880
How long do you
have the policy for?

1355
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,490
It's the time to maturity.

1356
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,440
What's the maximum coverage?

1357
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,150
What are you covered for?

1358
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,274
$18 a share, that's right.

1359
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:40,940
That's what you bought
the coverage for,

1360
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,330
that's what you're going
to get if it goes below.

1361
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,290
What's the deductible?

1362
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:49,760
How much could you lose
before the insurance kicks in?

1363
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,990
$2 a share, exactly.

1364
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,040
That's the deductible.

1365
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,450
And finally, what
does it cost you

1366
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,850
to buy this insurance,
what's the insurance premium?

1367
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,270
Exactly, the price of the put.

1368
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,800
That's it.

1369
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,270
Beautiful thing.

1370
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:08,510
A put option is nothing more
than an insurance contract

1371
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,850
on the value of a stock.

1372
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,310
And it's going to
turn out that a call

1373
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:18,740
option will be intimately
tied to what a put option is.

1374
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:23,630
So every call option can be
converted into a portfolio that

1375
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,340
includes a put.

1376
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:30,590
So all options you can think
of as insurance contracts,

1377
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,860
but there are a few differences.

1378
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,450
The difference
between an option is

1379
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,530
that you can exercise it early.

1380
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:41,720
So for example, for
whatever reason,

1381
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,350
if you decide that you want
to buy General Electric at $18

1382
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:48,230
a share, when it's
trading at $17.50,

1383
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,960
and you still have
one month to go.

1384
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,160
But you want to get paid that
$18 now, you can do that.

1385
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,530
You can't do that with
your car insurance, right?

1386
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,770
I guess you could, you
could ram it into a post,

1387
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,480
and I want to get
paid now, so let's--

1388
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,600
[LAUGHTER] But that's not
really considered a proper thing

1389
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,100
to do.

1390
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,600
So early exercise
is one difference.

1391
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,300
Second difference
is marketability.

1392
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,360
If at some point you don't
want the insurance anymore,

1393
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,060
you can't get rid of it and
give it to somebody else.

1394
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,350
You can't transfer your auto
insurance to your friend,

1395
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,020
if you decide you
don't need it anymore.

1396
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,650
But you can transfer the
insurance policy here.

1397
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:31,650
You can sell the
option, you can sell it.

1398
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,420
And also there
are dividends that

1399
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,090
are being paid on the stock
that you have to worry about

1400
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,840
with options, whereas with
a typical insurance contract

1401
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,060
a car doesn't necessarily
pay dividends.

1402
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:45,000
And the reason that's important
is when it pays dividends,

1403
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,240
the value goes down, and so
you have to make adjustments

1404
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,800
for that with an option.

1405
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,904
You have to protect an
option for dividend payments.

1406
01:13:52,904 --> 01:13:54,570
You don't need to do
that for insurance,

1407
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,120
because typically you don't
assume that the insurance

1408
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:03,311
value, the value of the asset
goes down that much over time.

1409
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:03,810
Yep?

1410
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,460
AUDIENCE: When they
buy the put option,

1411
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,530
they also eliminated
the chance to enjoy it,

1412
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:14,960
from the prices
are going to go up,

1413
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,410
with the futures we'd
have a higher value.

1414
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:21,390
ANDREW LO: Well, no
that's actually not true.

1415
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,070
With the put
option, it gives you

1416
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,890
the right to sell the stock.

1417
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,680
If you buy the stock
and you hold onto it,

1418
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,400
and you also buy a put,
that protects the downside.

1419
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,610
But the upside,
that's all yours.

1420
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,360
Because as the
stock goes up, what

1421
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,010
happens to the value of the put?

1422
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,690
AUDIENCE: It's going to zero.

1423
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,610
ANDREW LO: Exactly,
it stops at zero.

1424
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:52,430
So as the stock goes up, the put
doesn't have any value anymore.

1425
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,560
It becomes worthless,
worth less and less.

1426
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,170
And on the date of
expiration, if the stock

1427
01:14:57,170 --> 01:15:01,010
is way above the
value of the strike,

1428
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,380
then it expires worthless.

1429
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,100
It doesn't go negative.

1430
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,210
If it went negative, if
you had a futures position,

1431
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:12,070
then you'd be right, you've
actually capped your gains.

1432
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,400
But this doesn't.

1433
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,920
See with this you get the
best of both, or so it seems.

1434
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,360
You get the upside, but
it protects the downside.

1435
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,050
And as you all probably
know, insurance is not cheap.

1436
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,830
So it sounds good, but
you've got to pay for this.

1437
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:36,910
And so you bet that the price
of a call option or put option

1438
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:40,240
is not zero when you strike it.

1439
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,610
Unlike a futures contract
that's worthless,

1440
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,970
an option is not
worthless on day zero.

1441
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,200
It's worth a lot.

1442
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,550
For example, right now
what's really expensive--

1443
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,100
and if you want to check this,
you could take a look for fun.

1444
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,130
If you want to buy
insurance on the S&P 500--

1445
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,230
now we've had a great
rally on Monday,

1446
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:04,500
the S&P was up 1,000 points.

1447
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:08,010
If you want to buy insurance
on the S&P 500 index,

1448
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:08,980
you can do that.

1449
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,010
There are options on the index.

1450
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,040
So you might say, OK
let's say that the S&P is

1451
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,150
at 1,000 today, I would
like to buy protection

1452
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,620
that over the next
month it doesn't go down

1453
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:27,160
by more than 100 points, 10%.

1454
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,000
So what do you do?

1455
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,510
You buy a put option on the S&P
with the strike price of what?

1456
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,920
900, right.

1457
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,954
OK, for a month.

1458
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:39,120
That's what you want to buy.

1459
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,640
Go out and calculate that price.

1460
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,460
You're going to be shocked
at how expensive it is,

1461
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,860
to get that insurance
for four weeks.

1462
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,570
Four weeks, that's all.

1463
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:55,220
It's really expensive today.

1464
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,400
I think it's approximately 10
times more expensive today,

1465
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,440
than it was a year ago.

1466
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:05,740
The implied volatility is up by
at least an order of magnitude.

1467
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:10,710
So if you want that
insurance, it's available,

1468
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:11,990
but you have to pay for it.

1469
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:15,800
So the question in all of
these things is is it worth it?

1470
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,644
In order to decide
whether it's worth it,

1471
01:17:17,644 --> 01:17:18,810
you've got to do two things.

1472
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:22,100
First look into the inner
most workings of your own soul

1473
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,335
and ask how frightened
you truly are.

1474
01:17:25,335 --> 01:17:27,710
And the second thing you got
to do is look at the market.

1475
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,500
And is the market
functioning reasonably well,

1476
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:36,634
or is the market reflecting all
of these kinds of crazy fears.

1477
01:17:36,634 --> 01:17:39,050
In order for us to be able to
talk about it intelligently,

1478
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:41,510
we need a way to price it.

1479
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,702
We need the kind of
logic that I showed you

1480
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:44,660
with futures contracts.

1481
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,990
And we're going
to get that logic.

1482
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,198
I'm going to show you how
to price these things using

1483
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:51,340
a very, very simple model
that is incredibly powerful,

1484
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,340
but we're not there yet.

1485
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,310
Before we do that,
I want to make sure

1486
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,768
you understand what
these contracts

1487
01:17:54,768 --> 01:17:58,220
can do for you in terms
of changing your payoff

1488
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,911
profiles of your portfolio.

1489
01:17:59,911 --> 01:18:00,411
Yeah?

1490
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,135
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't
European option

1491
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,520
be similar to a
futures, since you have

1492
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,650
that you can only
exercise on maturity date?

1493
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,830
ANDREW LO: Well,
no, that's not what

1494
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,240
makes it similar to a futures.

1495
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,360
Because while you cannot
exercise it early,

1496
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,470
you never have to
exercise it at all.

1497
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:21,380
So a European option
gives you only one date

1498
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:24,920
where you are able to
exercise, but even on that date

1499
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,220
you never have to exercise it.

1500
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,150
With the futures
contract, you have

1501
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,010
to exercise it on that day.

1502
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,442
You've made a commitment.

1503
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:35,160
AUDIENCE: But it would have
a net present value of zero.

1504
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,950
ANDREW LO: No, no, it won't,
because still on that date

1505
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,830
you have a positive
amount of protection.

1506
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:43,480
Like the example I gave you.

1507
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,020
Let's suppose that I
bought a European S&P

1508
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,830
option for the day after
election day, Wednesday,

1509
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,860
November 3rd is it.

1510
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,150
That will have
positive value today.

1511
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:57,640
In other words,
I'm going to have

1512
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,560
to pay money in
order for you guys

1513
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,320
to sell it to me, because
you're going to be providing me

1514
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,800
with some protection that if the
wrong thing happens on Tuesday,

1515
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,154
the world is not going
to blow up on Wednesday.

1516
01:19:08,154 --> 01:19:09,820
I'm not telling you
what the wrong thing

1517
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,100
is, I'm neutral in all of this.

1518
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:16,340
But that's an example where
that insurance really has value.

1519
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,330
So you're not going to
give it to me for free,

1520
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:19,579
and I'm willing to pay for it.

1521
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,780
All right, since
we're out of time,

1522
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,570
I'm going to just leave
you with this diagram that

1523
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:30,170
shows you the difference between
a call option and a futures

1524
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,100
contract.

1525
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,380
Remember the futures contract
what that looked like--

1526
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,580
that was a straight line.

1527
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,750
Right Exactly.

1528
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,540
This is not a straight
line, this is kinked--

1529
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,610
very kinky security.

1530
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,770
And so we're going
to talk next time

1531
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,290
about how to price
kinky securities,

1532
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,570
and how to combine them,
and engage in even more

1533
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,770
kinky kinds of payoffs.

1534
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:50,620
