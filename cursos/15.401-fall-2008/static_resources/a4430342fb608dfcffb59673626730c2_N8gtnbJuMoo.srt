8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,160
ANDREW LO: OK.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,280
What I'd like to do today is
to continue where we left off

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,510
last time in talking about this
risk-reward trade-off, which

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,170
ultimately will allow us
to be able to figure out

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,310
how to calculate the proper
discount rate for any project

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,480
under the sun.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,220
Now, where we left off last time
was this equation and the one

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,240
after it.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,910
This equation we
actually derived.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,950
I showed you how to
get this equation

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,140
from this particular bullet
and the tangency line.

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,690
And today I am going to
give you names for them.

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,680
The bullet, as we've said
before, is the frontier.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,450
It's the set of
frontier portfolios.

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,910
And the upper arc
of that bullet is

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,740
called the efficient frontier.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,590
Now the tangency line
has a special name too.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,140
That tangency line is known
as the capital market line

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,220
because it represents what
all efficient capital markets

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,160
should represent in terms
of risk-reward trade-off.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,100
So if you are an efficient
portfolio manager,

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,190
you want to be on that line.

30
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,650
OK?

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,340
So the capital market
line, the equation

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,020
for that tangency
line, is given by this.

33
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,030
The expected rate of return
is equal to the risk-free rate

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,090
plus some kind of risk
premium, where the risk premium

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,800
is given by a multiple of
the market's risk premium,

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,310
or the market excess return.

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,250
And the multiple
is simply the ratio

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,420
of the riskiness of
your efficient portfolio

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,880
relative to the
market portfolio,

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,940
or the tangency portfolio.

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,650
If it's twice as
risky, you're going

42
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,040
to get twice the risk premium.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,680
If it's half as
risky, you're going

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,639
to get half the risk premium.

45
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,460
And we said last
time that, while this

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,110
is helpful and interesting
and even possibly useful,

47
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,970
it's going to be of
limited applicability

48
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,020
because not everything is
an efficient portfolio.

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,480
What we mean by an
efficient portfolio,

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,410
the intuition for what an
efficient portfolio is,

51
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,470
is a portfolio where
you cannot do better.

52
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,580
By cannot do better, I mean you
can't get less risk for that

53
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,070
same level of return, or you
can't get more expected return

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,990
for that same level of risk.

55
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,550
That's what we mean by
an efficient portfolio.

56
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,030
It's the best you can do.

57
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,440
Now, most investments are,
frankly, not efficient.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,040
If you pick an arbitrary
stock, like IBM, that's

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,510
not an efficient portfolio.

60
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,100
It doesn't mean it's no good.

61
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,970
It doesn't mean you
don't want to hold it.

62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,820
But it means that
you would never

63
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,900
want to hold just IBM because if
you mixed IBM with other stuff,

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,820
you can always do better.

65
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,070
By do better, again
I'm going to reiterate,

66
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,160
I mean you can have
higher expected return

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,630
for the same level of risk or
lower risk for the same level

68
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,540
of expected return.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,970
That's what I mean by do better.

70
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,450
So you would never want
to hold IBM just by itself

71
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,890
because you can
do better, right?

72
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,780
You can do better in getting
up to that Northwest quadrant

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,150
from the IBM point.

74
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,130
But even though IBM
is not efficient,

75
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,200
you might still want to hold it.

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,910
And more importantly,
you might still

77
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,760
want to know what the
appropriate discount

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,090
rate is for companies
that are like IBM.

79
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,800
That's what we're
going to do next.

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,660
Where I left off last time was
not the capital market line,

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,130
but this equation, which I did
not derive, but which I argued

82
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,640
comes from the
equilibrium argument

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,990
that Bill Sharpe
made 50 years ago.

84
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,440
And this really
relies on the fact

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,079
that, if markets
are in equilibrium,

86
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,660
there is a relationship
between risk

87
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,980
and expected return for
all securities, not just

88
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,900
efficient portfolios.

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,610
But any arbitrary security
has to satisfy this equation

90
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,090
if supply equals demand,
if there's an equilibrium.

91
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,580
If everybody holds the
tangency portfolio,

92
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,590
and the tangency
portfolio therefore

93
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,860
is the market portfolio,
in that situation,

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,660
this equation has to hold.

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,120
So where we left off was to
try to interpret this equation.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,510
This equation is almost
identical to the capital market

97
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,034
line.

98
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,200
There's only one difference.

99
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,910
The only difference is that
the multiplier, the thing that

100
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,520
multiplies the
market risk premium,

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,785
is not sigma p over sigma m.

102
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,420
It is beta.

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,620
And beta, we said, was the
ratio of the covariance

104
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,550
of an asset with
the market divided

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,800
by the variance of the market.

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,920
It is a measure of that
particular asset's riskiness.

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,720
It's not variance anymore,
or standard deviation,

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,990
it's something else.

109
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,140
And so I want to spend
this class talking

110
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,880
about what that something else
is and why it makes sense.

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,910
First of all, let's make sure
we understand the equation.

112
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,920
I want to do a
few special cases,

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,070
and then I'm going to take
apart this notion of beta

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,400
as being the right measure
of risk in all circumstances.

115
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,480
So the first thing I want to
do is to look at some examples.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,262
Let's take an example where
the beta is equal to 1.

117
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,260
If the beta is equal to
1, what that's saying

118
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,320
is that the covariance between
the asset and the market

119
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,570
divided by the
variance of the market,

120
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,970
that number is equal to 1.

121
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,460
If that's the case,
then it turns out

122
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,660
that the expected rate of return
of this asset with a beta of 1

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,457
is going to be just equal
to the market risk premium.

124
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,790
Or the expected return is
equal to the market's expected

125
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,410
rate of return.

126
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,807
When beta is equal to
1, the Rf's cancel out,

127
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,640
and the expected rate
of return of the asset

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,570
is equal to the expected
rate of return on the market.

129
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,520
Now, what about if the
beta is equal to 0?

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,590
If the beta is equal to 0, then
you get the risk-free rate.

131
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,010
It's important to realize
that if the beta of an asset

132
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,620
is equal to 0, it doesn't
mean that the asset has

133
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,670
no volatility.

134
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,490
In the past, when
we've looked at mixing

135
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,360
the risk-free asset,
T-bills, with the market,

136
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,990
we know that when the
risk-free asset is included,

137
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,130
you get that straight line.

138
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,150
And it's because the risk-free
asset has no covariance.

139
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,200
It has no risk at all.

140
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,050
But now, with an asset
that has a beta of 0,

141
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,850
you're getting the
risk-free return,

142
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,990
even though an asset
with a beta of 0

143
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,430
still may have some volatility.

144
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,040
It's not the risk-free asset.

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,960
It's any asset with a 0 beta.

146
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,290
The third observation
that I want to make

147
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,230
is when a beta is negative.

148
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,770
With the beta that's negative,
the expected rate of return

149
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,350
is actually less than
the risk-free rate.

150
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,260
Now that's really odd.

151
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,130
I've got an asset that is risky.

152
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,810
But just because it
has a negative beta,

153
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,360
the expected rate of return is
less than the risk-free rate.

154
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,740
That means that you are willing
to take a lower expected rate

155
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,920
of return than the risk-free
rate for an asset that

156
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,757
has this weird property
of negative beta.

157
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:55,090
And the question I want to
answer today is, why is that?

158
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,240
Why is it the case
that you might

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,540
be willing to take such
a low rate of return?

160
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,420
And actually, if the
beta is negative enough,

161
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,280
if this beta is
negative enough, it

162
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,560
could be the case that the
expected rate of return

163
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,060
is negative.

164
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,920
In other words, you might
be willing to pay somebody

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,300
for the privilege of
bearing that risk.

166
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,190
That seems completely
counterintuitive.

167
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,760
Why would you be willing
to pay to take risk?

168
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,610
You should be getting
paid to take risk, right?

169
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,690
That's the standard
hypothesis that we

170
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,700
come into the
financial markets with.

171
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,695
So yeah, Leah?

172
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,514
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

173
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:41,514
ANDREW LO: That's right.

174
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:43,789
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

175
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,810
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

176
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,070
That's exactly the intuition
for all three of these cases.

177
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,240
It turns out that the
beta, remember, has

178
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,400
this covariance term in there.

179
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,900
And it is going to
turn out that, if you

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,910
can find an asset that
is negatively correlated

181
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,050
to the tangency portfolio,
that is going to be

182
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,080
of tremendous value to you.

183
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,580
It's very, very valuable.

184
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,310
Now, OK.

185
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,280
Let me try to explain
the logic behind it.

186
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,420
And we're going to
do a few examples.

187
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,270
So let's go through the basic
logic of what's going on.

188
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,810
The tangency portfolio
plays a central role

189
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,760
in that everybody
in the world is

190
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,280
going to want to have
a portfolio that's

191
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,020
a combination of
the risk-free asset

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,360
and the tangency portfolio.

193
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,490
That's fact number one.

194
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,720
Fact number two, the tangency
portfolio is a portfolio that

195
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,300
has the aggregate measure
of the total amount of risk

196
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,140
in the economy that cannot be
diversified beyond that point.

197
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,360
In other words, in
order to get lower risk

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,730
than this particular
portfolio, you

199
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,540
have to decrease your
expected rate of return.

200
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,040
There's no way to get lower
risk and keep that same level

201
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,940
of expected return.

202
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,856
You can't go this way.

203
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:13,660
You have to go down this line.

204
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,480
OK?

205
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,610
So if you're going to
hold a portfolio of purely

206
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,970
risky securities,
then basically this

207
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,220
is the best that you can do.

208
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,380
This is the best
trade-off that you can

209
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,140
get in terms of risk-reward.

210
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,210
So right away you know
that this market portfolio

211
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,850
plays a very special role.

212
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,630
It is really the representation
of the aggregate risk

213
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,680
in the stock market.

214
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,600
And that's why it can serve as
a kind of a benchmark for what

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,042
the stock market is doing.

216
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,000
We're going to come back
to that benchmark idea

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,590
in a few minutes.

218
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,890
So, if you have a security
that is very highly

219
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,740
correlated to that
market return,

220
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,660
then that's not going
to help you in terms

221
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,690
of your own diversification.

222
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,930
If, on the other hand, you have
a security that is negatively

223
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,510
correlated with that
market portfolio,

224
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,290
that's going to help you a lot.

225
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,080
And if it's going
to help you a lot,

226
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,929
you're willing to pay for it.

227
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,220
When you're willing to pay
for it, what does that mean?

228
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,370
You drive the price today high.

229
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,230
And therefore, the
expected rate of return,

230
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,360
which is the return between
today and next period, that

231
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,690
becomes lower.

232
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,470
So an asset that
helps you hedge what

233
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,550
is essentially unhedgedgeable,
in other words, the market

234
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,504
portfolio, that can
benefit you a great deal.

235
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,920
As a result, it's
going to be very

236
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,740
hard to find negative
beta securities or assets.

237
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,470
But in any case, this
relationship really

238
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,240
tells you that, given a
particular covariance,

239
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,210
you can measure the
expected rate of return

240
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,250
that you ought to be getting.

241
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,200
And this relationship
is so important

242
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,590
that we give it a separate name.

243
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,780
It's called the security market
line, not the capital market

244
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,000
line, but the
security market line

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,290
because this applies to
every single security

246
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,960
in your entire universe.

247
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah, Dennis?

248
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,210
AUDIENCE: You say it's
hard to find something

249
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,085
with a negative beta.

250
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,082
But when you short
something, does

251
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,790
that mean you're
getting a negative beta?

252
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,090
ANDREW LO: It is.

253
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,120
You do.

254
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,250
But the problem with
shorting something

255
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,410
where you get a
negative beta, you also

256
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,470
get a negative expected
rate of return typically.

257
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,560
So what you want to
have is an asset that's

258
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,630
got a positive beta--
or negative beta,

259
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,550
but a positive expected
rate of return.

260
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,500
That's what's very rare.

261
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,870
But you can manufacture a
negative beta security very

262
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,480
easily by just shorting it.

263
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,460
The problem is that
when you short a stock,

264
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,710
you're going to also get a
very negative expected rate

265
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,364
of return.

266
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,780
And that doesn't
help you in terms

267
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,190
of producing an attractive
investment opportunity.

268
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,660
Ken, question?

269
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,160
AUDIENCE: So, what's an example
of a negative beta security?

270
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,550
ANDREW LO: Well, it's
very hard to come by.

271
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,540
But the closest thing that
exists in markets today

272
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,770
is stocks that are involved in
gold production, gold mining

273
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,970
stocks.

274
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,620
That has a beta of around 0,
but sometimes it's negative.

275
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Sometimes it's positive.

276
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,150
But it's small.

277
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,510
So that's an example, but
that's about the only example

278
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,330
that we can come up
with in the data that

279
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,520
looks slightly negative.

280
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,920
By and large, most of the betas
in the data sets are positive.

281
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,130
And they're actually
clustered around 1.

282
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,521
So the typical beta is in the
neighborhood of 0.5 to 1.5.

283
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,020
All right.

284
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,350
Now, before we start
looking at the data--

285
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,225
I'm going to show you
some data in a minute--

286
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,930
I want to take the security
market line and apply it.

287
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,130
So the security market
line I did not derive.

288
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,550
I want to make that clear.

289
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,966
And for those of you who are
interested in the derivation,

290
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,200
you can take a look at the
appendix in the Brealey,

291
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,950
Meyers, and Allen.

292
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,720
They provide the derivation.

293
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
It's a little bit messy,
but with a little bit

294
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,230
of matrix algebra you
can work through it.

295
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,720
But the implications
are extremely important,

296
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,390
so I want all of you
to know how to use it.

297
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,050
So it may look pretty
simple, but I'll

298
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,110
show you a few applications that
you might not have thought of.

299
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,970
For example, suppose this is
true for every single security.

300
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,880
Well, if it's true for
every single security,

301
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,980
it turns out that this works
for portfolios as well.

302
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,650
And let me show you why.

303
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,510
Suppose you've got
a portfolio that's

304
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,150
a weighted average
of the returns

305
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,680
for the individual
components securities.

306
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,960
Then if I calculate
the covariance

307
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,920
between the portfolio return
and the tangency portfolio,

308
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,110
or the market, the
covariance is going

309
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,590
to look like this,
which is actually

310
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,340
just going to look
like a weighted average

311
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,800
of the covariances.

312
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,060
This is a mathematical identity,
from here down to here.

313
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,360
And therefore, when
I divide both sides

314
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,170
by the variance of the market,
I get something pretty neat,

315
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,800
which is that the
beta of my portfolio--

316
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,050
where beta is defined
as the covariance

317
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,430
between the portfolio
and the market divided

318
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,190
by the variance-- the
beta of the portfolio

319
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,710
is just equal to the
weighted average of the betas

320
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,440
of my component securities.

321
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,340
That's really neat
because what that says

322
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,910
is that, when I want to measure
the risk of a collection

323
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,510
of securities, as long
as I know the betas

324
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,350
of each individual
security, I can

325
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,810
calculate a weighted
average of those betas.

326
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,800
And that is the beta
of my portfolio.

327
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,200
So if you think of beta
as a measure of risk,

328
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,570
this measure of risk
is actually linear,

329
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,330
unlike volatility,
which is not linear.

330
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,140
The variance of a
portfolio is not simply

331
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,020
equal to the sum of
the variances weighted

332
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,370
by their portfolio weights.

333
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,650
It's that complicated
expression where

334
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,500
you're adding up all of
those cross products as well.

335
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,370
So we get an enormous
simplification

336
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,960
with the security market line.

337
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,890
It says that we can measure
the risk of a portfolio using

338
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,630
this concept called beta.

339
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,090
And beta happens to
be linear in the sense

340
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,610
that, when you take
a weighted average,

341
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,590
the beta is equal to
the weighted average

342
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,160
of the individual asset betas.

343
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,910
So therefore, if you
know that the betas are

344
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,660
going to be a weighted
average, then, in fact,

345
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,020
the expected rate of
return on the portfolio

346
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,210
now is equal to
the risk-free rate

347
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:12,470
plus this weighted average beta
times the market risk premium.

348
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,800
Do you see the power of this?

349
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,730
This now allows you to
analyze the expected return

350
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,210
on anything, any
collection of assets.

351
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,940
If you know what the betas are
for the individual components,

352
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,939
you know what the betas
are for the whole thing.

353
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,560
So now you can calculate the
appropriate rate of return

354
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,260
for virtually anything.

355
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,400
And this is not just
limited to stocks.

356
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,650
You can apply this to projects.

357
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,320
For example, if you
want to know what

358
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,620
the expected rate of return
is on an oil drilling project,

359
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,720
well, measure the beta of oil
drilling stocks, use that beta,

360
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,670
and that will be
appropriate discount

361
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,260
rate for that particular
oil drilling project.

362
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,260
It's a really remarkable result.

363
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,740
So we have an expression for
the required rate of return,

364
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,560
opportunity cost of capital,
risk-adjusted discount rate,

365
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,130
for all the various different
kind of examples and cases

366
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,220
that we looked at up until now.

367
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,980
And the last point I want
to make about this equation

368
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,640
is, how do you actually
take it out for a spin?

369
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,680
How do you estimate the
expected rate of return

370
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,250
on the market and
the risk-free rate?

371
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,520
Well, that comes from the data.

372
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
That comes from the marketplace.

373
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,720
We observe it in
the marketplace.

374
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,870
And we can actually see it.

375
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,480
OK.

376
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,240
So let's do some examples, just
to make sure that we all get

377
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,790
this and know how to apply it.

378
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,880
Using returns from
1990 to 2001, we

379
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,690
estimate that Microsoft's beta
during that period of time

380
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,180
is 1.49.

381
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,090
And if you do the same
thing for Gillette,

382
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,930
you get that Gillette's
beta is 0.81.

383
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,430
Now, let's not even look
at the next set of numbers

384
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,790
for a moment, and just talk
about those two numbers, 1.49

385
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,780
and 0.81.

386
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,310
Does that make sense to you?

387
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,240
Let's think about
what that's saying.

388
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,820
1.49 says that the
covariance between Microsoft

389
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,510
and the market
portfolio is actually

390
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:20,210
a lot higher than the
variance of the market itself.

391
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,210
So let me ask you to
think about whether or not

392
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,820
adding Microsoft
to your portfolio

393
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,760
is going to make it less
risky or more risky.

394
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,790
And here's how I want
you to think about it.

395
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,550
Remember what we said
about diversification.

396
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,920
When you hold a
collection of securities,

397
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,322
what matters more, the
variances or the covariances?

398
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,352
AUDIENCE: Covariances.

399
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:43,060
ANDREW LO: Right.

400
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,590
Why are the covariances
more important?

401
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,700
What's a quick and dirty way
of arguing that the covariances

402
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,362
matter more?

403
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:55,290
AUDIENCE: Because there
are n squared minus n.

404
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,750
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

405
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,550
There are a heck of a
lot more covariances

406
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,591
than there are variances.

407
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,040
You only got n variances
to worry about,

408
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,030
but you got n squared
minus n covariances.

409
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,150
And if they all line up
in the same direction,

410
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,570
you get the subprime
crisis problem, right?

411
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,630
So covariances matter
more than variances.

412
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,980
Well, if that's the case,
then when we look at a stock

413
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,810
and think about bringing
it into our portfolio,

414
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,080
we want to ask
the question, what

415
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,070
is it doing in terms of adding
or subtracting covariances

416
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,690
to our portfolio?

417
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,850
And one way to
measure whether or not

418
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,600
it's adding or subtracting
is to ask the question, what

419
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,870
is the covariance between
Microsoft and my stock

420
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,800
holdings?

421
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,170
Now what are your
stock holdings?

422
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,750
If everybody is a
rational investor--

423
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,020
by rational I mean
you like return

424
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,700
and you don't like risk--

425
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,550
then you know you're going to
be holding the risk-free rate

426
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,690
and the market portfolio.

427
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,396
You're going to be on
that capital market line.

428
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:01,770
So if you're a
rational investor,

429
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,565
the only stock holding you
have is that mutual fund,

430
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,230
m, the tangency portfolio.

431
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,269
So therefore, the most
important thing in your mind

432
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,060
is, when you think
about buying a new stock

433
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,880
and putting into your
portfolio, is this

434
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,520
going to be highly correlated
with my market portfolio?

435
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,530
Well, that's what beta measures.

436
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,180
Beta is a relative measure that
says, OK, the total variance

437
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,390
that you're holding in
risky securities, that's

438
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,750
sigma m squared.

439
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,070
That's the variance of
the market portfolio.

440
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,200
How does Microsoft
compare to that

441
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,230
in terms of what
it will contribute,

442
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,260
in terms of its covariance
with your holding?

443
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,039
So you're holding
one mutual fund,

444
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,830
and you're thinking
about adding Microsoft.

445
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,750
The only covariance that
you should care about

446
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,700
is the covariance
between Microsoft

447
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,810
and what you're holding.

448
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,380
Well, that's what beta measures.

449
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,570
If the number is greater
than 1, what it's saying

450
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,750
is that, when you bring
Microsoft into your portfolio,

451
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,480
you're going to be
increasing the variance

452
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,470
because the covariance,
which is what we care about,

453
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,580
is greater than the variance
of what you're holding.

454
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,970
If, on the other hand,
the beta is less than 1,

455
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,120
then, presumably,
that's helping you

456
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,260
because that's lowering the
variance relative to what

457
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,280
you're holding.

458
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,550
But helping or
hurting, that only

459
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,340
can be answered
directly if you explain

460
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,130
what you're getting in terms
of the expected rate of return.

461
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,540
So looking at beta by
itself is not enough.

462
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,880
Beta is a measure of risk.

463
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,860
It measures this
covariance divided

464
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,280
by the variance, or
covariance per unit

465
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,732
variance in the marketplace.

466
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,940
But you want to know what
the expected rate of return

467
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,440
is as well.

468
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,070
That's what the security
market line gives you.

469
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,570
OK.

470
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,490
Now let's get back
to the example.

471
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,180
Microsoft is a lot more
risky than the market.

472
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,120
It's about 49% more risky
according to this measure.

473
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
On the other hand,
Gillette is actually

474
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,950
less risky than the market.

475
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,050
Now do you guys buy that?

476
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,935
Does that pass the smell test?

477
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:11,810
Does that make sense?

478
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,180
Why?

479
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,125
What's the intuition for that?

480
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:17,625
Courtney?

481
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,958
AUDIENCE: Well, people don't
necessarily need computers.

482
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:23,970
And the technology is variable,
but Gillette sells razor

483
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,949
products and deodorant, which
is kind of a staple in a lot

484
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:27,490
of people's--

485
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,281
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

486
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:28,880
That's right.

487
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,080
If you make the argument that,
from 1990 to 2001, if there

488
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,660
are economic downturns,
what's the first

489
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,840
to go, razorblades or Windows?

490
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
Thankfully Windows.

491
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,100
[LAUGHTER]

492
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,390
Nowadays, I don't know the
answer to that actually.

493
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,470
Because nowadays, we depend
so much on the internet,

494
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,210
that actually it
could be different.

495
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,680
So I haven't updated
this analysis

496
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,940
to see what the beta
is from 2001 to 2008,

497
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,170
but it could be different.

498
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,900
So now we may have
unshaven geeks

499
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,090
that, you know,
during downturns--

500
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,770
and maybe it's flipped around.

501
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,592
Eduard?

502
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,300
AUDIENCE: Could you
give us an intuition?

503
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,040
Because beta allows
us to compute

504
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,890
the appropriate return
for a certain risk.

505
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,840
ANDREW LO: Yes.

506
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,010
AUDIENCE: But what
is the intuition of,

507
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,147
how far away am I from
the efficiency portfolio?

508
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:28,380
So, how bad is this portfolio
compared to the efficient one?

509
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,450
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

510
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,401
So, that's a good question.

511
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,650
Let me go back to this
equation and take a look at it,

512
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,020
and try to provide even
more intuition for this

513
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,490
before we go on.

514
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,800
So the idea behind
this equation is

515
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
that it tells you that
this is the rate of return

516
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,570
that you should have if
you have a certain beta.

517
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,130
Now you can actually measure
the deviation from that

518
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,050
very simply by
asking the question.

519
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,066
For a portfolio manager
or an investment project

520
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,940
that yields an expected
rate of return that's

521
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,220
different from this,
that difference

522
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,260
is actually what we call alpha.

523
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,550
And alpha could be
positive or negative.

524
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,890
So when you say, how far
away are you from efficiency?

525
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,487
This gives you a direct measure
of how far away you are.

526
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,570
It's basically the difference
between the expected

527
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,760
rate of return you
have versus what

528
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,900
you're supposed to have given
the beta of the security.

529
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,740
But let me add one
more thing to that,

530
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,010
which is that beta is a measure
of a particular kind of risk

531
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,520
that a particular security has.

532
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,310
And the kind of risk,
as I said before,

533
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,410
is this covariance
between the rate

534
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,240
of return on a particular
asset and the rate of return

535
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,190
on the market portfolio.

536
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,760
This kind of risk is
not the total risk

537
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,770
of a particular security.

538
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,990
In fact, it is called
the systematic risk.

539
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,730
The systematic
risk is the portion

540
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,790
of the risk that is related
to the market portfolio.

541
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,470
So how far away you are
from efficiency really

542
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,660
depends upon how much
risk you have that is not

543
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,270
necessarily systematic risk.

544
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,504
Now, I don't expect you
to understand all of it

545
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,920
yet because I need to develop
a little bit more machinery.

546
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,720
But I'm going to get
back to that intuition

547
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,190
in just a few minutes, OK?

548
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,060
So I'm going to
give you a better

549
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,490
answer to your question than
what I just did because I'll

550
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,220
explain the difference
between systematic risk

551
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,790
and idiosyncratic risk.

552
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,780
And I think then it'll make
this completely transparent.

553
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,650
So give me another 15 minutes.

554
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,180
Yeah?

555
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,820
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that gold stocks

556
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,496
can reduce the volatility.

557
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:37,339
They may have--

558
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,630
ANDREW LO: Historically it has.

559
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

560
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,880
So there are some
currencies that

561
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,250
are indexed to gold prices.

562
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,730
So let's say you're company x.

563
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,480
If you are listed in the Dow
Jones versus this country,

564
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,930
whose currency is
indexed to gold,

565
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,080
do you expect the company
that's listed in the gold index

566
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,407
currency to have a lower beta?

567
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,490
ANDREW LO: Well, it could.

568
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,140
But on the other
hand, the question

569
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,900
is, what are they doing to
try to hedge that currency

570
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,990
exposure?

571
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,530
In other words, if they end up
hedging all of that exposure,

572
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,260
then it doesn't
matter anymore, right?

573
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,700
So it depends.

574
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,740
But the idea is that, if it
has exposure to a 0 beta asset,

575
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,770
then you will find that the
ultimate fluctuations are

576
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,830
going to have less correlation
to the market portfolio.

577
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,760
Slomi?

578
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,620
AUDIENCE: Maybe Microsoft
has a bigger beta

579
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,370
because during this
period, the 10 years,

580
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,410
Microsoft was a [? growth ?]
company, and [INAUDIBLE]..

581
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,819
So this is the reason
why it has a bigger beta.

582
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:37,360
ANDREW LO: You know,
that's possible.

583
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,700
But remember that when
we estimate the beta,

584
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,370
we're estimating it
using monthly returns.

585
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,050
And so we're measuring
the covariance

586
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,570
on a month-to-month
basis, not just the trend.

587
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,240
We're measuring fluctuations
around that trend.

588
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,710
So the trend alone won't
necessarily explain all of it.

589
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,980
It has to also be the
fluctuations are actually

590
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,570
going both up and down,
higher than the variability

591
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,540
of the market portfolio.

592
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,100
Let me continue on
with the example.

593
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,810
And we're going to come back.

594
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,435
I'm going to show
how to estimate this,

595
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,570
and then you'll develop
more intuition from it.

596
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,170
So this makes sense from
the smell test in the sense

597
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,226
that Microsoft, at least
during that period of time,

598
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:19,600
was not necessarily something
that you would expect would

599
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,610
do well in good times and bad.

600
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,000
But something like razor
blades and shaving cream

601
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,650
we need to use regardless.

602
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,020
So that sort of tells us that
these betas look about right.

603
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,600
OK.

604
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,030
If you agree with
the betas, then it

605
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,460
turns out that we can
actually calculate

606
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,070
the required rate of return
for each of these two stocks.

607
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,820
So if you assume that
the risk-free rate is 5%,

608
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,170
which is what it was
about in that period--

609
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,520
not today obviously, but back
in that period, so about 5%.

610
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
And if, historically,
the risk premium,

611
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,930
as I told you last
time, is about 6%,

612
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,810
then when you do the
calculations using the security

613
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,570
market line, you get
a very sharp answer

614
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,480
to the question, what are the
appropriate discount rates

615
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,940
or costs of capital for
these two companies?

616
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,560
The answer, for Gillette, it's
about 9.86%, for Microsoft,

617
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,620
13.94%.

618
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,329
So now if you're sitting
in these companies

619
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,870
and you're asking
the question, we're

620
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,450
going to expand our operations,
but in order to do that,

621
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,800
we have to do an NPV calculation
to see whether it's worthwhile.

622
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,937
We have to compute the expected
net present value of expansion.

623
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,770
And in order to do that,
we've got estimates

624
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,040
of what our cash flows are
going to be for our expansion,

625
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,559
but we don't know what
the cost of capital is.

626
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,850
Well here's the answer for you.

627
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,000
You've actually got hard
numbers to plug in to your NPV

628
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
calculations now.

629
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,375
Now, there are a bunch of
assumptions that we've made.

630
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,250
So we're going to have
to go back and justify

631
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,810
those assumptions each and every
time you use this technology.

632
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,400
It's not physics.

633
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,110
This is not mathematics.

634
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,930
You're applying a set of
theories and approximations

635
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,952
to a much, much more
complex reality.

636
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,410
Every time you
apply it, you've got

637
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,800
to go back and ask the
question, does it make sense?

638
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,510
Do these assumptions hold?

639
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,380
And if so, great,
go ahead and use it.

640
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,430
If not, you've got to
go back and rederive

641
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,470
some of these analytics.

642
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,220
OK, so the security
market line is now

643
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,230
a line that describes
the expected return,

644
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,880
or required rate of return,
on an asset or a project

645
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,180
as a function of the riskiness,
where the riskiness is now

646
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,640
measured by beta, not by sigma.

647
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,550
It's not variance or
standard deviation

648
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:42,510
that measures the appropriate
risk for most projects.

649
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,390
Most projects, the way
you measure their risk

650
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,900
is not by sigma.

651
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,180
It turns out that the way
you measure their risk,

652
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,410
for the purposes of calculating
the required rate of return,

653
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,010
you measure it by beta.

654
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,240
OK?

655
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,970
That's a very deep insight.

656
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,580
It changes the way
we think about risk

657
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,900
and expected rate of return.

658
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,175
It's not to say that risk,
in terms of volatility,

659
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:09,800
doesn't matter.

660
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Of course it does.

661
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,460
That is the basis of
this entire framework.

662
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,400
We started out by saying
that people don't like sigma,

663
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,350
and they do like mu.

664
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,400
They don't like variants.

665
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,320
They do like expected
rate of return.

666
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,850
That still holds.

667
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,900
But in doing so, when we derive
all of these implications, what

668
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,680
we find is that,
as an investor, you

669
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,970
don't get rewarded for taking
larger and larger amounts

670
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,000
of volatility necessarily.

671
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,260
You do get rewarded for taking
larger and larger amounts

672
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,700
of beta.

673
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,200
That's the sense in which beta
is a better measure of risk.

674
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,010
For the purposes of computing
the required rate of return,

675
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,980
beta is the right
measurement, not sigma.

676
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,120
The only cases where sigma is
the right measure of risk--

677
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,620
when I say right, I mean where
increases in sigma must imply

678
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,020
increases in the
required rate of return--

679
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,580
is when?

680
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,990
When is sigma the
right measure of risk

681
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,920
for the purposes of computing
the required rate of return?

682
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,620
For what kind of
securities or portfolios?

683
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,962
Yeah?

684
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,670
AUDIENCE: Is it for
efficient portfolios?

685
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,461
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

686
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:28,000
For efficient portfolios only.

687
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,130
Efficient portfolios meaning
these guys, meaning these guys.

688
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,600
Anything on this line, then
sigma is the right measure.

689
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,700
Sigma p over sigma m, that is
the right measure for any kind

690
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,640
of portfolio that is efficient.

691
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,760
But we know that the
typical security,

692
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,650
the typical project, the typical
division, is not efficient.

693
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,870
Efficient, again,
meaning you can get the--

694
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,660
you can't get any better
expected rate of return

695
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,320
for the same risk, or you can't
get a lower amount of risk

696
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,460
for the same expected
rate of return.

697
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,740
So for all of the inefficient
securities, portfolios,

698
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,770
or projects, you've got
to use this relationship,

699
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,690
and this relationship tells
you beta is what matters,

700
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,700
not sigma.

701
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,000
Sigma is not the same as
beta, except if you happen

702
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,910
to be an efficient portfolio.

703
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,654
OK.

704
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,070
Question-- do you
have a question?

705
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,569
No?

706
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:28,520
OK.

707
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,820
All right.

708
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,470
So here's an example of the
security market line at work.

709
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,530
And the slope of this
security market line

710
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,050
is, of course, the expected
rate of return on the market

711
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,640
minus the risk-free rate.

712
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,160
And the idea behind the
security market line

713
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,480
is that, no matter
what your beta is,

714
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,790
you've got a required
rate of return that's

715
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,740
determined by this slope.

716
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,670
And now, to answer Eduard's
question about deviations

717
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,610
and how far away you
are from efficiency

718
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,320
if you deviate from this line,
then the vertical distance

719
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,699
is the alpha of your portfolio
or project or investment

720
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,260
opportunity.

721
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,920
If markets are working
exactly the way they should,

722
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,600
then you're on this line.

723
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,900
You're always on this line.

724
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,800
And if you're Warren Buffett,
you're off of this line.

725
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,449
You've got a very
large, positive alpha.

726
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,650
So if you've got skill, if
you can forecast markets,

727
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,449
then you will do
better than this.

728
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:35,650
But what this framework tells
you is that even if you cannot

729
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,230
forecast markets, even if
you don't know what's going

730
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,900
to happen next year
to stock prices,

731
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:47,980
you should still do as well as
what this line suggests that

732
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
you can do.

733
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,480
OK?

734
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,489
On average, this line should
be achievable by everybody

735
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,190
that understands the
basics of portfolio theory.

736
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,290
Now, as I said, the
performance evaluation approach

737
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,720
to using the
security market line

738
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,760
is just a measure of
the vertical distances.

739
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,100
And it can lead to some
interesting results.

740
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,480
For example, here
are three managers.

741
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,900
All three of these managers have
a 15% expected rate of return.

742
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,130
But they have different betas.

743
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,900
And so the question
is, if you had

744
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,680
money to put into
these managers,

745
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,240
which would you choose?

746
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,010
Well, clearly you
would choose manager A

747
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,720
because the manager
is only supposed

748
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,790
to have a 6% rate of return,
but, in fact, he's offering 15

749
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,350
for that level of risk.

750
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,370
Manager B is just
basically doing

751
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,310
what you would expect the
manager should be doing.

752
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,180
And manager C is
actually underperforming.

753
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,720
Given the risk that manager
C is exposing you to,

754
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,570
manager C should be doing
much better than he is.

755
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,070
And by the way, notice that
I've said that the same--

756
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,030
all three managers have
the same volatility, 20%.

757
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,290
You can have the same volatility
but have different betas.

758
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:19,390
Betas and volatilities do not
necessarily go hand in hand.

759
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,110
There is actually a relationship
between beta and volatility.

760
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,580
We'll talk about that
in a little while.

761
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,279
But that relationship is not
nearly as straightforward

762
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,070
as you might think.

763
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,570
Ingrid?

764
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,750
AUDIENCE: Can you estimate a
future return of a mutual fund

765
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,484
by [INAUDIBLE].

766
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,400
I mean, I understand
it's the best you can do,

767
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,260
but how realistic is it?

768
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,430
ANDREW LO: Well, so it
depends on who you are.

769
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,900
If you are a typical
index fund manager,

770
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,590
you would argue that
mutual funds are basically

771
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:02,200
going to provide you with a
relatively stable expected rate

772
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,644
of return over time.

773
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:05,560
So in other words, it'll
fluctuate up and down

774
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,390
because it's got some
variance, but there

775
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,760
is a baseline expected
rate of return

776
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,620
that a mutual fund offers you.

777
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,300
And that's what
people are buying.

778
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,640
When you put your money
in an emerging market

779
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,040
equity mutual fund, you're
going to have a higher

780
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,660
return on average, on average,
than if you put your money

781
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,659
in a S&P 500 index fund.

782
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,700
Why are you going to have
a higher rate of return

783
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,270
on average?

784
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,810
Because you're going be
bearing more risk on average.

785
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,750
The only way to convince you to
put your money in an emerging

786
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,500
market fund is if it does
have that higher expected rate

787
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,660
of return on average.

788
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,190
So what you're basing these
kinds of calculations on

789
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,370
is not that I can forecast
what mutual funds are going

790
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,860
to do next year, but
rather, mutual funds

791
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,440
offer expected rate of returns
that are stable over time.

792
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,920
So what happened last year and
the year before and the year

793
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,210
before that, when you
average it all together,

794
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,300
it's about what you're going to
get over the next five years.

795
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:03,800
That's it.

796
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,580
That's the argument.

797
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,454
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

798
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:06,139
ANDREW LO: Yes.

799
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,430
We don't know-- right, exactly.

800
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,440
So there is a very large
idiosyncratic component

801
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,950
that fluctuates year
by year, and who

802
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,510
knows what that could be.

803
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,050
OK.

804
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,777
Yes?

805
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:22,685
AUDIENCE: Last
time, when you were

806
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,600
describing more [INAUDIBLE].

807
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,230
ANDREW LO: Yes.

808
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,810
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
that for more risk people

809
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,880
will expect more return,
but not necessarily

810
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,930
proportional to the--

811
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,634
so you end up having a line
that just goes up exponentially,

812
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:41,134
right?

813
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:45,060
Because you had given
the analogy that, OK,

814
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,480
now to get investors
to be in more risk,

815
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,310
to take on more risk, you have
to offer a lot more than just

816
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,050
[INAUDIBLE].

817
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,520
ANDREW LO: Well, you may.

818
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,760
But the equilibrium
theory that we've argued

819
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,050
has to hold actually says
that the risk-reward trade-off

820
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,410
is, in fact, linear for
efficient portfolios.

821
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:11,010
If it's not for efficient
portfolios, then who knows?

822
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,640
But the theory of the
capital asset pricing

823
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,830
model, or the security
market line, which

824
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,920
is what we derive-- what we
what we talked about today,

825
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,150
this says that, in
fact, it is linear.

826
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,070
So in other words, this
result, as I told you,

827
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,640
we didn't derive it,
but it's a major result

828
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,150
that shows that the relationship
between risk and expected

829
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:37,170
return, where risk is measured
by beta now, is linear.

830
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,370
This is a linear relationship.

831
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,440
So this is a major advance
that we didn't expect.

832
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,410
And, in fact, so what I showed
before was the preferences.

833
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,880
So in other words, we talked
last time about the situation

834
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,630
where, suppose that
you're an investor,

835
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,990
and I start you off
at a point like this.

836
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,570
And I ask the
question, if I want

837
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,580
you to tell me where
you're going to be such

838
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
that you're just as well off.

839
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,250
You have the same
level of utility.

840
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,270
That curve, that
indifference curve,

841
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,870
is going to look
something like this.

842
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,520
That's going to be curved.

843
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,580
That's what you're
talking about.

844
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,720
But that's the behavior
of one individual.

845
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,380
The point about the
CAPM is that if you

846
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,820
aggregate all of the individuals
together and ask the question,

847
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,120
what does the expected rate
of return and volatility

848
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,850
or expected rate of
return and beta look like?

849
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,270
How are they related?

850
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,280
In fact, it's magical that
it actually is linear.

851
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,360
So it's exactly the fact that
we didn't expect linearity.

852
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,120
Given that there are
diminishing marginal returns

853
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,930
to risk and reward, you
wouldn't expect linearity.

854
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,850
But, in fact, it drops out.

855
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:58,320
I mean, this drops out of this
tangency portfolio argument,

856
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,660
right?

857
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,410
Nothing up my sleeve,
this was an argument

858
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,460
that we all did together.

859
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,790
And we derived this curve
from first principles.

860
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,230
So this is really an
astounding result,

861
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,180
but it's even more
astonishing that you

862
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,370
get this result
for all securities,

863
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,570
not just for
efficient portfolios.

864
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,170
OK, other questions?

865
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,980
All right.

866
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,970
Let's do another example.

867
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,010
So here I want to show you how
you can use the security market

868
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,950
line, also called
the CAPM, C-A-P-M,

869
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,339
for Capital Asset Pricing Model.

870
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,880
I want to show you
how you can use it

871
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,900
to do performance attribution.

872
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,460
This is the data from
a real live hedge fund

873
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,250
manager, who will go nameless
since I don't want to get

874
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,680
sued by him for any reason.

875
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,520
Hedge fund managers are both
very wealthy, typically,

876
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,610
and also very
litigious, so you want

877
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,520
to be careful when you
talk about them in public.

878
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,960
Hedge fund XYZ had an average
annualized return of 12.5%

879
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,080
and a return standard
deviation of 5.5% from January

880
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,660
'85 to December 2002, and the
estimated beta over this period

881
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,840
was minus 0.028.

882
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,590
Now, somebody asked
about a negative beta.

883
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,540
Well here's an example
of a negative beta asset.

884
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,960
Positive expected rate
of return, negative beta.

885
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,900
So if it's got a
positive expected return

886
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,270
and a negative beta, you
know something can't exactly

887
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,840
be right because that doesn't
sound like it makes sense

888
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,440
in terms of the CAPM framework.

889
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,940
And, in fact, it doesn't.

890
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,390
It doesn't make sense.

891
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,510
Well, let's do the math.

892
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,370
The expected the
rate of return is

893
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:45,000
equal to Rf plus beta times
the market risk premium.

894
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,300
Market risk premium of
6%, risk-free rate of 5%,

895
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,430
plug that in with the
beta of minus 0.028,

896
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,730
and you get that
this manager should

897
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,940
have earned 4.83% per year.

898
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,560
That's what the manager
should have earned.

899
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,380
In fact, the manager earned
a rate of return of 12.%

900
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,040
per year.

901
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,590
So that's an alpha.

902
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,880
If you define the alpha as
what the manager did earn minus

903
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,520
what the manager
should have earned,

904
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,230
you've got an alpha of
771 basis points per year.

905
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,470
That's a humongous alpha.

906
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:31,420
Very, very big amount
of excess performance.

907
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,010
This is why people are
excited about hedge funds.

908
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,120
Now, we're not going to talk
in great detail about it

909
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,780
in this course because it goes
beyond the scope of Finance

910
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,520
401.

911
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,999
But in an investments
course, the next level

912
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,040
of sophistication would
be to take a look at this

913
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,940
and say, OK, is this
alpha really alpha,

914
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,331
or is it due to other factors,
other risks that we're not

915
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:57,830
measuring?

916
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,200
Right now the only
risk we're measuring

917
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,070
is this tangency portfolio
risk, this beta risk.

918
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,360
But maybe there are
multiple betas out there.

919
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
We're not going to talk
about it in this course,

920
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,960
but in 433 you will discuss it.

921
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,940
And it will turn out
that hedge funds actually

922
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,719
do have multiple betas.

923
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,260
So you shouldn't go out and put
all your money in hedge funds

924
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,320
right away because this
extra performance, some of it

925
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:28,207
is due to true genius and
insight and unique skill.

926
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,790
But part of it is
also due to the fact

927
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,570
that you're bearing risks that
you had no idea you're bearing.

928
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,360
And so you've got to be careful
about getting on the bandwagon

929
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,190
and saying, yeah, give
me some hedge funds.

930
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,670
I want some of this alpha.

931
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,439
Anon?

932
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:46,891
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But how do we know

933
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,210
this is good for the investor?

934
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,174
Because they could have invested
in the asset [INAUDIBLE]..

935
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:53,840
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, how do we

936
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,120
know that this is actually
good for the investor?

937
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,470
Because they could have gotten
some returns from the S&P.

938
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,210
The way we know that
is because we're

939
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:08,860
measuring the expected rate
of return relative to the S&P.

940
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,310
So in other words, the
way I got this number,

941
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,190
this is the excess
return on the S&P.

942
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,440
That's what the market
risk premium is.

943
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,790
So in fact, given the
beta of this manager,

944
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,960
it should have only
given you 4.83%

945
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,590
return relative to what the
S&P would have given you,

946
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,290
which is a 6% excess
rate of return.

947
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,820
And, in fact, what we see is
that this manager produced

948
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,450
a 12% rate of
return, or 7% above

949
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,990
and beyond what it was
supposed to have done.

950
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,796
So this takes that into account.

951
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:48,170
What it doesn't
take into account

952
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,650
is how much liquidity risk the
hedge fund manager is taking,

953
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,770
how much currency risk,
how much commodity risk,

954
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,530
and a bunch of other risks
that are not represented

955
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,060
by the tangency portfolio.

956
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,771
Megan?

957
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:05,256
AUDIENCE:
[? When you hear about ?]

958
00:46:05,256 --> 00:46:07,490
looking out for beta
dressed up as alpha,

959
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,877
it's really because there
are multiple sources of beta

960
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:12,460
that aren't getting
wrapped into that.

961
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,330
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

962
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,440
That's exactly right.

963
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,570
Recently, a lot of
institutional investors

964
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,220
have become skeptical
of hedge funds

965
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,760
because they say,
hedge funds alpha

966
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,110
is really dressed up data.

967
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,870
In other words,
hedge fund managers

968
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,820
are taking risks
that are not captured

969
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,546
by this very simple framework.

970
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:31,420
And so when you run
these kind of regressions

971
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,210
and do this analysis, you're
getting tremendous alpha,

972
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,630
but in fact, it's not all alpha.

973
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,040
There's other kinds
of betas in there.

974
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,620
And so there's a
whole literature

975
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,020
that has developed
about multiple,

976
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,020
what are called exotic,
betas or alternative betas.

977
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,750
Again, not part of the
scope of introductory

978
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,193
finance, but it is something
that's covered in investments.

979
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,950
Just another illustration of
what this hedge fund has done.

980
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,950
Take a look at the
growth of $1 invested

981
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,760
in the hedge fund over
the last 20 years,

982
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,130
and you'll see that the
blue line is the hedge fund.

983
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,270
The red line is the S&P 500.

984
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:18,224
So to your point, Anon, the
S&P 500 gave you a wild ride.

985
00:47:18,224 --> 00:47:19,890
And so for a while
you were doing better

986
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,100
than the hedge fund, but,
in fact, now this hedge fund

987
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,660
has done quite a bit better.

988
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,744
Now this ends in 2002.

989
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,410
I'll give you a little
bit of an update.

990
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,400
I don't have it
here in the graph,

991
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,420
but you can use
your imagination.

992
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,290
It turns out that up
to 2007, the blue line

993
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,030
is way ahead of the red line.

994
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,870
That's actually changed in 2008.

995
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,160
This hedge fund has done
very badly this year.

996
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,620
Of course, the S&P
has done even worse.

997
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,130
So the gap is not as
wide as it used to be.

998
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,110
There's still a gap, but the
gap is actually narrowed a bit.

999
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,060
Yeah?

1000
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] The
risk-free rate is changing.

1001
00:48:04,335 --> 00:48:07,737
The market rate
is changing, so--

1002
00:48:07,737 --> 00:48:08,320
ANDREW LO: No.

1003
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,280
In fact, everything is changing.

1004
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,931
So if you want to
take seriously change,

1005
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,430
you've basically got to figure
out how the risk-free rate is

1006
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,920
changing, the expected
rate of return is changing,

1007
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,424
and the betas actually
are also changing.

1008
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:23,590
But what I'm trying to do
with a simple illustration

1009
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,850
is use a long period and
say, over that entire period,

1010
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,270
let's average across
all of these changes.

1011
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,008
Justin?

1012
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:35,424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
If you look at the graph

1013
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:38,612
and it seems like the
differences of the graph

1014
00:48:38,612 --> 00:48:40,540
were just higher
with the market.

1015
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,660
ANDREW LO: It is, but you
don't adjust for the beta.

1016
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,460
That's the key, right?

1017
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,930
The S&P has a beta of 1.

1018
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,910
This guy, this
hedge fund manager,

1019
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,150
has a beta of 0 or
slightly negative.

1020
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,680
That's the difference.

1021
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,190
That's why looking at
volatility can be misleading.

1022
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,750
If you look at
volatility, you'd say,

1023
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,000
well, you know, obviously
the S&P has done better.

1024
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,750
But keep in mind that look
how smooth the blue line is.

1025
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:13,670
And the lesson of the
CAPM is that investors

1026
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,930
pay for smoothness, but only
a certain kind of smoothness.

1027
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,290
In other words, smoothness
means low volatility, right?

1028
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,690
The smoothest line,
of course, is T-bills.

1029
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,830
That's a straight line.

1030
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,340
That will go sort of like this.

1031
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,680
And investors are not
going to pay a lot for that

1032
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,280
because that doesn't
really help them generate

1033
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,020
expected rate of return.

1034
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,290
If you've got expected rate of
return and smoothness together,

1035
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,270
you get a really big, big alpha.

1036
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,620
And that's exactly what we see
here, an alpha of 771 basis

1037
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,120
points.

1038
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,580
Now, here I talk about
these multiple sources

1039
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,410
of systematic risk.

1040
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,630
I don't want to focus
on that for this course

1041
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,360
because, as I said, it's going
to be much more complicated

1042
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,710
and requires more machinery.

1043
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,730
But the basic
intuition is the same.

1044
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,270
Instead of just one
source of systematic risk,

1045
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,554
you may have multiple sources.

1046
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:11,720
And so therefore, you're
going to have multiple risk

1047
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,550
premia as opposed to just one.

1048
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,450
But for now, let's
not focus on that.

1049
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,310
And we're going to
focus our attention just

1050
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,289
on this simple equation, and
make sure we understand it

1051
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,330
and know how to apply it.

1052
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,690
Now, I want to go--

1053
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:32,320
I want to give you one
more intuition for why

1054
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,670
it is that beta is the
appropriate measure of risk,

1055
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:41,500
and not sigma, for arbitrary
inefficient portfolios.

1056
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,470
And the idea is
actually pretty simple.

1057
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,990
When you think of an
investment like Microsoft

1058
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:51,280
or like Gillette, you can think
of the risk of that portfolio

1059
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,270
as being--

1060
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,690
the risk of that investment
in those individual securities

1061
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,650
as having two components.

1062
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,580
So when you think of the
volatility of Gillette,

1063
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,890
you can think of the
volatility of Gillette

1064
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,730
coming from two sources.

1065
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:15,340
One source is the aggregate
risk that affects all companies.

1066
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,380
And the second source
of risk is the risk

1067
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,630
unique to Gillette,
the fact that they've

1068
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,750
got a particular manufacturing
plant in a particular location

1069
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,310
of the country, the
fact that they've

1070
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,880
got a specific set of managers
that are either good or bad,

1071
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,680
the fact that they
are subject to a very

1072
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,310
specific set of requirements
for producing their blades,

1073
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,100
who knows, but very
specific to that company.

1074
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,900
When you think about
that kind of risk,

1075
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,620
let me ask you a question from
a purely business perspective.

1076
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,790
You're the investor.

1077
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,500
I'm a representative
of Gillette.

1078
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,810
I'm trying to sell you
my company's stock.

1079
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,600
I want you to invest
in my company.

1080
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:00,850
And therefore, I have to pay you
to take the risk of Gillette.

1081
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,490
If I tell you that Gillette
has these two pieces of risk--

1082
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,380
so I'm the representative from
Gillette and I tell you that

1083
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,190
our company is subject to
economy-wide fluctuations that

1084
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:17,350
will help or hurt our business
and unique fluctuations that

1085
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,490
are specific and
special to Gillette--

1086
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:25,100
which of these two
risks are you going

1087
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,000
to be more concerned about
from your investment portfolio

1088
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,050
perspective?

1089
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,550
Rami?

1090
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,310
AUDIENCE: I think you'd
be more concerned about--

1091
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,610
as a portfolio as a whole,
you look at the economy,

1092
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,611
but I think, for this
specific purpose,

1093
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:41,710
[INAUDIBLE] you obviously
will pick Gillette-specific--

1094
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,640
ANDREW LO: OK.

1095
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,110
But I want-- you hurried
through the first point,

1096
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,180
and I want you to expand
on that a little bit.

1097
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,480
You said that if you're worried
about your portfolio, then

1098
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,190
obviously the economy-wide risk.

1099
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,162
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

1100
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:56,564
If you're worried about
the economy-wide risk,

1101
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:58,994
and for example, over the
next two, three years,

1102
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:01,157
you don't think the economy
is going to recover,

1103
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:03,900
then you're going to just
avoid that type of investment

1104
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,440
as a whole.

1105
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,790
ANDREW LO: OK.

1106
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,834
OK, fine.

1107
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:09,000
But on the other hand, you
also said something else,

1108
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,730
which is that if you're
comparing between two stocks,

1109
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,950
then what you're focusing
on is the risks that

1110
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,756
are unique to Gillette.

1111
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:20,193
AUDIENCE: You also might look at
how much the economic downturn

1112
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:22,350
would affect a
company like Gillette.

1113
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,066
ANDREW LO: Right.

1114
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,482
AUDIENCE: So if the economic
downturn, as you said before,

1115
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,815
affects Microsoft greater
than it would Gillette,

1116
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:30,689
and you suspect something
is going to happen,

1117
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,154
you'd go for Gillette.

1118
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:34,112
If, on the other hand,
you didn't suspect that,

1119
00:53:34,112 --> 00:53:35,590
you might go for--

1120
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,210
ANDREW LO: OK.

1121
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,670
But let's now talk
about the negotiations

1122
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,780
between you and me.

1123
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,160
I'm a representative
of Gillette.

1124
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,370
I'm trying to get you
to invest with us.

1125
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,330
And I've got two
sources of risk that you

1126
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:51,500
might be concerned about, market
risk or Gillette-specific risk.

1127
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,990
From your portfolio
perspective, since you just

1128
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,271
care about maximizing the
value of your portfolio,

1129
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:59,270
you're not worried about
Gillette in particular.

1130
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,290
You're not management.

1131
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,250
You're an investor.

1132
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,210
I'm management.

1133
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,410
I'm worried about Gillette.

1134
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,380
I couldn't care less about your
portfolio, I'm sorry to say.

1135
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,680
What I care about is my
company, but what you care about

1136
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,910
is your portfolio.

1137
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,340
From your portfolio
perspective, what

1138
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,030
are you going to care more
about, Gillette-specific risk

1139
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:22,495
or the macroeconomic risk that
I represent to your portfolio?

1140
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:23,950
AUDIENCE: When I'm
talking to you,

1141
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,380
I care more about
your specific risks.

1142
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,840
ANDREW LO: Well, I'm
asking a question though

1143
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,927
about your portfolio.

1144
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:31,510
What you care about
is your portfolio.

1145
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,070
I understand that when
you're talking to me,

1146
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,528
you're going to be asking me
about my company-specific risk

1147
00:54:35,528 --> 00:54:36,940
to try to get a handle on it.

1148
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,920
But is that what
you ultimately are

1149
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,151
going to be concerned about?

1150
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,150
AUDIENCE: I would be
concerned about, obviously,

1151
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,237
the macro portion of it
and how you fit into that.

1152
00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:49,109
But I'd look at
your beta and see--

1153
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:50,900
ANDREW LO: You don't
know the CAPM, though.

1154
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,460
So now you're cheating
because you now know the CAPM.

1155
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,630
But suppose you didn't.

1156
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,450
What I'm trying to get
at is the intuition,

1157
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,890
a businessman's
intuition, for what

1158
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,110
you would care
about more in terms

1159
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,810
of what I do to your portfolio.

1160
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,530
Yeah, Sema?

1161
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,362
AUDIENCE: Didn't you
say, two lectures ago,

1162
00:55:08,362 --> 00:55:11,570
that the idiosyncratic risk
is [? their survival? ?]

1163
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,305
ANDREW LO: Yes.

1164
00:55:12,305 --> 00:55:14,430
AUDIENCE: So, you care more
about systematic risk--

1165
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:14,790
ANDREW LO: Why?

1166
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,910
AUDIENCE: Because only one
[INAUDIBLE] in my portfolio.

1167
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,350
ANDREW LO: That's exactly right.

1168
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,860
The idea is that if
it's Gillette-specific

1169
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,980
risk, then by
definition, if you're

1170
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,150
holding a well-diversified
portfolio,

1171
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,760
then you're not going to care
about that because that's going

1172
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,100
to average out to nothing.

1173
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,040
Now, of course, we have
to think about the case

1174
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,260
where you're not holding
a diversified portfolio,

1175
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,390
but let me get back
to that in a minute.

1176
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,849
I'm assuming that all of you
are good business folks, which

1177
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:44,390
means that you're
going to be holding

1178
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:45,500
a diversified portfolio.

1179
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,770
You're not going to
concentrate all your bets

1180
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:52,150
on one particular kind
of investment, right?

1181
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,060
So if you are already holding
a very well-diversified

1182
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,970
portfolio, then when
you interview me

1183
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:01,960
as a potential
investment opportunity,

1184
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,870
do you really care about
the idiosyncratic risk?

1185
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,360
Because that risk is going
to be diversified away.

1186
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,760
What you care about from a
portfolio perspective is,

1187
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,250
how much am I going
to be contributing

1188
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,140
to your overall risk?

1189
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,520
And now that you know the CAPM,
you understand the logic of it.

1190
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,080
It says, you care about my beta
because my beta is a measure

1191
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,320
of the amount of risk I'm going
to be adding to your portfolio

1192
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,180
that you cannot get rid of.

1193
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,910
How do you know you
cannot get rid of it?

1194
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,840
Well, by definition it's
the market portfolio.

1195
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,950
Everybody's holding it.

1196
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,480
Nobody wants to get
rid of it completely.

1197
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,170
You're on the capital
market's line.

1198
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,910
That's the best you can do.

1199
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:47,100
So this notion of
firm-specific risk

1200
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,100
versus economy-wide
risk, that distinction

1201
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,690
is a really important one.

1202
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,190
And I'll show you the
mathematics of it in a minute,

1203
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,410
but I want to give
you the intuition.

1204
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,490
As a result, think
about this conversation

1205
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,100
happening not just for
Gillette, but for every company

1206
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,720
in the economy.

1207
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,680
If it's the case that portfolio
managers that are buying stocks

1208
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,490
only care about the systematic
risk, about the market risk,

1209
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,640
about the risk that they cannot
get rid of, and then you have

1210
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,850
to reward them for that, then
what that means is that you

1211
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:23,850
don't have to reward them
for idiosyncratic risk.

1212
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,480
Why?

1213
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,934
Because that's not risk
that you are forced to bear.

1214
00:57:26,934 --> 00:57:28,350
There's nothing
that says you have

1215
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,672
to bear idiosyncratic risk.

1216
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:32,130
How do you get rid
of idiosyncratic

1217
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,160
risk if you don't
want to bear it?

1218
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,790
Diversify.

1219
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:36,660
Exactly.

1220
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,610
Just buy 10 stocks
instead of one,

1221
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,830
and then you're diversified.

1222
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,940
20 stocks is better than 10.

1223
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,390
And mathematically,
after 50 stocks,

1224
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,040
you're basically diversified.

1225
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,600
You're done.

1226
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,190
So nobody should be holding
two or three stocks.

1227
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:58,855
Or if they do, they are bearing
risk that they need not bear.

1228
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,730
And they may want to do
it for other reasons.

1229
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:03,900
For example, as a
manager of Gillette,

1230
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,730
I believe in the company.

1231
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,530
I want to demonstrate
to my shareholders

1232
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,600
that I'm tied to
the company, so I'm

1233
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,090
going to hold a lot of my
wealth in Gillette stock.

1234
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,740
That's not well diversified.

1235
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,310
I'm holding a lot of
Gillette-specific risk.

1236
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,530
That's not a smart thing
to do from an investment

1237
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,300
point of view, but
that is a smart thing

1238
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,430
to do from a management
point of view

1239
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:28,480
because I'm tying my fate
to the fate of the company.

1240
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,130
It's definitely not a smart
thing from an investments

1241
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,330
perspective.

1242
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,100
If you're in a financial
services sector,

1243
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,096
you should not be buying
financial services stocks.

1244
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:39,720
If you're in the
pharmaceutical sector,

1245
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,090
you should not be
buying biotech stocks.

1246
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:47,220
And yet we do that for
reasons other than portfolio

1247
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,600
management.

1248
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,454
But given that I'm teaching
you about portfolio management,

1249
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:53,370
I'm not going to focus
on those other reasons.

1250
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,062
If this were an
organizational studies course,

1251
00:58:56,062 --> 00:58:57,770
you'd be getting a
different perspective.

1252
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,740
And you should get a
different perspective.

1253
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,250
But for the purposes of
building financial wealth, what

1254
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,500
you want to do is
to focus on how

1255
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,950
much the systematic component
is contributing to your risk,

1256
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,290
because the
idiosyncratic component

1257
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,970
you don't have to bear.

1258
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:12,977
Yeah?

1259
00:59:12,977 --> 00:59:15,101
AUDIENCE: So like an employee
purchase plan, where,

1260
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:15,737
if you're in financial
services, you're

1261
00:59:15,737 --> 00:59:17,153
working for a
mutual fund company,

1262
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,800
and they offer you 10%,
15% you put your salary in,

1263
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,855
and you can buy stock--

1264
00:59:20,855 --> 00:59:21,480
ANDREW LO: Yes.

1265
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,040
AUDIENCE: Would you
recommend not doing that?

1266
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,748
ANDREW LO: Well, I
recommend not doing it

1267
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:26,760
from the financial
perspective, but I

1268
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,620
may recommend doing it
from the management,

1269
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,600
or managerial
incentives, perspective.

1270
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,370
The reason that companies
do that is very simple.

1271
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,964
They're trying to suck you in.

1272
00:59:35,964 --> 00:59:38,130
They're trying to get you
to be more intimately tied

1273
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:41,670
to the company so you'll act
like an owner of the company,

1274
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,880
as opposed to an employee.

1275
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,950
And if you act
like an owner, you

1276
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,350
will engage in behavior
that is much more

1277
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,990
productive for building
the company's wealth,

1278
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,830
rather than as an employee.

1279
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,010
But from your
personal perspective,

1280
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,030
you're bearing risk
that you don't need to.

1281
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,810
So you know, the
analogy that I give--

1282
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,940
I've given before-- it
may work for some of you.

1283
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,510
It may not.

1284
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,000
Let me explain.

1285
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,300
Anybody know how much window
washers in midtown Manhattan

1286
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,877
get paid on an annual basis?

1287
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,210
You know what I'm talking about?

1288
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:19,810
These are the folks that climb
up on these two-foot catwalks

1289
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,480
that are 40 stories high,
and they wash the windows

1290
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,860
of these skyscrapers.

1291
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,079
That's a pretty risky job.

1292
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,620
Anybody know what
their annual salary

1293
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,760
is, when you annualize it?

1294
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,496
I actually decided
to find out one day.

1295
01:00:31,496 --> 01:00:33,620
I was kind of curious about
that because, you know,

1296
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,210
there's a trade-off
of risk and return.

1297
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,060
And that's really risky.

1298
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,476
You know, there was one day
when I was staying at a hotel.

1299
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:41,780
I think it was the Millennium,
and I was on the 30th floor,

1300
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,622
and it was a windy winter day.

1301
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:45,830
And, sure enough, there was
somebody there pulling up

1302
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,950
the thing, cleaning the window,
and looked happy as can be.

1303
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,420
You know, no problem.

1304
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,600
And I was thinking, boy, this
guy's taking a lot of risk,

1305
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,740
you know?

1306
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:59,070
And I hope he's
getting paid for it.

1307
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,700
And these salaries
are determined

1308
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,740
by supply and demand.

1309
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,420
What do you think it would be?

1310
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,410
Anybody have a guess?

1311
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,464
Yeah?

1312
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:06,730
AUDIENCE: About $70,000.

1313
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,860
ANDREW LO: $70,000, OK.

1314
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,500
Anybody else?

1315
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,176
Justin?

1316
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:12,170
AUDIENCE: $125,000.

1317
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,250
ANDREW LO: $125,000?

1318
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,709
[LAUGHTER]

1319
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:16,625
That's higher than some
NBA starting salaries.

1320
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:17,900
[LAUGHTER]

1321
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,710
OK.

1322
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,540
Leah?

1323
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,290
AUDIENCE: $30,000.

1324
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,081
ANDREW LO: $30,000.

1325
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,550
AUDIENCE: Do they take interns?

1326
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,620
ANDREW LO: Insurance?

1327
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,560
Interns.

1328
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,061
Interns.

1329
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:26,060
I don't know about that.

1330
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,620
[LAUGHTER]

1331
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,120
Well, so when I looked
last time, which

1332
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,610
is about four years
ago, it turns out

1333
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,300
that the typical window
washer for these skyscrapers

1334
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,430
gets paid about $60,000
a year, annual salary.

1335
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,040
$60,000.

1336
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,950
Now, you know, I
don't know whether you

1337
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,810
think that's a lot or a little.

1338
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:51,520
But, seems to me that
that compensation reflects

1339
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,220
the kind of risk that
we're talking about.

1340
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,860
And you know, you have no
educational requirements,

1341
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,450
no degrees, no certifications.

1342
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:01,510
You just show up and,
you know, up you go.

1343
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,670
Now let me ask you a question.

1344
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:07,450
Suppose that a
window washer comes

1345
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:11,560
to the job who happens
to really enjoy dancing

1346
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,404
while he washes windows.

1347
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:15,070
In particular, he
dances that, you know,

1348
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,330
the Irish jig or whatever.

1349
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,710
[LAUGHTER]

1350
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,204
You know what I'm talking about?

1351
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:20,620
You know, that
dancing, the very--

1352
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,590
and he just likes to do that
while he's washing windows

1353
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,750
on the 40th floor.

1354
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,899
You agree that that's
more risky, right?

1355
01:02:28,899 --> 01:02:30,940
Do you think that that
particular individual gets

1356
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,850
paid more than $60,000 a year?

1357
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:35,350
Why?

1358
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,821
He's taking more risk.

1359
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:38,320
Why not?

1360
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,611
Why isn't he getting paid more?

1361
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,240
Exactly.

1362
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,830
He doesn't have
to take that risk.

1363
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,780
That's not part of the job.

1364
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,420
He can choose to take
that risk, but he's not

1365
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,840
going to get compensated for
it because it's not necessary.

1366
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,960
And there are 100,000 people
behind him waiting in line

1367
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,150
to get that job that
won't necessarily

1368
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,826
need to take that risk.

1369
01:02:59,826 --> 01:03:00,522
Yeah?

1370
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:02,380
AUDIENCE: I thought
of it differently.

1371
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,006
If you had a long,
short portfolio,

1372
01:03:04,006 --> 01:03:05,380
would it be the
other way around?

1373
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,380
Because you wouldn't care
about the market risk.

1374
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,590
You can hedge that out.

1375
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,442
You're thinking only
about specific risk.

1376
01:03:10,442 --> 01:03:13,800
So like in that case, I would
short the guy who likes to jig.

1377
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,602
And I would invest in
the guy who didn't.

1378
01:03:15,602 --> 01:03:17,560
ANDREW LO: Well, that
depends on whether or not

1379
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,510
doing the Irish
jig actually makes

1380
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,580
you wash windows
better or worse,

1381
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,190
in other words, where there's
an alpha to that risk.

1382
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:26,260
It may be the case that
dancing the Irish jig

1383
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,270
actually helps you
scrape off dirt

1384
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,470
that much more effectively.

1385
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,303
In which case, you may
not want to short him

1386
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:34,240
because then he will earn a
premium in certain markets.

1387
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,177
Those with lots of pigeon
poop on the windows.

1388
01:03:37,177 --> 01:03:38,430
[LAUGHTER]

1389
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,020
So we can get into this analogy
more deeply than we should.

1390
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,190
[LAUGHTER]

1391
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,770
But the point is that, when
you think about the CAPM,

1392
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:48,560
all it's saying is that
you get what you pay for.

1393
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,150
And you pay for what you get.

1394
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,810
In other words, if there
is a certain amount of risk

1395
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:57,550
in a particular investment
that is risk that nobody

1396
01:03:57,550 --> 01:03:59,560
can get rid of easily--

1397
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,780
in other words, you
have to bear it--

1398
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,430
then you have to pay for it.

1399
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,840
Because otherwise people
aren't going to do it.

1400
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,990
However, if there's risk
in a particular company

1401
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:12,280
that you don't have to pay for,
that you don't have to take,

1402
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,030
then you don't
have to pay for it.

1403
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,810
That's all that
the CAPM is saying.

1404
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:21,370
Beta is a measure of that
hard little pellet of risk

1405
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,080
that you can't get rid of.

1406
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,920
And the variance is the
measure of the entire risk

1407
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,570
in a particular portfolio.

1408
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:34,710
The only case where variance
and beta are the same

1409
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,050
is for what kind of portfolio?

1410
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,209
An efficient portfolio.

1411
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,500
What is an efficient portfolio?

1412
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,990
It's one that is already
maximally diversified.

1413
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,330
By adding more
securities, you are not

1414
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,960
going to do any better
than that straight line.

1415
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:55,090
All of these portfolios have
been completely diversified.

1416
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,000
How do I know that?

1417
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,510
Because you're at the
tangency portfolio.

1418
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,700
There is nowhere to
go in the Northwest

1419
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,900
region off of that line.

1420
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:08,260
So for all of these securities,
the sigma and the beta

1421
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,450
are literally numerically
identical because there

1422
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,690
is no more extra risk
in the portfolio.

1423
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,540
It's been diversified away.

1424
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,190
But for Gillette, for Microsoft,
for IBM, General Motors,

1425
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,940
and Motorola, each of these
contain both beta risk

1426
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,580
and non-beta risk.

1427
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,500
The non-beta risk
is that Irish jig

1428
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,844
that you don't have to do
while you're washing windows.

1429
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,260
And you're not going to get
paid for it, I'm sorry to say.

1430
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,170
So the relationship that
you want to focus on

1431
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:39,950
is the capital asset pricing
model's security market line.

1432
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:42,200
Measure the stuff that
you're going to get paid for.

1433
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,710
And this is what you're
going to get paid for it.

1434
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,335
Yeah, Ingrid?

1435
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:50,185
AUDIENCE: When you go back
into the sort of the real world

1436
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:54,000
and include transaction
costs, how do they enter here?

1437
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,750
ANDREW LO: Well, so there
have been versions of the CAPM

1438
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,610
with transactions cost.

1439
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,150
And it turns out that it
doesn't change things too much.

1440
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:06,680
If you impose transactions
cost on all securities,

1441
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,760
and say that
there's a percentage

1442
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,790
cost for going in and
out, you can derive a net

1443
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,670
of fee transactions costs.

1444
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,040
It won't affect the
pricing necessarily.

1445
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,010
What it will affect is
the dynamics, the trading.

1446
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,620
What it will mean is that you
will rebalance your portfolios

1447
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,676
less frequently than
you otherwise might.

1448
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:25,550
But there is still going
to be a relationship

1449
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,190
between the net of
fee transactions

1450
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,940
costs of these securities.

1451
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,450
So you can actually look
at the transactions cost

1452
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:35,600
as a way to deduct the
expected rate of return

1453
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,444
from each of these securities.

1454
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:40,110
So transactions cost
is not a big issue,

1455
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,610
but there are other
issues that I'll

1456
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,662
come to that will be
a problem for this.

1457
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:47,064
AUDIENCE: Looking at this,
[INAUDIBLE] one of the best,

1458
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:50,466
efficient portfolio that I can
have is basically the index.

1459
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:53,870
If I want to allocate
my money globally,

1460
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:57,008
should I buy indexes
according to the market

1461
01:06:57,008 --> 01:06:57,970
capital of the market?

1462
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:58,765
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1463
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,026
AUDIENCE: This is the most
efficient portfolio I would--

1464
01:07:03,026 --> 01:07:04,900
ANDREW LO: Right, so
that's a great question.

1465
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,530
And we actually have a separate
course on international finance

1466
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,238
that deals just with
those kind of issues

1467
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:10,410
because they're so tricky.

1468
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,270
But I'll give you
the short answer.

1469
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:16,590
According to the theory,
this tangency portfolio

1470
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,950
is not just for the
US stock market.

1471
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:23,560
It should be for the world
stock market, everything.

1472
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,740
So this tangency
portfolio should not

1473
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,020
be the S&P 500 or
the Russell 2000,

1474
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,230
it should be the
MSCI, or EAFE, index

1475
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:35,460
that has all of the assets
in the world weighted

1476
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,490
relative to their market cap
in that particular currency

1477
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,200
of the investor that
you happen to be.

1478
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,830
So if you're a US investor,
it'll be in dollars.

1479
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:46,680
If you're a Brazilian
investor, it'll be in real.

1480
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,073
It'll be in whatever
currency you trade in.

1481
01:07:50,073 --> 01:07:54,590
But that presupposes
that there's

1482
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,960
capital market integration
throughout the world.

1483
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,910
So in other words, if I call
this the world portfolio,

1484
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,700
implicitly I'm
assuming that you're

1485
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,440
free to trade stocks in any
part of the world freely.

1486
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,809
There are no
barriers to trading.

1487
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:13,350
And we know that
that's not the case.

1488
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:14,930
There are barriers, in fact.

1489
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,569
So what that means is
that the CAPM, applied

1490
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:21,020
to international stocks, is an
approximation that may actually

1491
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:24,990
be worse than applying
it country by country

1492
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:28,220
and then looking to see
whether there are any distances

1493
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,556
or discrepancies across
those different countries.

1494
01:08:31,556 --> 01:08:33,680
But people have come up
with international versions

1495
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,939
of the CAPM.

1496
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:36,410
And they don't work very well.

1497
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,300
At least, they didn't
as of 10 years ago.

1498
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,510
Within the last 10
years, a lot has changed.

1499
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:44,000
So it could be that
capital market integration

1500
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,029
has made the world
CAPM look a lot better

1501
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:49,237
in terms of the data.

1502
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:50,649
OK.

1503
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:54,221
Other questions?

1504
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:54,720
All right.

1505
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:59,580
So now I'm going to talk
about implementing it.

1506
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,920
And we're going to deal
with all of the messy issues

1507
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,250
that I tried to put
off a lecture ago.

1508
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,340
How do you take this
thing out for a spin?

1509
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,189
Well, one thing you
could do is to try

1510
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:13,200
to test the CAPM
to see if it works.

1511
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,740
And one way to test it
is to ask the question,

1512
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:20,180
if we assume that all
securities are priced according

1513
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:25,479
to this equation, then another
way to write the equation that

1514
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:28,540
doesn't rely on expected
returns, but relies

1515
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:33,130
on realized returns, is to write
it as a regression equation,

1516
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,710
as you did in DMD.

1517
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,670
The regression equation is the
return, the actual realized

1518
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:45,640
return on security i, is
given by the risk-free rate

1519
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,510
plus beta times the realized
return on the market

1520
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:54,149
minus the risk-free
rate plus epsilon.

1521
01:09:54,149 --> 01:10:01,380
Epsilon is the error term,
the disturbance, the residual,

1522
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,230
that is giving you
the fluctuations

1523
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,700
around the expected value.

1524
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,690
So when we remove the expected
values from this equation,

1525
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:12,120
we have to stick in
this epsilon term that

1526
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,290
sort of bounces around.

1527
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,960
By the way, when you
look at this equation,

1528
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,690
you now have an
explicit representation

1529
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:27,990
for systematic risk
and idiosyncratic risk.

1530
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,960
For a given return,
it's comprised

1531
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,480
of three pieces, the risk-free
rate, beta times the market

1532
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,050
return that bounces around, and
this epsilon is the Irish jig.

1533
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,890
That is the idiosyncratic
bouncing around

1534
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,491
that you don't get
any reward for.

1535
01:10:47,491 --> 01:10:49,490
How do you know you don't
get any reward for it?

1536
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,570
Because on average, the expected
value of this is equal to 0.

1537
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:54,680
How do I know that?

1538
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,550
By definition that's how I got
from this equation down here.

1539
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:01,250
If you take the expected
value of this equation,

1540
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,560
the only way that the
expected value of this

1541
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,480
gives you this
equation on the top

1542
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,240
is if that epsilon has a 0 mean.

1543
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:13,520
So you don't get paid
for bearing epsilon risk.

1544
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,480
It's there.

1545
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,582
And for some stocks it's huge.

1546
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:20,290
But you don't get paid
for it because you

1547
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,520
don't have to bear it.

1548
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,750
And the reason you
don't have to bear it

1549
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,220
is, if you take
50 of these stocks

1550
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,400
and stick them in a portfolio,
the epsilons average out to 0.

1551
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,730
How do I know that?

1552
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,650
Well, this relies on
a piece of mathematics

1553
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,470
that's known as the
law of large numbers.

1554
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,160
You may have heard that term
used in casual conversation,

1555
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,750
but it's actually
a real theorem.

1556
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,670
What it says is that
when you have large,

1557
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,730
large numbers of
fluctuations that are not

1558
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,890
correlated with each other--

1559
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,680
and by definition,
idiosyncratic risks

1560
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,349
for Gillette and Microsoft
and other companies

1561
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,390
are not correlated because
they're idiosyncratic.

1562
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,131
They're unique to those firms.

1563
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:57,380
That when you get a large
number of these uncorrelated

1564
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:01,970
fluctuations, that in the
limit, they actually go to 0.

1565
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:04,250
You can disregard them.

1566
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,140
So the law of large
numbers is what

1567
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,380
tells you that this
idiosyncratic risk is not

1568
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,380
going to be something
you will get paid for.

1569
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:18,050
So this is the CAPM
relationship using actual data.

1570
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:23,420
And if we stick in an alpha term
to represent deviations from

1571
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,480
the CAPM, and I subtract the
risk-free rate from both sides,

1572
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,030
just to have everything
in excess returns,

1573
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:35,960
then the CAPM reduces to the
hypothesis that the alpha--

1574
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,680
across all stocks, all
managers, all projects,

1575
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,190
the alpha is equal to 0.

1576
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:44,662
That's what the CAPM says.

1577
01:12:44,662 --> 01:12:48,380
And if you want to
formulate it strictly

1578
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,410
in terms of total
rates of return,

1579
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,560
it says that the alpha has to
be equal to the risk-free rate

1580
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,800
times 1 minus beta.

1581
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,920
This is a different
alpha than this alpha.

1582
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,290
This alpha represents the
excess rate of return.

1583
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,290
OK, so let's do it.

1584
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,700
Let's see whether
or not it's true.

1585
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,600
Let's take a bunch of stocks,
subtract the risk-free rate

1586
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,510
from the stock returns, run
a regression of that stock's

1587
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:21,660
return on a constant and
the market excess return,

1588
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:24,940
and let's see whether the
intercept is equal to 0.

1589
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:32,760
Well, if you do this for two
stocks, Biogen and Motorola--

1590
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:40,940
I've done this from
1988 to I think 2006.

1591
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,210
When you run that regression,
here's what you get.

1592
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:54,130
For Biogen, the beta is
1.43, the intercept 1.61%,

1593
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,850
and the standard error is 1.1%.

1594
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:02,440
And then Rf times 1
minus beta is minus 2.1%.

1595
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:08,020
This should be equal to the
alpha in that previous equation

1596
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,180
that I gave you.

1597
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:15,280
So in other words, the alpha
that we've estimated for Biogen

1598
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,640
using this CAPM
regression is 3.7%,

1599
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:24,940
or on a monthly basis 45% alpha.

1600
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,620
Biogen is an incredibly good
buy according to the CAPM,

1601
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,330
if you believe the CAPM.

1602
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,700
All right.

1603
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,760
Now that's Biogen.
What about Motorola?

1604
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,040
During the same period,
when you estimate Motorola,

1605
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,500
it's got a beta of 1.42.

1606
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,630
And we're estimating an alpha
not quite as big, but 23.5%

1607
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,550
percent on an annualized basis.

1608
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:50,560
That's still pretty big.

1609
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,310
So if you run this
regression and analyze it,

1610
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:58,120
this is what you would
conclude, that these two stocks

1611
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,410
are wonderful buys.

1612
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:02,260
What we're going to
talk about next time

1613
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,990
is whether this interpretation
really makes sense,

1614
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,076
or whether we've got
some missing factors,

1615
01:15:07,076 --> 01:15:08,950
or whether we're measuring
things improperly.

1616
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,700
We're going to need
to do a bit more work.

1617
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,180
But we're very close to
being able to figure out

1618
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,340
exactly how all of
these pricing models

1619
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,360
work in tandem with the kinds
of risk budgeting calculations

1620
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,100
that we're going to need to
do for the rest of the course.

1621
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,120
So I'll see you on Monday.
