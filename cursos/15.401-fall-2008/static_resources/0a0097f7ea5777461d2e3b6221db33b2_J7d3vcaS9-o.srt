8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,520
ANDREW LO: Well, if you remember
last time where we left off,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,270
we were talking about
risk and return.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,340
And we said that we
were going to make

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,759
the following simplifying
assumption, which

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,230
is that we're going to
assume that investors

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,630
like expected return,
and they do not like risk

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,970
as measured by volatility.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,020
All right?

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,920
And so the way that we
depict it graphically

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,150
is to use a graph
where the x-axis is

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,770
standard deviation of
your entire portfolio,

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,600
and the y-axis is the expected
return of that portfolio.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,030
And the question is,
where on this graph

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,720
can we get to, given the
securities that we have access

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,790
to, that will maximize
our level of happiness.

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,960
Where happiness,
again, is assumed

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,550
to mean higher expected rate
of return and lower risk,

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,860
as measured by variance
or standard deviation.

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,940
So for example, if you take
a look at this simple graph

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,400
and you ask the question, where
on the graph do you want to be,

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,940
you would like to
be always going

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,050
in the northwest direction.

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,550
Right?

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,210
Because north means higher
expected return and west

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,120
means lower risk.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,040
So obviously, if we could,
we'd love to be on this axis

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,420
all the way, way up.

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,130
Right?

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,970
No risk, lots of return.

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,040
That's an example
of an arbitrage.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,050
And we know that
that can't happen

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,300
very easily because otherwise
everybody would be there.

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,740
And pretty soon it would
wipe out that opportunity.

41
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,370
So the question from the
portfolio construction

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,300
perspective is now a little bit
sharper than it was last week

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,200
when we started down this path.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,250
Now we want to
construct a portfolio,

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,090
we want to take a
collection of securities

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,550
and weight them in order
to be as happy as possible.

47
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,840
Meaning, we want to be
as northwest as possible.

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,050
So let's see how we
go about doing that.

49
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,570
One thing we could do is just
pick an individual stock.

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,160
So if you have these four
stocks to pick from, then

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,950
to go as northwest
as possible, you're

52
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,760
sort of looking at Merck
as, you know, the extreme.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
But it's not at all clear
whether or not that's something

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
that you really want.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,840
Because, for example,
General Motors,

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,400
while it has a lower expected
return than Merck, it does

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
have a bit of a lower risk.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,310
And for some people, that
might actually be preferred.

59
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,550
So at this point, we don't have
a lot of hard recommendations

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,780
to provide you with, without
any further analysis.

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,120
So we're going to do some
further analysis today.

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,900
And the analysis is to ask
the question, all right, what

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,330
are the properties of mean and
variance for a given portfolio,

64
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,620
not just for an
individual security.

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,440
So it turns out that there's a
relatively straightforward way

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,410
of answering this.

67
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,260
And let me just go
through the calculations

68
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,090
and then we can see
what that implies

69
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,770
for where we want to be in that
mean-standard deviation graph.

70
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,680
So the mean of a
particular stock I'm

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,910
going to write as expectation
of Ri, or mu i, for short.

72
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,760
The variance of a
particular stock

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm going to write
as sigma squared i,

74
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,970
or the standard deviation
is then just sigma i.

75
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,320
OK?

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,430
And it turns out, you
can show this rigorously.

77
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,860
I won't do that, but you
can take a look at that

78
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,750
if you are unconvinced.

79
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,260
It turns out that if you
construct a weighted average

80
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,310
of stocks so that the
return of the portfolio

81
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,940
is given by that
top line, R sub p,

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,170
then when you take the expected
value of that top line, what

83
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,390
you get is the middle line.

84
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,360
In other words, the expected
return of a portfolio

85
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,450
is just equal to the exact
same weighted averages

86
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,600
of the expected rates of return
of the individual components.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,140
So you understand the
difference between the second

88
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,180
and the first line
in that red box?

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,230
That's a very
important distinction.

90
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,360
The top line is basically
an accounting identity.

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,540
It says that when you want to
compute the actual realized

92
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,640
return in your
portfolio, you just

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,460
take a weighted average of what
you did on each stock, what

94
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,920
your return is on each stock.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,210
That's an accounting identity.

96
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,480
The second line is not
an accounting identity.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,070
It comes from an
accounting identity.

98
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,050
But what it says
is that on average,

99
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,780
the rate of return
of your portfolio

100
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,060
is equal to a weighted average
of the average rates of return

101
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,890
on each of the components
of your portfolio.

102
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,390
OK?

103
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,580
That's a very
important principle.

104
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,100
Any questions about
that before we move on?

105
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,600
OK.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,250
So I'm going to write that as a
shorthand for the portfolio, mu

107
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,270
sub p.

108
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,560
So mu sub p is just equal
to this whole expression

109
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,180
right here.

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,720
All right.

111
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,210
So what we've now deduced is
that the mean of my portfolio

112
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,150
is simply the weighted
average of the means of each

113
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,660
of the securities
in the portfolio.

114
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,060
What I'm going to turn to next
is a much more complicated

115
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,060
calculation, which is, what is
the variance of my portfolio.

116
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,040
It turns out that the
variance of the portfolio

117
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,060
is not a simple weighted
average of the variances

118
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,510
of my individual securities.

119
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,940
This is where it
gets complicated,

120
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,460
and also where it gets really
interesting and valuable

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,391
from the investor's perspective.

122
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:22,890
OK.

123
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,220
Let's do the calculation.

124
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,220
You're going to have to dredge
up your old DMD knowledge here

125
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,560
of how to compute variances
of sums of random variables.

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,230
The variance of my
portfolio return, R sub p,

127
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,430
is simply equal to the expected
value of the excess return

128
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,450
of that portfolio, in
excess of its mean,

129
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,760
right, squared, and then
take the expectation of that.

130
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,660
And remember that the
return of the portfolio

131
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,520
is just a weighted
average of the returns

132
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,050
of the individual securities.

133
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,470
And the mean of the portfolio is
just the same weighted average

134
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,510
of the means of the securities.

135
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,690
So when you plug those
relationships in, what you get

136
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,060
is that the variance is
simply equal to the expected

137
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,781
value of the square of
this long weighted average.

138
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,905
So you've got a weighted
average, a bunch of terms,

139
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:15,840
right?

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,340
And then you square
that and then

141
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,540
you take the expected value.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,680
Well, if you've got n terms
in that weighted average,

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,379
and you square that n
terms, how many terms

144
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,420
comes out of that square?

145
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,490
Anybody?

146
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,910
n terms, and you
square those n terms,

147
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,290
so those n terms
multiplied by itself,

148
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,660
how many terms do you
get when you do that?

149
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,160
Yeah?

150
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,740
ANDREW LO: Well, why
not just n squared?

152
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,900
You're thinking about the
unique elements, maybe,

153
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,830
the off diagonal.

154
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,690
I'm talking about all of them.

155
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,100
So with n terms,
when you square it,

156
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,870
n terms multiplied by n terms,
you get n times n terms,

157
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,710
n squared terms.

158
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,130
And so these n squared
terms all look like this.

159
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,290
They all look like
omega i times omega

160
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,180
j multiplied by the
excess return of i

161
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,920
times the excess return of j.

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,190
Sometimes i equals j.

163
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,450
And when that happens,
you get omega i squared

164
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,049
times the variance
of security i.

165
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,169
But when i does not
equal to j, then you're

166
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,059
going to get omega i times
omega j times the covariance

167
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,960
between the return on i and j.

168
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,020
And another way of
writing that covariance

169
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,840
is equal to the
correlation between i

170
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,940
and j multiplied by the
standard deviation of i

171
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,410
and the standard deviation of j.

172
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,762
The point is that when we look
at the variance of a portfolio,

173
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,470
it's not just the
simple weighted average

174
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,290
of the variances of
the component stocks.

175
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,150
It's actually a weighted average
of all the cross products,

176
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:20,140
where the weights are also the
cross products of the weights.

177
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,380
So it's these.

178
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,567
It's all of these.

179
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,900
And how many of these are there?

180
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,240
Well, i goes from 1 to n, j
goes from 1 to n, n times n,

181
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,500
you get n squared of these.

182
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,840
So this actually has
a nice representation.

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,130
It actually comes
out of a table.

184
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,880
Right?

185
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,260
So you can think of all of the
portfolio weights multiplied

186
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,990
by the excess returns
on one dimension

187
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,340
of the table, the columns,
and the exact same entries

188
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,480
in the rows.

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,290
You've got n columns,
n rows, n times n,

190
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,650
or n squared
elements that make up

191
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,620
the variance of your portfolio.

192
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,280
So this is where it
gets really complicated.

193
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,530
But this is why we have
computers and spreadsheets

194
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,550
and things like that.

195
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,200
So in order to figure out the
variance of your portfolio,

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
you've got to basically add all
of the elements in this table.

197
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,690
You've got n squared
things to add up

198
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,740
to get the variance
of your portfolio.

199
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,830
And the insight of
modern finance theory--

200
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,310
the reason that Harry
Markowitz won the Nobel Prize

201
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,890
in economics for this idea--

202
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,810
is that when you add up all
of these different elements,

203
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,110
you can get results that
are very different from just

204
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,390
looking at one or two stocks.

205
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,700
Because, in
particular, there are

206
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,970
some cases where
these cross products

207
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,190
are either small or
maybe even negative.

208
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,890
And in that case,
it actually helps

209
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:58,590
you to reduce the overall
riskiness of your portfolio.

210
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,180
This is the intuition.

211
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,700
This is the
mathematics underlying,

212
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,890
don't put all your
eggs in one basket.

213
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,040
When you don't put all your
eggs in one basket, what you're

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,320
getting, what you're
benefiting from,

215
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,410
are these cross
products that can either

216
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,110
be small or negative,
and will ultimately

217
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,702
reduce the fluctuations
of your portfolio.

218
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,160
Another way of thinking about
it is that some stocks go up,

219
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,550
some stocks go down.

220
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,380
And if they don't go up and
down in the exact same way,

221
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,010
if they are unrelated
or less related,

222
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,460
then when you put it all
together in a portfolio

223
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,880
it dampens the riskiness
of your overall holdings.

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,100
OK.

225
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,520
So there are n squared
elements that you

226
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,360
have to add up in order to
get the portfolio variance.

227
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,140
It's literally the sum of all
of the entries in this table.

228
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,280
And the point of the
next few bullet points

229
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,430
is that there are a
lot more covariances

230
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,920
than there are variances.

231
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,680
The variances are along the
diagonal of that table, right?

232
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,930
That's the variance
of the first stock,

233
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,533
the variance of the
second stock, dot,

234
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,530
dot, dot, the variance
of the n stock.

235
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,210
Those are how volatile
the individual stocks are.

236
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,640
But there are only n of those.

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,690
There are n squared minus
n of the other stuff.

238
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,955
That's where you were thinking
about n minus 1, right?

239
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:32,520
It's n squared minus n,
or n times n minus 1.

240
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,100
Other non-diagonal entries.

241
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,940
So what this suggests is that
the covariances are a lot more

242
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,470
important in determining the
riskiness of your portfolio

243
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,180
than the riskiness of
the individual stocks.

244
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,600
You know, Intel looks
like a scary stock

245
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,280
because it's really volatile.

246
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,702
But when you've got n
Intels in your portfolio,

247
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:55,410
even though each of
the individual stocks

248
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,900
is scary, what you have
to keep your eye on

249
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,180
is how they are correlated.

250
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,840
Because the correlations
in a portfolio of n

251
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,450
stocks is actually
more important

252
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,010
than the individual variances.

253
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,830
The individual variances
matter, but they

254
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,860
don't matter nearly as
much as the covariances.

255
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,000
OK?

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,950
So now I'm going
to do an example.

257
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,150
It's hard to get intuition
for n by n matrices,

258
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,110
unless you're Rain Man,
or some incredible genius.

259
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,760
The way that I think about this
is, let's look at two assets.

260
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,260
OK?

261
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,110
If I can understand two assets,
I can sort generalize and think

262
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,460
about n assets.

263
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,930
So I gave you the
general result just

264
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,820
to tell you that this
is how you do it.

265
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,400
But now to understand
it, really,

266
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,220
let's focus just on two assets.

267
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,640
OK?

268
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,160
Suppose we only have
two stocks, a and b.

269
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,140
And I'm going to calculate the
expected return and standard

270
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,080
deviation of a portfolio
with just those two stocks.

271
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,730
So the portfolio
weights are going

272
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,020
to be omega a for stock a,
and omega b for stock b.

273
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,357
And omega a plus
omega b adds up to 1.

274
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,440
So just keep that in mind.

275
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,990
I don't put it
there just because I

276
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,895
want to save a little
space on the slide.

277
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,770
But these are the weights
for the two stocks.

278
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,660
And those are the only
two things you hold.

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,070
All right?

280
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,660
The expected value
is as we said.

281
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,910
It's a weighted average
of your holdings of

282
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,350
and b, right, multiplied by the
mean of a and the mean of b.

283
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,120
Now the variance, the variance
of these two securities

284
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,430
when they are put
into a portfolio

285
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,370
is going to be simply
omega a squared

286
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,820
times the variance
of a plus omega

287
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,990
b squared times
the variance of b.

288
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,540
And now you only have
one cross product

289
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,760
to worry about because
you've only got two stocks.

290
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,540
Right?

291
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,250
And that is 2 times
omega a times omega

292
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,580
b times the covariance
between a and b.

293
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Now you can do this in a 2
by 2 table, just like the n

294
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,670
by n table.

295
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,190
And with a 2 by
2 table, you know

296
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,070
that you've got two diagonal
elements and two off

297
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,450
diagonal elements.

298
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,380
And that's where you get
that number 2 for the 2 times

299
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,950
omega a, omega b
times the covariance.

300
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,150
OK?

301
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,910
And I rewrite it in
terms of correlations

302
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,131
because it's easier to think
in terms of correlations.

303
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:13,630
Why?

304
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,004
Because correlations
we know have

305
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,950
to be between minus 1 and 1.

306
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,170
And so if I tell you a stock
has a correlation with another

307
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,260
of 30%, you can actually
get your arms around that.

308
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,831
You can get intuition for that.

309
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,330
All right?

310
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,310
So it's a little
easier to interpret.

311
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,440
But either way is fine.

312
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,620
So we now have an
expression for the mean

313
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,500
and the variance of a
portfolio of two assets.

314
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,630
Any questions about this?

315
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,700
Everybody understand
this and how I got it?

316
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,790
No tricks up my sleeve.

317
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,110
It's really meant to be
relatively straightforward.

318
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,510
But the implications
will be dramatic,

319
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,030
as I'm going to show
you in a minute.

320
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,720
OK.

321
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,516
So let me go through at
least one numerical example.

322
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,640
And then I'm going to show
you why this is actually

323
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,380
so important.

324
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,400
From 1946 to 2001, Motorola
had an average monthly return

325
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,130
of 1.75%, and a standard
deviation of 9.73%.

326
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,670
General Motors had an
average return of 1.08%,

327
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,030
and a standard
deviation of 6.23%.

328
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,700
That has obviously since
gone up a great deal,

329
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,010
the standard deviation, that is.

330
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,230
And their correlation
is 0.37, or 37%.

331
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,590
How would a portfolio of
the two stocks perform?

332
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,510
Well, it depends.

333
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,840
What are the weights?

334
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,685
Right?

335
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,060
If you change the
weights, you're

336
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,393
going to change the performance.

337
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:36,820
So let's just take a look.

338
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,940
If you put all your weight
on General Motors and nothing

339
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,010
on Motorola, not
surprisingly, you're

340
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,882
going to get General
Motors' return.

341
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,340
At the other end of the extreme,
if you put all your weight

342
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,650
on Motorola and nothing
on General Motors,

343
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,331
you're going to get
Motorola's characteristics.

344
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:52,830
All right?

345
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,050
Nothing mysterious about that.

346
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,420
However, if you weight the
two, so if you put 50-50

347
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,390
on General Motors
and Motorola, you're

348
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,220
going to get a return that is
50-50 of each of those returns.

349
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,721
But you're going to get
a risk that is not 50-50.

350
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,220
Right?

351
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,579
Because the risks,
the risks don't

352
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,560
aggregate in a linear way.

353
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,400
The risks actually
aggregate non-linearly

354
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
because of those
covariances or correlations.

355
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,829
OK.

356
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,350
So what you see here
is that by taking

357
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,590
a weighted average of
the two, what you can do

358
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,970
is you can boost
your return to 1.42%,

359
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,510
but the extra risk
you're taking is

360
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:46,820
from 6.23% to 6.68% per month.

361
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,880
That's not a big
increase in risk,

362
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,140
but that is a pretty
significant increase in return.

363
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,780
Now again, I'm not telling you
that's what you all should do,

364
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,790
because it depends on
your risk preferences.

365
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,587
And for the next
lecture or two, I'm

366
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,420
going to be saying that
over and over again.

367
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,070
I'm going to be saying
it depends upon your risk

368
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,580
preferences.

369
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,999
But at the end of the
next two lectures,

370
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,290
I'm going to be able to tell
you something that doesn't

371
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,550
depend on your risk preference.

372
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,830
I'm going to be able to tell
you something that all of you

373
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,630
should be willing to
do if you're rational.

374
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,330
And if you're not, I will
trade with you personally

375
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,440
to help you learn rationality.

376
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
OK?

377
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,600
But for now, I
don't have a story

378
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,540
to tell you about which of
these rows you ought to take.

379
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,130
There is no ought to here.

380
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,850
It's just a matter of what you
prefer, risk versus return.

381
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,960
Right?

382
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,990
Now interestingly, I
put here one more case

383
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,640
which lies outside
of the band of 0, 1.

384
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,020
This is a case where you've
put 125% of your wealth

385
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,760
into Motorola.

386
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,570
And you've put negative
25% of your wealth

387
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,582
into General Motors.

388
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:52,790
Remember, we talked about
this in the very beginning.

389
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,660
You're using short
selling to short sell

390
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,360
General Motors,
which you might think

391
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,485
is not a bad idea nowadays,
given how troubled they are.

392
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:06,730
You're going to short General
Motors, take the proceeds,

393
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,330
and put that plus the 100%
that you started with,

394
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,530
you're going to put
that in Motorola.

395
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,700
So you really want to make
a big bet on communications

396
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,370
and microprocessors.

397
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,930
And you're going
to leverage that

398
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,530
bet by putting a negative
bet on the auto industry.

399
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,710
That's what that
last row implies.

400
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,360
And what you get is a
much, much higher rate

401
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,781
of return than anything
else in the other examples.

402
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:36,280
Right?

403
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,540
Much higher rate of return.

404
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,430
But look at the risk.

405
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,132
Now the risk is
close to double what

406
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,590
you would have gotten had you
put all your money in General

407
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,089
Motors.

408
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,930
Are you willing to do that?

409
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,430
Well, you can
easily imagine there

410
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,910
are people in this class that
would be delighted to do that,

411
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,790
and there are others of you
that would be scared to death.

412
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,480
That's way too much volatility.

413
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,310
These are monthly
numbers, by the way.

414
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,760
So if you want to calculate
the annual equivalent,

415
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,060
how would you do that?

416
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,480
How would you get an
annual standard deviation

417
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,530
from a monthly
standard deviation?

418
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,290
Any idea?

419
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,270
Well, let's do the return first.

420
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,860
How do you annualize the monthly
return to get an annual return?

421
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,350
Let's forget about compounding.

422
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,340
What would you do?

423
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,256
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

424
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,040
ANDREW LO: What?

425
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,059
Multiply by 12.

426
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:25,600
That's right.

427
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
If you forget about
confounding, you multiply by 12.

428
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,890
What if you didn't
forget about compounding?

429
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,901
Then what do you do?

430
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

431
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,860
ANDREW LO: Add 1, raise
it to the 12th power,

432
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,670
then subtract 1.

433
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,750
That's right.

434
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,440
OK.

435
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,770
What about risk?

436
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,270
Ah, see?

437
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,200
This is tricky.

438
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,810
What's the variance
of a 12-month return

439
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,260
in relationship to the
variance of a one-month return?

440
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,560
We haven't talked about that.

441
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
What is it?

442
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,700
Yeah?

443
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,417
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

444
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,000
ANDREW LO: No.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,500
No.

446
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,670
It doesn't compound in that way.

447
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,010
Variance is actually
a little simpler,

448
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,460
under certain assumptions.

449
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,120
Yeah?

450
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,332
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

451
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,040
ANDREW LO: Right.

452
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,900
There's no correlation
between one month to the next.

453
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

454
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
ANDREW LO: That's right.

455
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,419
Agreed.

456
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,980
So let's assume that away.

457
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,480
Then it's constant.

458
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,390
But the monthly
variance is constant.

459
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,250
But what's the annual variance?

460
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,537
What's the riskiness
of a 12-month return

461
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,870
if you know what the riskiness
of a one-month return is?

462
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,506
Yeah?

463
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

464
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,810
ANDREW LO: Well, it can,
depending on your assumptions.

465
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,580
But I want a simple
set of assumptions.

466
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,080
Andy?

467
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

468
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,060
ANDREW LO: Variance, yes.

469
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,840
Multiply by 12.

470
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,130
Now why is that?

471
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,740
It's because-- and
you know all this.

472
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,345
You know this from your DMD.

473
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,490
At least I think you do.

474
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,770
You may not think
you do, but you do.

475
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,000
The variance of a plus
b is equal to what?

476
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,680
Who can tell me?

477
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,390
What's the variance of a plus b?

478
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,470
Two random variables.

479
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,930
Variance of a plus
variance of b plus 2 times

480
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,310
the covariance of a and b.

481
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,824
If the covariance is 0,
then it is the variance

482
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:24,990
of a plus the variance of b.

483
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,700
Absolutely, that's right.

484
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,070
So if we assume
there are no cycles,

485
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,680
there are no predictabilities,
there's no regularities,

486
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,540
there's no correlation,
every month

487
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,560
is independent of
every other month,

488
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,630
than the variance
of a 12-month return

489
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,680
is literally just 12 times the
variance of a one-month return,

490
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,650
assuming the variances stay
constant throughout the month.

491
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,270
The monthly variance
doesn't go up or down.

492
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,740
OK?

493
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,784
Now, that's the variance.

494
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,200
What about the
standard deviation?

495
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,674
The standard deviation is the
square root of the variance.

496
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,090
So that means that the standard
deviation on an annualized

497
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,840
basis is equal to square root of
12 times the standard deviation

498
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,420
of a monthly.

499
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,920
OK.

500
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,390
So finally, we're almost there.

501
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,070
What's the square root of 12?

502
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,760
Something between
3 and 4, right?

503
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,180
So I don't know, call
it 3 and 1/2, whatever.

504
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,850
We have to take this number and
multiply it by about 3 and 1/2.

505
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,220
And that will get us an
approximate annual standard

506
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,370
deviation.

507
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,600
So a 12% volatility
multiplied by 3 and 1/2,

508
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,650
you're talking about some crazy
volatile stock, or portfolio.

509
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,277
But actually,
nowadays, you know,

510
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:34,860
we're used to that
kind of volatility.

511
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,310
That's no big deal.

512
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,090
But relative to the
individual stock,

513
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,830
it's quite a bit more volatile.

514
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,300
OK?

515
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,120
So this is an example
of how you compute

516
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,160
the riskiness and the return
of a portfolio of two stocks.

517
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,979
And when you do this, you get
a whole bunch of possibilities.

518
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,770
And the idea behind
modern portfolio theory

519
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,760
is you pick the one
that you like the best.

520
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,320
And that's optimal for you.

521
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,500
Now let me graph this in that
mean-standard deviation graph,

522
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,020
and you'll see something
really interesting.

523
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,550
So here's General Motors
and there is Motorola.

524
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,520
And what I've graphed
with the red dots

525
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,570
is just the different
combinations of 25/75,

526
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,820
50/50, 75/25, and so on.

527
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,860
And so the red dots that are
strictly between 0 and 1,

528
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,830
where the weights are between
0 and 1, those are the dots

529
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,566
contained in that arc
between GM and Motorola.

530
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,940
So the first point
I want to make

531
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,370
is that when you graph
the risk/reward trade-off,

532
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,430
as I told you, it's not linear.

533
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,540
It's non-linear.

534
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,470
In fact, it's curved.

535
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,950
It looks like a bullet.

536
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,450
OK?

537
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,670
That tells you right
away that there's

538
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,970
something more subtle
about portfolio theory

539
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,370
than just taking
weighted averages.

540
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,620
The means are weighted
averages, but the variances

541
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,027
are not because of the
covariance between them.

542
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,610
And then when you
take the square root

543
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,200
to get the standard deviation,
it looks a little bit more

544
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,120
complicated, yet again.

545
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,920
It looks like this.

546
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,570
Now that red dot that
goes beyond Motorola,

547
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,500
that red dot is the case where
you're shorting General Motors

548
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,290
and you're using the proceeds
to take an extra large position

549
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,350
in Motorola.

550
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,490
OK?

551
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,869
So you're going beyond the
Motorola risk/reward point.

552
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,660
So I need you to spend
a little bit of time

553
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,990
now twisting your
brain in a way that

554
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,700
makes this more understandable.

555
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,420
What I mean by that
is that you have

556
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,330
to think about the weights
of the various different

557
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,380
portfolios.

558
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,050
But the weights don't
show up on this graph.

559
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,550
But I want you to
keep those weights

560
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,870
in the back of your head.

561
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,320
So while you're
looking at this graph,

562
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,840
you have to remember
that as you move along,

563
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,430
that bullet, the omegas,
the weights are changing.

564
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,860
So at the General Motors dot,
your weight for General Motors

565
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,590
is a 100% and your
weight for Motorola is 0.

566
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,470
At the Motorola dot, your
weight for General Motors is 0

567
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,360
and your weight for
Motorola is 100%.

568
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,390
And as you vary the weights,
you trace this arc, this curve.

569
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,000
And as you go beyond either
General Motors or Motorola--

570
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,620
in other words,
as you short sell

571
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,310
one to invest more
than 100% in the other,

572
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,280
you then go outside of the two
points in either direction.

573
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,800
Right?

574
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,140
Any questions about this graph?

575
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,922
Yeah?

576
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:16,190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

577
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:16,920
ANDREW LO: OK.

578
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,586
So how do you calculate
the correlation?

579
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:19,740
That's a good question.

580
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,810
Historically, the
way you would do it

581
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,790
is exactly the way
that these correlations

582
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,530
look like they're defined.

583
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,460
So in other words, you would
calculate the covariance

584
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,090
by essentially taking
a historical average

585
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,650
of these cross products.

586
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,970
So going back to the first slide
in this particular lecture,

587
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,291
I gave you a formula that
shows you how to do that.

588
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,790
Let me go back and
take a look at it

589
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,123
so that you refresh your memory.

590
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:47,210
Let's see.

591
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,570
Oh, it was not in this lecture.

592
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,890
It was in the previous lecture.

593
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,264
In a previous
lecture, I gave you

594
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:53,190
a formula that shows
you how to calculate

595
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,920
the weighted average of this,
or the historical average.

596
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,320
It's basically just
taking historical data

597
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,530
and then estimating this
quantity right here,

598
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,780
this particular cross product.

599
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,820
The omega weights come
out, because that's

600
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,080
what you get to decide.

601
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,580
But the inside stuff, how
to calculate that is simply

602
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,820
to take, historically, your
actual return minus the mean

603
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:26,520
of i, Rjt minus the mean of
j, and then take 1 over t,

604
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:33,350
and that's your estimator
for the sigma hat ij.

605
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,620
So you get historical data and
you would estimate the mean,

606
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,600
estimate the mean, take the
cross products over time.

607
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,990
This t goes from 1 to t, and
that gets you an estimator.

608
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,000
Is that the best estimator?

609
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,150
Not necessarily, because
things change over time.

610
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,720
So you have to worry about that.

611
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,870
And that's what
you learn in 15433,

612
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,960
how to actually implement a
lot of these ideas using data.

613
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,556
Yeah?

614
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

615
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:01,960
ANDREW LO: OK.

616
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

617
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,870
ANDREW LO: OK.

618
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,630
So the question is, is there
any recommended length of time

619
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,480
for which you would go
about estimating the data,

620
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,590
estimating these
quantities using the data?

621
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,450
The answer is no.

622
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,020
There's no recommended
time, simply because you

623
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,270
have to trade off two things.

624
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,670
The longer time you
have, the more accurate

625
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,530
your estimate is going to be.

626
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,660
In the limit, as t
goes to infinity,

627
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
you'll get a perfect estimator.

628
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,050
OK?

629
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,610
However, that's
under the assumption

630
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,470
that nothing ever changes.

631
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,370
And I'm pretty sure
that beyond some t,

632
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,970
over let's say 150 or
200 years, you know,

633
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,360
we didn't exist in terms
of stock markets and data.

634
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,690
I don't think that, for
example, General Motors

635
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,310
goes back 200 years.

636
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,432
So beyond some t, this is
going to look very boring.

637
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,140
But the other thing
you have to trade off

638
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,080
is the fact that market
conditions change.

639
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,440
So General Motors today is
not what General Motors was,

640
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,860
even 10 years ago.

641
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,410
So if you use lots
of data, you're

642
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,720
going to build into
your results what

643
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,910
are called non-stationarities.

644
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,400
And the bottom line is
you have to balance off

645
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,920
the non-stationarities
against the error

646
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,470
that you introduce by
not using enough data.

647
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,260
And that really is
where 15433 comes in.

648
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,380
So there are methods
that we have developed

649
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,880
for balancing those two.

650
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,370
But the bottom line is that
there isn't one single answer.

651
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,130
So it depends on how
unstable the markets are

652
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,400
and how volatile the underlying
estimates are, given the data.

653
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah?

654
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:54,204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

655
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:55,120
ANDREW LO: Well, sure.

656
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,085
You could try to
include a full cycle.

657
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,710
But then you're left
with the question,

658
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,690
the full cycle of what?

659
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,730
For example, there
are these things

660
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,610
called Kondratiev
cycles that claim to be

661
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,530
something like 50 year periods.

662
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,320
So if you want to
include one of those,

663
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,810
you've got to include
50 years of data.

664
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,700
But do you really think
that General Motors

665
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,160
is the same company
over those 50 years?

666
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
You're building in a
lot of bias in terms

667
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,820
of the non-stationarity
of one aspect,

668
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,950
while incorporating
the stationarities

669
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,570
of another aspect.

670
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,880
So how do you balance
off those two, right?

671
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,280
This is where it
gets more complex.

672
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,130
And you have to take a stand on
the kind of non-stationarities

673
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,180
that are in the data.

674
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,213
Other questions?

675
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:40,139
Yeah?

676
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:52,542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

677
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,500
ANDREW LO: Well, first
of all, we're not trying

678
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,770
to predict the stock market.

679
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,311
Remember, we're not
trying to predict

680
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,880
where markets are going to go.

681
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,040
What we're suggesting
is that there

682
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,030
are underlying parameters of the
data that are stable over time.

683
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,570
So in other words, the stocks
can go up or down, right?

684
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,740
But on average, they
have some level of return

685
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,330
that people expect,
given their risk.

686
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,060
That's what we're
assuming is stable.

687
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,190
Similarly, covariances.

688
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,470
Stocks can go up or
down in relationship

689
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,940
to other stocks
going down or up.

690
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
We don't know what's going
to happen day to day.

691
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,310
But over a period
of time, it seems

692
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,240
like there's a pattern where
most stocks on the New York

693
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,580
and American stock
exchanges and NASDAQ,

694
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,620
they seem to go up together
and they seem to go

695
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,684
down together, on average.

696
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:40,100
So that's what,
really, what we're

697
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,590
trying to distill from the data.

698
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,870
It's very different
than trying to forecast

699
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,516
what's going to happen with
the stock market next week.

700
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,640
And this, I told you, is
the fundamental difference

701
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,310
between academic finance
and Warren Buffett.

702
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,430
Warren Buffett is
all about prediction.

703
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,670
He's not about creating
a good portfolio that

704
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,130
will be worth something
reasonable over a period

705
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,670
of time.

706
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,920
What he wants to do is he
wants to beat the market.

707
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,429
He wants to find undervalued
stocks, invest in them,

708
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:08,720
and then sell them when they
actually reach equilibrium

709
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,010
or become overvalued.

710
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,760
Right?

711
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,966
That's a very different
approach and perspective

712
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,090
than what we're doing here.

713
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,534
So that's a good question, and
it highlights that distinction.

714
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:18,502
Yeah?

715
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:25,239
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

716
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,280
ANDREW LO: Yes, there is.

717
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,880
And there have been many studies
that have been done on it.

718
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,720
And that is beyond the
scope of this course.

719
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,520
So I'm going to refer
you, again, to 15433.

720
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,292
But I will tell you,
at the end of this,

721
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,750
once I get through this and
make sure everybody is with me,

722
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,600
I will tell you how
this works in practice.

723
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,440
OK?

724
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,150
So I'll talk a bit
about applications.

725
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,900
But first I want to
get through the theory

726
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,480
to make sure we
all understand it.

727
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,500
All right.

728
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,620
So we now have this bullet.

729
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,830
And the bullet obviously
depends on all the parameters.

730
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,220
But in particular, it
depends upon the correlation.

731
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,630
The reason that there
is a bullet shape

732
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,840
is because there is a
correlation between these two

733
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,719
stocks.

734
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,620
And by the way, this correlation
and this bullet shape

735
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,940
is really important.

736
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,960
OK?

737
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,290
I'll tell you why
it's really important.

738
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,860
Take a look at a vertical
slice, a vertical line

739
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,110
going through the GM dot.

740
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,110
That vertical line is
the riskiness of GM.

741
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,610
Right?

742
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,730
It's the standard
deviation of GM.

743
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,650
One of the things that you'll
notice about this graph

744
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,130
is that if you only had two
stocks available to you, GM

745
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:51,100
and Motorola, the least amount
of risk that you could possibly

746
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,219
create for yourself is if you
put 100% in General Motors.

747
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,540
In other words, if all you
cared about was going west,

748
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,190
the most extreme
west you can go other

749
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,810
than putting your
money in T-bills

750
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,630
over here, the most extreme west
you can go is General Motors.

751
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,870
You can't get any
less risky than that.

752
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,390
Yeah?

753
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,700
Question?

754
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:23,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

755
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,870
ANDREW LO: What I'm
saying is, if you

756
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,690
are trying to get less
risky as possible,

757
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,990
and you only had General
Motors or Motorola,

758
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,300
then the most west you
can go is General Motors.

759
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,800
Right?

760
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,200
That's all.

761
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,280
However, however, this
is the important point.

762
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,510
If now I let you take
weighted averages of the two,

763
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,050
if I give you the right
to form a portfolio,

764
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:00,370
then you can get a dot,
which is this dot right here.

765
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,710
That dot, everybody in
this room should prefer

766
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,660
that dot to General Motors.

767
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,740
Why?

768
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,110
Because it's less risk
than General Motors,

769
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,767
but it's also higher return.

770
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,850
There's no downside, at
least from the perspective

771
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,141
of mean and standard deviation.

772
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,690
There may be other reasons
you don't like that dot.

773
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,330
But if all you care about is
mean and standard deviation,

774
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,320
that dot is strictly preferred.

775
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,150
So I just made all
of you better off

776
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,250
with this piece of knowledge.

777
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,440
Just by telling you
how to weight these two

778
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,560
stocks and the fact that they've
got some kind of correlation,

779
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,670
I've given you a mechanism
of reducing your risk and,

780
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,790
and increasing your expected
rate of return, both.

781
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,290
OK?

782
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,756
So if you were
really risk averse,

783
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,380
if you said to
yourself, you know what?

784
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,240
I don't want all this
fancy stock picking.

785
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,420
Just give me the least
risky stock of the two.

786
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,487
Then you'd be at General Motors.

787
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,570
And then if I came to you
and said, you know what?

788
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,861
I can do even better than that.

789
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:01,800
I can get even less risk
than General Motors.

790
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,730
And at the same time, I'm going
to give you higher return.

791
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,770
So right there, the
value of portfolio theory

792
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,460
is pretty clear.

793
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,908
It gives you options
you did not have.

794
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:15,864
Yeah?

795
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:29,064
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

796
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:29,730
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

797
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:36,010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

798
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,010
ANDREW LO: That's right.

799
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,551
That's right.

800
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:40,034
When you have correlations
that are unstable over time

801
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,450
and you didn't account for
them, you can get into trouble.

802
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,210
OK?

803
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,151
Again, let's come back to that
after I go through all of this.

804
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:46,650
All right?

805
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,200
So, just if this is a clarifying
question, I'll answer.

806
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,130
But extensions, let's wait until
we actually go through this.

807
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,880
OK.

808
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,190
So let me talk about the General
Motors and Motorola example,

809
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,640
but now where I am going to
tell you that correlations

810
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,360
are changing over time.

811
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,709
So let's do the example
that Lewis wants us to do.

812
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,250
Let's actually assume
the correlation

813
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,200
is, I don't know,
0 or 1 or minus 1.

814
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,570
Let's go through all three
cases and see what happens.

815
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,350
You'll see some remarkable
things coming out of this.

816
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,690
If the correlation is 0,
then it's pretty easy for you

817
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,080
to just plug in 0
for that correlation

818
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,580
in that second equation.

819
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,740
And all you get are
the first two terms

820
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,750
of that variance expression.

821
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,440
Right?

822
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,956
So when you assume that the--

823
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:36,580
when you assume that
the correlation is

824
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,940
0, when this thing
is 0, what happens

825
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,430
is that this entire
term goes away

826
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,220
and all you have are
the first two terms.

827
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,960
That's this column
right over here.

828
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,620
OK?

829
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,900
So I've just produced
the previous table

830
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,600
but with the assumption of 0
correlation, and I get that.

831
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,350
Now I'm not going to
graph it for you yet.

832
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,330
I want to just show you
what happens when you

833
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,320
choose different assumptions.

834
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,750
So that's one assumption.

835
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,000
On the other hand, if I
choose a different assumption,

836
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,730
if I choose the assumption
that the correlation is,

837
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,440
let's say 1--

838
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,020
so in other words, they
are perfectly correlated--

839
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,945
then I'm going to get,
I'm going to get this.

840
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm going to get
this becoming 1,

841
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,760
and then I'll get
another simplification

842
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,650
of this expression.

843
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,130
And similarly, if I assume that
the correlation is minus 1,

844
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,680
then I'm going to get yet
another simplification

845
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,520
of this expression.

846
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,930
It's an algebra that I'll
show you in a minute.

847
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,410
But this is what I'm doing
in these three columns.

848
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,260
I'm assuming different values
of correlation between General

849
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,410
Motors and Motorola,
and then computing

850
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,390
the standard deviation of the
portfolio using this formula.

851
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,890
OK?

852
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,130
So you can all do this at
home, do this in a spreadsheet.

853
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,650
It's going to be very
easy to check my work.

854
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,570
But I want to show you the
graph because that's really,

855
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,530
I think, the insightful
intuition here.

856
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,250
Look at the graphs.

857
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,410
These are the graphs of
the three different cases

858
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,210
of zero correlation,
perfect correlation,

859
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,820
and perfect negative
correlation.

860
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,830
I want to go to each
one of these with you.

861
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,710
So the case of perfect
positive correlation,

862
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,000
it turns out that the
risk/reward trade off is

863
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,410
actually just a straight line.

864
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,230
It gets really, really simple.

865
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,350
It's just a straight line.

866
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,089
So in particular, there
is no non-linearity.

867
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:37,380
Because if they're perfectly
correlated, you know what?

868
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,182
You basically have
virtually the same stock.

869
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:41,640
The only difference
is that they're

870
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,180
different scales of each other.

871
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,950
Right?

872
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,706
But if they're
perfectly correlated,

873
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:48,330
that means that there's a linear
relationship between those two

874
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,320
stocks.

875
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,820
And so when you do this
mean variance analysis,

876
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,900
in mean variance
space, you basically

877
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,790
get no nonlinear-- you
don't get that little bump,

878
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,470
the little bullet
that we saw before.

879
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:01,970
Right?

880
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,580
So there's no way you can get
less risk than General Motors

881
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,580
unless you end up shorting
Motorola and putting it

882
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,330
in General Motors.

883
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,350
And then your expected
return goes down,

884
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,941
as well as your risk.

885
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:16,440
All right.

886
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,040
Now let's take the case where
you've got no correlation.

887
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,590
It turns out that if
you have no correlation,

888
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,870
you get the bullet.

889
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,430
But the bullet is even
more wedge shaped.

890
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,970
What that means is that you
can reduce even more risk

891
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,220
without getting rid of return.

892
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,080
Remember the red dot that we
saw in the previous slide?

893
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,190
This red dot?

894
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,710
Well, in the case where
you've got 0 correlation--

895
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,980
this is the case where the
correlation is 0.37, 37%.

896
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,480
Right?

897
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,980
That's what the data tells us.

898
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,000
But if you assume that
the correlation was zero,

899
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,900
you would get even more
of a savings of volatility

900
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,100
for a given level
of expected return.

901
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,600
OK?

902
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,310
So it would look like this.

903
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,840
You see how this
bullet sticks out

904
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,210
a lot more than the
previous red dot that

905
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,070
was somewhere over here?

906
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,220
OK?

907
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,170
Now let's continue.

908
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,560
Suppose the correlation
is minus 50%.

909
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,600
Then you get an
even wider bullet,

910
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,110
that sticks out even
more, that saves you

911
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,310
more standard deviation.

912
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,690
You're getting to
the west even more.

913
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,110
And finally, and here is where
you get a really remarkable

914
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:36,700
result. If the
correlation is minus 100%,

915
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,310
you know what you get?

916
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,510
You get a piecewise
linear trade off.

917
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,060
You get this and that.

918
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,100
It doesn't turn into a wedge.

919
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,630
It turns into a triangle that
actually hits the x-axis.

920
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,850
And the reason this is
such a startling result

921
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,030
is it tells us that
there exists a way

922
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,710
to construct a portfolio that
gives us a rate of return

923
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:09,410
of like 1.39% with no risk.

924
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,920
Zero risk.

925
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,390
1.39%.

926
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,200
Let's just call it 1.3%
to be conservative.

927
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,530
Multiply that by
12 and you're going

928
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,600
to get something like what?

929
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,980
16% a year?

930
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,950
You tell me if you know of any
investment opportunities that

931
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,490
gives you a return of
16% a year with no risk,

932
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,070
and I'll examine that
for you carefully.

933
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,290
OK?

934
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,480
It doesn't exist, of course.

935
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,250
The reason it doesn't
exist is because you

936
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:48,860
can't find two assets that have
perfect negative correlation.

937
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,890
If you could, there
are wondrous things

938
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,310
you could achieve
with that combination.

939
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,400
And portfolio theory
basically tells us how, right?

940
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,930
This is a recipe book for
how to exploit correlation.

941
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:04,430
All right?

942
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,040
Now again, I can't
tell you where

943
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,110
you should be on
this curve other

944
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,030
than if it's really minus
1, then I would be here.

945
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,790
OK?

946
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,020
Lots of return, no risk.

947
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,990
That's an arbitrage.

948
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,780
We know that that
can't possibly happen.

949
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,696
There's no free lunch.

950
00:44:20,696 --> 00:44:24,650
There's no arbitrage, on
average, over circumstances.

951
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,220
However, if the
bullet is minus 0.5,

952
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,890
then you've got
lots of opportunity

953
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,240
to create really attractive
portfolios that doesn't require

954
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,890
Warren Buffett's skills.

955
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,431
There's no forecasting here.

956
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:38,930
Right?

957
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,264
We're not trying to pick stocks.

958
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:42,180
We're not trying to see
how the market's going

959
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,070
to do next month.

960
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,540
Who knows?

961
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,480
All we're assuming is
that means and variances

962
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,990
are stable over time,
and the correlation

963
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:51,980
is stable over time.

964
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,070
Those are nontrivial
assumptions, I grant you.

965
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,750
But if you believe
in those assumptions

966
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,700
more than you believe
in your ability

967
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,100
to forecast what's going
to happen to General Motors

968
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,710
six months from now, then
this might be a good way

969
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,330
to construct a portfolio.

970
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,970
But I haven't told you where
on this curve you ought to be.

971
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,620
I just told you how to
construct that curve.

972
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,120
All right?

973
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,310
It's your job to look
at the curve and say,

974
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,080
I like this point,
or I like that point,

975
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,230
based upon your own
personal preferences

976
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,640
for risk and reward.

977
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,180
So we're not there yet where
I can tell you how to behave.

978
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,750
I will get there in about
a lecture and a half.

979
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,890
But we've got to build
up the infrastructure

980
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,420
to be able to get us there.

981
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,170
OK.

982
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,180
So what this tells
us is that we need

983
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,420
to know what the correlation
is in order to figure out

984
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,600
where we are going to be on
these different curves, which

985
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,760
curve is going to apply.

986
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,220
When you have lots
of correlation,

987
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,670
a correlation of 1, there
really isn't much of a risk

988
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,280
savings per unit return.

989
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,960
We can't get a lower risk
for a given level of return.

990
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,660
But we can if there is less
correlation than perfect.

991
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,680
And these are the different
curves that illustrate that.

992
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,180
OK.

993
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,940
So there are some other
examples that I'd like you

994
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,450
to work through on your own.

995
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,390
This is another
portfolio calculation.

996
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,690
Just go through the same
calculations that we did here.

997
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,510
And you know, you'll graph the
different risk/reward trade off

998
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,120
between these two, General
Dynamics and Motorola.

999
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,580
And you can get exactly
the same analysis

1000
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,450
with those two stocks,
General Dynamics and Motorola.

1001
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,200
OK?

1002
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,080
Now what about if you
got a risk free rate?

1003
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,760
So suppose that the two
assets that I want to look at

1004
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,750
is not General Motors and
Motorola, but rather the stock

1005
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,700
market and treasury bills.

1006
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,710
Then what does your risk/reward
trade off look like?

1007
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,180
Well, it turns out that in the
case where treasury bills are

1008
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:57,070
in question, the volatility
of treasury bills

1009
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,260
is virtually zero.

1010
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,420
It's not exactly
zero because there

1011
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,450
may be some kind of randomness
in the underlying rates

1012
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,000
of return because of
inflationary expectations.

1013
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,050
But as an approximation,
if it's a risk free rate

1014
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,780
and you know that you're going
to get that risk free rate,

1015
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,450
then the volatility
of that return

1016
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,940
is in fact 0 over
that period of time.

1017
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,860
So in that case, the expected
rate of return of a portfolio

1018
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,990
between the stock
market and T-bills,

1019
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,520
that's the weighted average.

1020
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,300
But the variance is going to
be very simple because it's

1021
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,150
going to be the variance
of 1, which is 0,

1022
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,850
plus the variance
of the other, plus 2

1023
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,260
times the weighted average
times the covariance.

1024
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,560
But there is no covariance.

1025
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,060
Right?

1026
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,250
There's no correlation
because one of the things

1027
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,290
is non-random.

1028
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,670
And so when you work out
the weights for the two

1029
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,846
and you graph
them, you get this.

1030
00:47:55,846 --> 00:48:00,860
This is a beautiful thing, nice
and simple, no weird curves

1031
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,320
or any kind of bullet shape.

1032
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,370
You've got T-bills here.

1033
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,460
You've got the
stock market here.

1034
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,640
And the weights,
as you vary them,

1035
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,740
will bring you anywhere
along this line or possibly

1036
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,090
up over here.

1037
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,820
If you're in the middle of
this line-- so literally,

1038
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,770
if you have the same distance
between here and here and here

1039
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,760
and here--

1040
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,400
that actually gives
you a 50-50 weighting

1041
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,980
on those portfolio weights.

1042
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,370
So geometrically, this
actually corresponds

1043
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:40,070
to a 50-50 weighting of
T-bills and the S&P. OK?

1044
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,940
Now question, what happens
when you are over here?

1045
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,710
Let's suppose you're
at this point.

1046
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,350
At this point, what would your
portfolio weights look like?

1047
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,490
How would you characterize that?

1048
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,170
Yeah, Brian?

1049
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,190
AUDIENCE: Short T-bills to
buy into the stock market?

1050
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,190
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1051
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:57,970
Short T-bills.

1052
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,510
What does it mean
to short T-bills?

1053
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,380
What are you doing?

1054
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,482
You're borrowing.

1055
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:05,440
You're borrowing money.

1056
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,700
You're leveraging.

1057
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,530
When you're shorting
T-bills, you're

1058
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,860
basically borrowing and
getting cash upfront

1059
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,670
you're to pay back
later with interest.

1060
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,390
So shorting T-bills
is just borrowing.

1061
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,880
If you're borrowing money
and you're putting it

1062
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,580
into the stock market in
addition to 100% of your own

1063
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,990
wealth-- you've borrowed
additional money to put it

1064
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,911
in the stock market--

1065
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,410
then you're going
to be way up here.

1066
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:31,360
Higher return, much higher
up here than down here,

1067
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,710
but you're going to get
higher risk, as well.

1068
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:38,270
So leverage, this idea
of borrowing and putting

1069
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,450
your money in the stock
market, that increases

1070
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,850
your expected rate of return.

1071
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,980
But it also increases your risk.

1072
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,210
OK?

1073
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,575
Leverage increases your risk.

1074
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:51,950
And now getting back to the
question that Lewis asked us,

1075
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,600
is this where we
got into trouble

1076
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,680
with the current crisis?

1077
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,850
Yes, in a nutshell it is.

1078
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,850
But it's more complicated
because the underlying

1079
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,530
securities are more complex.

1080
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,160
But the basic idea is
if you leverage up,

1081
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,590
if you leverage
up, way up here--

1082
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,570
you're up maybe out there--

1083
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,756
and all of a sudden
there's a bump in the road

1084
00:50:11,756 --> 00:50:13,880
and what you are leveraging,
this thing that you're

1085
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,550
investing in is not nearly
as smooth and as riskless

1086
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,760
as you thought it was,
it could wipe you out.

1087
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,100
And one of those elements that
could cause such a wipeout

1088
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,550
is if you somehow
forgot about the fact

1089
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,350
that correlations can change.

1090
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:39,810
So you thought that you were,
I don't know, somewhere here,

1091
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,380
and all of a sudden
correlations go to 1

1092
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,700
and now you're
actually over here.

1093
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,940
You see how risk can
change really quickly?

1094
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,790
Correlations don't have
to be stable over time.

1095
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,099
And that's the lesson that
most people in industry,

1096
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:57,390
who don't have a finance
background, who've never taken

1097
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,880
this course, they won't know.

1098
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,590
These are physicists
or mathematicians

1099
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,370
or computer scientists.

1100
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,490
They estimate the correlation.

1101
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,580
It's a parameter, like
the gravitational constant

1102
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,690
or Avogadro's number.

1103
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,350
Let's plug it in.

1104
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:12,630
Hey, 9.08 times 10 the 23rd,
that's what it should be.

1105
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,650
And nobody ever told them
that it could change.

1106
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,820
And when it changes, bad things
can happen really quickly.

1107
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,320
So we're going to
come back to that.

1108
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,347
But let's get the standard
theory down first,

1109
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,180
and then we'll talk a
bit about application.

1110
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,679
Anon?

1111
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:32,370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1112
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,158
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1113
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:40,544
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1114
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,210
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1115
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:47,760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1116
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,930
ANDREW LO: Right here?

1117
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:49,950
Of course.

1118
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,440
Because you might want to
get more return and you're

1119
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,030
willing to take on risk.

1120
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,170
Let's take a look at this.

1121
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,690
This bullet point
here says that you're

1122
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,190
going to be at
approximately, something--

1123
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,370
if the correlation-- let's
be realistic about it.

1124
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:02,520
OK?

1125
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,440
The correlation is not
going to be minus 0.5.

1126
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,690
It's going to be more like 0.37.

1127
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,530
So this bullet here is
going to be like 1--

1128
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,570
I don't know, let's call it
1.3% just to make it easy.

1129
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,760
And you've got a standard
deviation of about 6%.

1130
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,390
OK?

1131
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,010
So on an annualized
basis, that's

1132
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:22,740
giving you a return, 1.3 times
12 is something like what, 16%?

1133
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,600
16% return, but the risk on
an annualized basis multiplied

1134
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,790
by 3 and 1/2 is
about, let's say 20%.

1135
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,940
So 20%, 22% annual
standard deviation

1136
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,470
for a 16% rate of return.

1137
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,290
Now some of you might like that.

1138
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,680
But I have a few
friends here for whom

1139
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,546
that return is just boring.

1140
00:52:44,546 --> 00:52:46,420
That's just not going
to get their attention.

1141
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,520
What they want is they
want to be up here,

1142
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,680
you know, like at
2% rate of return.

1143
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,350
2% rate of return per
month is about 24% a year.

1144
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,840
So if you're a
hedge fund manager,

1145
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,570
24% is when you start
to begin to feel alive.

1146
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,290
You know?

1147
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,660
That's when things really
start to happen for you.

1148
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,080
And at 24% annual
return, you can't

1149
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,464
have volatility
of like 15% or 20%

1150
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:08,880
unless you're doing
something, you

1151
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,970
know, really different than
the standard market portfolio.

1152
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,760
So a hedge fund manager is going
to say, Anon, give me a break.

1153
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,551
You know, this is going
to put me to sleep.

1154
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:18,520
I want to be up here.

1155
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,470
But you know, you've got
a family, three kids,

1156
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,290
you have to worry about
making mortgage payments.

1157
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,720
That kind of lifestyle
is not for you.

1158
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,630
So in both cases,
though, in both cases,

1159
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:33,290
we can agree that where we want
to be is on this curve, right?

1160
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:37,810
In other words, you would never
want to be here, at this point.

1161
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,500
Why?

1162
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,140
Because if you were
here, you can either,

1163
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,830
for the same level of
risk, increase your return.

1164
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,100
Or for the same level of
return, decrease your risk.

1165
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,540
So what we can agree
on, even though we

1166
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,450
don't agree on where we
want to be on that curve,

1167
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,750
we can all agree we want to
be on that curve as opposed

1168
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,890
to inside the curve.

1169
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,625
Right?

1170
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1171
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:00,920
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

1172
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,679
Great point.

1173
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,470
Why would we want to
be on the bottom half?

1174
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,610
Nobody would want to do that.

1175
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,090
Because if were on
the bottom half,

1176
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,465
you can just as easily
move up to the top,

1177
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:10,340
and you have a higher
expected rate of return

1178
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,741
for the same level of risk.

1179
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:12,740
So you're exactly right.

1180
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,590
That bottom half of the curve,
you can just throw it away.

1181
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,452
All right?

1182
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:18,410
The only people that are
going to be down there

1183
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,600
are knuckleheads.

1184
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
All right?

1185
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,520
So we don't want
to be down there.

1186
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,280
So in fact, the only part of
the curve that really matters

1187
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
is this point, going
all the way up.

1188
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,680
And we're going to give a
name to that in a minute.

1189
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,469
That's going to be called the
efficient frontier because you

1190
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,010
would never want to
do anything else.

1191
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,270
Actually, that's not quite true.

1192
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:44,450
What everybody would like to do
is they'd like to be up here.

1193
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,740
Unfortunately, we
can't get there.

1194
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,970
We can't get there with just
General Motors and Motorola.

1195
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,860
In a few minutes,
I'm going to show you

1196
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,250
how you might be able to
get there with other stocks.

1197
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,590
If you introduce
other assets, then you

1198
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,820
might be able to get there.

1199
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,190
But you can't get
there right now.

1200
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,360
OK.

1201
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,280
So here we are with
stocks and T-bills.

1202
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,690
And we know that we'll get
the linear combination here.

1203
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,720
What I'd like to do next is to
make this yet more complicated.

1204
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,220
All right?

1205
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,050
And before I do, let
me just summarize

1206
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,640
what we've done so far.

1207
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,490
What we've done is to
show that with two assets,

1208
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,280
we can do all of
this analytically,

1209
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,330
and illustrate graphically,
all of the intuition that holds

1210
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,460
for the more general case.

1211
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,910
With two assets, the
expected rate of return

1212
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,870
is just a simple
weighted average.

1213
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,870
But the variance is not just
a simple weighted average.

1214
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,480
It's more complicated and
it depends, in particular,

1215
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,830
on the correlation.

1216
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,590
For different correlations,
we get different shapes

1217
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,260
of trade offs in
mean-variance space.

1218
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,320
And you have to understand
what those trade offs are.

1219
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,840
If it turns out that one of
the two assets is T-bills,

1220
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,990
for example, then the trade
off is really straight line.

1221
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,740
OK?

1222
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,320
But if both assets
are risky, then you

1223
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,940
get the bullet shape until
you either get minus 1 or 1

1224
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,020
in terms of correlations.

1225
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,350
And then you get straight
lines of different stripes

1226
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,950
in those two different cases.

1227
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,450
OK.

1228
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,670
Now we're ready to talk
about the general case.

1229
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,630
The general case works exactly
the same as the two asset case.

1230
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,460
You've got your means.

1231
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,840
You've got your variances.

1232
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,580
And you've got your covariances.

1233
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,040
And you add up all of
these different covariances

1234
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,050
to get the total variance
of the portfolio.

1235
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:35,480
And if you consider a
couple of simple cases,

1236
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,520
like for example, an
equal weighted portfolio--

1237
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,670
so you've got n assets
and you put each of your--

1238
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,670
for each of your assets, you
put 1 over n of your wealth

1239
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,750
in them.

1240
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,090
Then you can show
that the variance

1241
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:55,730
of your entire portfolio is
equal to the average variance

1242
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:01,940
plus n times n minus 1 times
the average covariance.

1243
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,390
When n gets large,
then it turns out

1244
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,110
that the average
variance doesn't matter.

1245
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,080
What is driving the
risk of your portfolio

1246
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,910
has nothing to do
with the variance

1247
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,560
of the individual components.

1248
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,640
What it has to do with is what
the average covariance is.

1249
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,610
That's what's driving the
risk of your portfolio.

1250
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,380
Because you've got a
lot more covariances

1251
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,140
than you do variances.

1252
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,110
OK?

1253
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,760
So this is kind
of a neat insight

1254
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,220
because it says that
it's really important how

1255
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,110
things are related.

1256
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,330
And as those
relationships change,

1257
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,585
the risk of your portfolio
is going to change.

1258
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,460
So getting back to
Lewis's point about what's

1259
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,590
going on in current
markets and what

1260
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,420
caught a lot of
portfolio managers

1261
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,540
by surprise with the
subprime markets,

1262
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,110
if the risk of your portfolio
is approximately given

1263
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,740
by the average covariance
and you've been assuming

1264
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,460
all along that you've got
this big pool of mortgages,

1265
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,730
and the mortgages
are all uncorrelated,

1266
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,600
you've essentially assumed that
you've got virtually no risk.

1267
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,480
Because the average
covariance by assumption

1268
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,180
and by historical
analysis is close to zero.

1269
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:17,020
But when the real state
market goes down nationally,

1270
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,410
then everybody
starts to default.

1271
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,410
And foreclosures become
very highly correlated.

1272
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,880
And so you can see how
overnight, literally overnight,

1273
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,980
your risks can shoot up.

1274
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,530
And you're not prepared
for that unless you

1275
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,970
know that this is what's
going on in your portfolio.

1276
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,641
Yup?

1277
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:54,037
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1278
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:55,120
ANDREW LO: Great question.

1279
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,670
Why should things change
in terms of correlation?

1280
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,740
Well, you know what?

1281
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,940
I'll give you an example.

1282
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,710
I'll give you a
personal example?

1283
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,680
Correlation is a function
of human behavior, right?

1284
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,790
I mean, prices are being
formed by you and I, investors.

1285
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,420
And so correlations simply
means that all of us

1286
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,030
end up doing the same
thing around to same time.

1287
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,270
Right?

1288
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,850
I'm going to be heading to the
airport later on this evening.

1289
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,300
And I don't expect
that there's going

1290
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,300
to be much of a big deal
getting on my flight.

1291
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,970
I'll probably get to the
airport about half an hour,

1292
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,140
45 minutes ahead of time.

1293
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,130
It's just a shuttle.

1294
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:36,402
So I'm heading to Washington,
so it's not a big deal.

1295
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:38,360
What's going to happen
in two weeks from today?

1296
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,430
Anything?

1297
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,500
Anything going on two weeks from
today that you can think of?

1298
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,580
Thanksgiving.

1299
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,342
So if I went to the airport
two weeks from today

1300
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,550
and tried to get on that
shuttle half an hour before,

1301
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,460
you think I can
get on the flight?

1302
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,070
Why not?

1303
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,770
Because everybody else
is going to do that.

1304
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,460
Well, why should everything
be correlated on that day?

1305
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,710
Isn't that a Wednesday
like every other Wednesday?

1306
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,740
Well, it's not.

1307
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,400
It's because somehow
we've all decided

1308
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,830
that we're going to take
off at the same time

1309
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,560
on the same day in that year.

1310
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,253
Right?

1311
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:20,826
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1312
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,200
ANDREW LO: Well, first of all,
I don't think Thanksgiving

1313
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,600
is that low a probability.

1314
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,040
OK?

1315
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,950
But to your point, is that
the correlation changing?

1316
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,150
Well, it is.

1317
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:37,110
Correlation is a statistical
measure of two objects.

1318
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,020
And what we're trying to capture
is when they move up or down

1319
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,160
at the same time.

1320
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,140
Right?

1321
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,890
So what I'm trying to
get at is that there

1322
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,265
are certain periods
of time where

1323
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:49,750
human behavior, all of a sudden,
becomes very highly correlated.

1324
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,310
And there are many
reasons for that.

1325
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:53,100
In particular,
Thanksgiving is a reason

1326
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,340
we all decide that Thursday
is this national holiday.

1327
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,615
And therefore, on that
Wednesday, we actually

1328
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,240
have to travel in
order to get to where

1329
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,020
we need to go by Thursday.

1330
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,850
Right?

1331
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,430
But any arbitrary
Wednesday is not

1332
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,380
going to be necessarily
highly correlated.

1333
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,380
So when I go to the airport
on a typical Wednesday,

1334
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,030
I don't expect it to be so bad.

1335
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,710
But on Wednesday
before Thanksgiving,

1336
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,510
it's going to be a madhouse.

1337
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,290
Right?

1338
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,240
That's an example of
a changing correlation

1339
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,730
because of a
particular coordination

1340
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,320
that we've all agreed upon.

1341
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,322
Now that's a relatively
artificial example.

1342
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:25,530
But I did it to make a point.

1343
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,904
Now let me give
you a real answer

1344
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:30,250
to your question about why
things may be correlated.

1345
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:34,390
When we are all scared about
the value of our investments,

1346
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,690
when our fear circuitry
gets triggered,

1347
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,440
what's the natural instinct
for all of us because it's

1348
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,640
hardwired into our brains?

1349
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,060
It's to get to safety.

1350
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,130
It's to get out of
those bad assets

1351
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,630
and get into the good assets.

1352
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,170
Right?

1353
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,710
You saw that three month T-bill
yield at 10 basis points, or 5

1354
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,880
basis points?

1355
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,490
That's a sign that we're
all scared to death

1356
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,960
and we want to get to safety.

1357
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,460
That's an example
of a correlation.

1358
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:00,960
Why?

1359
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,280
Because everybody is going to
be selling at the same time.

1360
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,140
In a crowded theater, if you
smell smoke and somebody shouts

1361
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,250
fire, what are you going to do?

1362
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,980
It's not rocket
science to predict

1363
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,360
that the four exits
that are out there

1364
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,180
will be a bit
crowded after that.

1365
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,640
Right?

1366
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,590
So correlation is not
a physical quantity.

1367
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,180
That's the problem with
physics and biology.

1368
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,770
Physics has parameters that
don't change over time.

1369
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,720
I wish we could have
that in finance.

1370
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,840
We don't.

1371
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,632
We have parameters that
are not parameters.

1372
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:36,673
They're random variables.

1373
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,090
They depend on a lot of things.

1374
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,780
Correlation is one of them.

1375
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,410
And until we start recognizing
that correlations are really

1376
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:44,935
part and partial of
human interactions,

1377
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,060
we're going to continue to
make mistakes like we've

1378
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,270
made over the last 10 years.

1379
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,370
And that's a simple
example of that.

1380
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,122
Other question?

1381
01:02:53,122 --> 01:02:53,622
Yeah.

1382
01:02:53,622 --> 01:02:57,865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1383
01:02:57,865 --> 01:02:58,490
ANDREW LO: Yes.

1384
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:07,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1385
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,410
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1386
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,040
That's true.

1387
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,250
That's possible.

1388
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,720
So you have to decide whether
or not what you're looking at

1389
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,120
is an aberration,
or whether it's

1390
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,590
something that's systematic.

1391
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,440
So for example, if I didn't
know anything about Thanksgiving

1392
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,740
and I happened to travel on
Wednesdays on a regular basis

1393
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,520
to Washington, then
you know, in two weeks,

1394
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,922
I'll get-- it's really crowded.

1395
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:31,880
And then it won't be
crowded, won't be crowded,

1396
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,930
won't be crowded.

1397
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,970
And pretty soon,
after a while, I'll

1398
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,730
say, well, that was
just a 1% event.

1399
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,040
Of course, next year
it will happen again.

1400
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,470
And then I'll say, gee, you
know, well, that's another 1%,

1401
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:43,970
kind of.

1402
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,730
But pretty soon I'm going to
realize that, gee, it seems

1403
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,260
like there's a pattern here.

1404
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:53,620
And that 1%, it's not just
so simple as a 1% error.

1405
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,500
Statistics, remember, is a
mathematical quantification

1406
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,460
of our stupidity.

1407
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,960
Right?

1408
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,150
I mean, what we don't know.

1409
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,650
Well, we don't know why things
happen the way they happen,

1410
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,300
so we put a distribution on it.

1411
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,650
We say that it's normal.

1412
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,650
And we say that there's
5% this way, 5% that way.

1413
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,150
But that just is
a representation

1414
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,170
of our ignorance.

1415
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:15,699
The more we know, the less we
have to rely on statistics.

1416
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:17,240
So I don't need
statistics to tell me

1417
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,698
that two weeks from
now, it's going

1418
01:04:18,698 --> 01:04:19,970
to be really crowded at Logan.

1419
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,070
But if I didn't know
about Thanksgiving,

1420
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,460
if I came from Mars and I
was doing a study of airport

1421
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,590
congestion, it would
take me a while

1422
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:29,480
to get enough data
to figure out that

1423
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,220
once a year on the Wednesday
before the Thursday

1424
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,240
in, you know, November,
it gets crowded.

1425
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,710
So the challenge for all of
you is how much intelligence

1426
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,820
can you bring to the analysis.

1427
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,730
What I'm showing you is
very simple mathematics.

1428
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,820
Mathematics is not enough.

1429
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,620
If you just had the
mathematics, you

1430
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,990
would be losing money,
you know, continuously.

1431
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:53,990
Because there's just much more
to financial markets than just

1432
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,570
the math.

1433
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,070
OK?

1434
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:55,903
The math is trivial.

1435
01:04:55,903 --> 01:04:57,660
This is high school algebra.

1436
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,690
But the real key
is to put together

1437
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,120
the framework of economic
and financial analysis

1438
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,830
with the mathematics.

1439
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:06,500
So let me continue doing that.

1440
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:11,840
This is another example of
computing the average variance,

1441
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,730
and then looking
at the volatility

1442
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:17,130
of your particular holdings,
given different correlations.

1443
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,342
So I want you to do
lots of exercises

1444
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:21,050
where you look at
different correlations.

1445
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,240
I don't ever want you
to take correlation

1446
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,700
as a parameter that
is fixed over time,

1447
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:26,870
when you apply the stuff.

1448
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,750
When you're doing problem sets
in final exams, that's fine.

1449
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,850
You know, the correlation
is whatever it is.

1450
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:33,950
But recognize that in
practice, these things

1451
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:36,200
change a lot over time.

1452
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,820
OK?

1453
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,030
Now the idea behind
correlation is

1454
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,590
that they help
you reduce the ups

1455
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:45,920
and the downs of the
variance of your portfolio.

1456
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,160
But it turns out that there's
a limit to how much of the risk

1457
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,420
you can reduce.

1458
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,420
And this graph basically
shows that as you

1459
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,370
add more and more securities--

1460
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,190
even though the correlations
are bouncing around--

1461
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,230
as you add more and
more securities,

1462
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,170
there ends up being some
kind of a steady state

1463
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:07,310
limit to what the variance
of your overall portfolio is.

1464
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:12,210
After 20, 30, 40,
50, 100 stocks,

1465
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,400
you'll notice that the
variance of your portfolio

1466
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,190
doesn't go down anymore.

1467
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:21,480
And it turns out that that
limit, whatever that is,

1468
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,120
is what we consider to be
the systematic risk that

1469
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,220
is implicit in the economy.

1470
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,490
In other words, that's the
risk that no matter how well

1471
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:37,110
diversified you are, you've
got to bear that risk.

1472
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,720
Everybody, all of
us, we have to,

1473
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,690
we can't get any
less risky than that

1474
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,120
unless we start putting
our money in the mattress

1475
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,350
or in T-bills.

1476
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,250
OK?

1477
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:50,210
That limit is known as the
systematic, or market risk,

1478
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,740
of a portfolio.

1479
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:55,370
So, see here is the graph
of your portfolio variance

1480
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,010
as you increase more
and more securities.

1481
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,980
But at some point, it
asymptotes to this level,

1482
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,040
which is what I'm going
to be focusing on,

1483
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,440
as undiversifiable risk.

1484
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,110
It's the risk that's
left over after all

1485
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,840
of the various correlations
have done what they

1486
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:16,040
can to dampen the ups and
the downs of your collection

1487
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,780
of securities.

1488
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,360
And obviously,
there's going to be

1489
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,550
some calculations you'll
need to do to figure out

1490
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,849
what that number is.

1491
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:25,640
But I want to give you
the intuition first,

1492
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,167
and then we'll do
the calculations.

1493
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,000
And then we're going
to study the properties

1494
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,750
of this hard limit.

1495
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,850
OK?

1496
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:39,260
Now, I'm about to proceed to
the next stage of our analysis

1497
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,810
where we start
asking the question,

1498
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:46,431
how do we pick the very
best possible portfolio.

1499
01:07:46,431 --> 01:07:47,930
But before I do, I
want to make sure

1500
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,880
that everybody is comfortable
with the analytics

1501
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,546
we've developed.

1502
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:53,180
If you have any questions, now
would be a good time to ask.

1503
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,721
Because from this
point on, I'm going

1504
01:07:54,721 --> 01:07:57,980
to assume that you understand
how portfolio theory works,

1505
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,410
the mechanics of
portfolio weights,

1506
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,890
and how to compute means,
variances, covariances,

1507
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,790
and what they imply
for the portfolio.

1508
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,160
Question, yeah?

1509
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,240
AUDIENCE: Earlier,
you said that we

1510
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,860
start from this, ensuring that
the markets are pretty much

1511
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,730
stable.

1512
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:17,140
But I'm wondering, how
reasonable is that assumption?

1513
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:23,140
And why would nobody ever pick
a lower part of on the curve,

1514
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:28,170
for example, you know, if there
was a big scandal tomorrow,

1515
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,390
like a corruption, like
I'm thinking about Enron

1516
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:35,080
or [INAUDIBLE] in Italy.

1517
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,710
Why would I not want to
short sell, you know,

1518
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:46,466
the higher return stock and
buy the lower return stock,

1519
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:48,960
and take the lower
part of the curve?

1520
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,160
ANDREW LO: You might, if
there are other elements that

1521
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,410
are in this analysis.

1522
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:58,020
So as I said, this
analysis assumes

1523
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:02,319
there are only two dimensions,
mean and standard deviation.

1524
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,359
Right?

1525
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,189
You've now introduced
a third, which

1526
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:08,850
is corporate responsibility
or corporate governance

1527
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,439
or fraud or something like that.

1528
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,240
Then you would need
three dimensions.

1529
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,680
And there'd be something
sticking outside the screen.

1530
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,470
And then you'd have to choose
among the three possibilities.

1531
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,420
So it's possible
that you want to be

1532
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,890
down here because this company
has a better reputation

1533
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:28,470
than this one up here.

1534
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,210
But then what
you're telling me is

1535
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:34,439
that reputation matters to
you beyond standard deviation

1536
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:37,600
and expected return.

1537
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,715
What's that?

1538
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:40,456
AUDIENCE: Market conditions.

1539
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:42,330
ANDREW LO: Stable means
that these parameters

1540
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:45,857
are likely to stay
the same over time.

1541
01:09:45,857 --> 01:09:47,732
AUDIENCE: There's a
crisis every three years.

1542
01:09:47,732 --> 01:09:50,040
There's an industry
crisis every two years.

1543
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,450
ANDREW LO: Right.

1544
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,850
Well, the argument that
a financial economist

1545
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,100
would make--

1546
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,850
and I'm not saying
that I believe in this.

1547
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,350
I'm going to tell
you what I believe

1548
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,430
at the end of this class.

1549
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,770
But I'm telling you now
what the party line is,

1550
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,510
and what's in your textbook.

1551
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,850
What's in your textbook
and what the party line is

1552
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:09,090
is that when you use
historical amounts of data,

1553
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,730
those kind of crisis periods
are in there already.

1554
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,430
So if I estimate
the correlations,

1555
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:19,560
including October '87, including
March 2000, the bursting

1556
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,770
of the internet bubble,
August 1998, LTCM,

1557
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,960
if I include all of
those in my data,

1558
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,360
then it's captured in there.

1559
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,720
Right?

1560
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,530
It's not captured today.

1561
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,790
In other words, this point
here for General Dynamics

1562
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:36,490
doesn't reflect that
there's a crisis today.

1563
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,640
What it reflects is, on average,
over a long period of time--

1564
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,760
some of which includes crises--

1565
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,810
that's what the expected
return looks like.

1566
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:50,580
And so I've already incorporated
that into the parameters.

1567
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,310
And if it so happens that
today is a bad day for General

1568
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,620
Dynamics, that
shouldn't influence

1569
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,850
whether you buy it or not.

1570
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,558
Because what you should
be thinking about

1571
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:03,360
is over the next 15 or 20
years, how will my portfolio do.

1572
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,210
So that's another difference
in perspective from us

1573
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,890
versus Warren Buffett.

1574
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:10,290
Although actually, not
as much as you think.

1575
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:13,290
Warren Buffett typically takes
a long term perspective, right?

1576
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,042
His investment in Goldman Sachs?

1577
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,500
We all thought it
was a great deal.

1578
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,540
He's lost money in it
since he put that money

1579
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,936
in a few weeks ago.

1580
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:22,060
But is he worried about it?

1581
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,130
I don't think so.

1582
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:26,040
Because he's invested in it
for the next 15 to 20 years.

1583
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:30,300
And I believe, as he does,
that he got a great deal

1584
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,320
over that time period.

1585
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,100
So if you care about what's
going to happen tomorrow,

1586
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,380
then all of the things
that I'm telling you,

1587
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,450
you should not take
that as seriously.

1588
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,510
Because these kind of
parameters aren't made for day

1589
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,130
to day forecasting.

1590
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,930
Then you need to get
hedge fund models.

1591
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,380
And for that, you need
to take not only 433,

1592
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,130
but a number of other
courses, and courses

1593
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,210
that aren't even offered yet.

1594
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,070
Because frankly, if I
told you how to do it,

1595
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:53,945
I'd have to kill you.

1596
01:11:53,945 --> 01:11:54,570
Right?

1597
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:56,850
Highly proprietary.

1598
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,370
But this is the
approach where we're not

1599
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,660
trying to forecast markets.

1600
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,460
And so I'm acknowledging
that you're

1601
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,470
right that there
are instabilities.

1602
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,720
But as long as I'm using a
long enough amount of data,

1603
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,590
that it's in there.

1604
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,550
It's captured in there,
in that set of parameters.

1605
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:11,610
OK?

1606
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:14,310
If it's not, if you know of
something that's not in here,

1607
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:17,250
obviously you can't expect this
to give you the right answer.

1608
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,580
And you have to adjust your
use of this technology,

1609
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,190
accordingly.

1610
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,650
Other questions?

1611
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,326
Yeah?

1612
01:12:25,326 --> 01:12:29,404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1613
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:30,070
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1614
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:45,080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1615
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,430
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1616
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,230
That's right.

1617
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:47,760
Yeah.

1618
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:54,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1619
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,660
ANDREW LO: Well,
you have to know

1620
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,580
how to build those
other variables

1621
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,910
into this kind of a framework.

1622
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,825
That's another
way of putting it.

1623
01:13:01,825 --> 01:13:03,200
So in other words,
this framework

1624
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,090
is still useful
in the case where

1625
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,980
you've got other variables.

1626
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,710
But you just need to know how
those other variables will

1627
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:13,640
impact the parameters
for this analysis.

1628
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,690
If you can figure that out, then
you're a hedge fund manager.

1629
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,190
Right?

1630
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,000
That's what hedge
funds try to do.

1631
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,730
They try to figure out
how all of these relations

1632
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,550
impact on how to construct
a good portfolio.

1633
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,348
All right?

1634
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1635
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,360
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1636
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,170
For example.

1637
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,929
That would be one
way of looking at it.

1638
01:13:31,929 --> 01:13:32,970
But there are other ways.

1639
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,550
It doesn't have to
be quantitative.

1640
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,110
There are a lot of talented
hedge fund managers

1641
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,670
that don't know how
to use a calculator,

1642
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:38,503
make a lot of money.

1643
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:40,100
OK?

1644
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,795
So don't think that it's all
about quantitative analysis.

1645
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:43,670
That's what we think.

1646
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,140
That's how I think.

1647
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,994
That's how MIT may think.

1648
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:49,160
But that's not the only way
to make money out there.

1649
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,870
You know, Warren
Buffett, I don't think

1650
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:53,210
knows how to calculate
these covariances.

1651
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:56,250
But he's done OK.

1652
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,270
So but I think what we can
do with this framework is

1653
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:02,570
to analyze how he
does what he does,

1654
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:06,130
and understand it in the context
of this kind of a framework.

1655
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:06,860
All right.

1656
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:12,470
So let's now go to the next
topic, which is, all right,

1657
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:15,710
how do we choose
a good portfolio,

1658
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:18,410
given what we now know
about this framework?

1659
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,989
Well, we said before--

1660
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,530
Ryan pointed out--
that we never want

1661
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:24,410
to be on the lower
part of that frontier.

1662
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,830
So that's one thing we know.

1663
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,330
Right?

1664
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,810
We don't want to be
on the bottom part.

1665
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,190
So we want to be on
the efficient frontier.

1666
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:34,310
Now this entire
bullet can be viewed

1667
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:37,550
as what's called the
minimum variance boundary.

1668
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,940
Meaning, for any given
investment over here,

1669
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,390
we have the absolute
minimum variance

1670
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,850
that has the same level
of expected return.

1671
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,490
So when I go, when
I go horizontally,

1672
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:52,040
I'm looking at the
smallest amount

1673
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,260
of risk I can take for
that same level of expected

1674
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,060
rate of return.

1675
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,680
That's what this bullet can
be viewed as giving you.

1676
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,610
And it turns out that because
we like expected return,

1677
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,790
and we don't like
risk, we want to be

1678
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,680
on the upper part
of that bullet.

1679
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,500
So this upper part is known
as the efficient frontier.

1680
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,680
So that's the one thing we can
tell about portfolio theory.

1681
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,060
It's that we want to
be on the upper branch.

1682
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,920
But where on the
upper branch depends

1683
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,830
upon our risk preferences.

1684
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,370
OK?

1685
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:27,650
So here's a concrete example.

1686
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:30,500
Suppose you can invest in
any combination of General

1687
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,540
Motors, IBM, and Motorola.

1688
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,010
What portfolio would you choose?

1689
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,260
So these are the data
that you would start with.

1690
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:37,760
OK?

1691
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,030
The means and the standard
deviations, and then of course,

1692
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,050
the covariances.

1693
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,820
You've got to have
the covariances to be

1694
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:46,250
able to calculate that bullet.

1695
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,154
So you can invest
in any combination.

1696
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:51,070
What would you choose?

1697
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,890
Let's calculate the
expected rate of return

1698
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:57,730
and the variance
of that portfolio.

1699
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,550
And you want to ask
the question, what

1700
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,430
looks good to you?

1701
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,200
OK?

1702
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,480
Well, it turns out
that when you calculate

1703
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,570
this kind of a bullet,
you find out something

1704
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:13,810
that's, yet again, amazing.

1705
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:17,560
What you find is that
the bullet actually

1706
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,820
is better than any of the three
stocks that you started with.

1707
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,640
So look at where the
three stocks are--

1708
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,517
General Motors,
IBM, and Motorola--

1709
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:29,350
and the bullet, look
at where the bullet is.

1710
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:35,160
The bullet is strictly to the
northwest of these stocks.

1711
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,730
Right?

1712
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,850
In other words, you can do
better than any one of these,

1713
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,370
either by going here
or by going here.

1714
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,830
For the same level of risk,
you can get a higher return.

1715
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:47,980
For the same level of expected
return, you can get lower risk.

1716
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,450
OK?

1717
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:52,450
So the first point is
that portfolio theory,

1718
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:55,600
for multiple stocks, is
even more compelling.

1719
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,530
Because now, with
those two stocks,

1720
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:02,290
at least the two stocks were on
that minimum variance boundary.

1721
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,050
Now, with three
stocks and more, it's

1722
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,360
possible that none
of the stocks are

1723
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,080
going to be on the
minimum variance boundary.

1724
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,898
Yeah?

1725
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,890
AUDIENCE: What I don't
understand is this.

1726
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,880
S This is backward looking.

1727
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,420
So if people between companies
and so on all make this graph

1728
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,980
and they all decide to
strategize based on this graph,

1729
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,046
the price of these
stocks next day

1730
01:17:26,046 --> 01:17:27,920
are going to be correlated
in a different way

1731
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,640
than you expect because
it's going to effect the--

1732
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,810
ANDREW LO: Very good point.

1733
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,360
But it turns out your
conclusion is false.

1734
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,040
But that's a good
question to ask.

1735
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,890
And I'm going to answer that,
not today, but on Monday.

1736
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,040
When we go over
the question, what

1737
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,820
happens when
everybody does it, I'm

1738
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,660
going to deal with
that question head on.

1739
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:47,380
OK?

1740
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,270
That's going to be a
very important point.

1741
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:53,380
And this is going to be one of
the very few instances where

1742
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:57,360
when everybody does what I
tell you they're going to do,

1743
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,760
that's actually going to
give you an equilibrium.

1744
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,240
And everything will work
out in just the right way.

1745
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,820
That's the magic of the CAPM.

1746
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,100
But you're right that
Warren Buffett could not

1747
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,055
answer that criticism.

1748
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:11,680
If you talk to Warren
Buffett and said,

1749
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,947
Warren, if everybody did what
you did, then it wouldn't work.

1750
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,280
And he would say, you know what?

1751
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:18,821
That's right.

1752
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:21,700
That's why nobody can
ever do what I do.

1753
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,260
I'm just smarter
than everybody else.

1754
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,010
And so, I'm sorry.

1755
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,110
That's the way it goes.

1756
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,180
Here, I'm not appealing
to everybody being

1757
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,440
smarter than everybody else.

1758
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,450
Because frankly, we're not.

1759
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:34,610
What I'm appealing to,
what I will appeal to,

1760
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,710
is if everybody does the right
thing-- by the right thing,

1761
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,490
I'm about to tell you what
that right thing is-- everybody

1762
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:43,040
is on that upper
branch and maximizes

1763
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,080
their risk/reward trade off,
a very special thing happens.

1764
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,740
All right?

1765
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,470
I'm going to keep that
as a surprise for Monday.

1766
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,400
OK, question?

1767
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,140
A question?

1768
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:53,835
Yeah.

1769
01:18:53,835 --> 01:18:56,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1770
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,314
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1771
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:58,730
Well, first of
all, it's not clear

1772
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,271
that Warren Buffett
is number one.

1773
01:19:00,271 --> 01:19:00,770
All right?

1774
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:03,650
He's got a long track record
and he's got the biggest pie.

1775
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,300
But in terms of
actual track record,

1776
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,550
he doesn't have the
best track record.

1777
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:07,340
There are people
that you've never

1778
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,946
heard of that have
a better track

1779
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:10,070
record than Warren Buffett.

1780
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,250
For example, there's a fellow
by the name of James Simons--

1781
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,280
who I may have mentioned earlier
on as a hedge fund manager--

1782
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,190
who also happens to be a
first rate mathematician,

1783
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:20,780
who started up a
hedge fund called

1784
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,400
Renaissance Technologies.

1785
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,710
That is probably the
single best track

1786
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:28,190
record of any manager in
the history of investments.

1787
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,290
And he does it completely
quantitatively,

1788
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:33,200
completely automated.

1789
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:39,410
He hires something like 100
PhDs that work on nothing else

1790
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:42,350
but how to forecast the
next minute, as well as

1791
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,732
the next hour, the next year.

1792
01:19:44,732 --> 01:19:46,190
It's an extraordinary
track record.

1793
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,840
So there are a number
of folks like that.

1794
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,256
Let me not dwell
on that, but I'll

1795
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,680
come back to that
in a few lectures

1796
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,390
when we talk about
performance attribution.

1797
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,370
OK.

1798
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,980
So I'm going to leave you
with one final thought

1799
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,880
since we're out of time.

1800
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,530
There is going to be a
very special role played

1801
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:07,490
by a portfolio called
the Tangency Portfolio.

1802
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:11,790
And I want you to think about
how your risk/reward trade off

1803
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:15,830
would look when
you mix your T-bill

1804
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:20,620
risk-free asset with arbitrary
portfolios on this bullet.

1805
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,620
Think about what that
trade off would look like.

1806
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,200
And ask yourself
the question, does

1807
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:29,150
there exist a special portfolio
on that efficient frontier

1808
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:32,581
that everybody in this classroom
is going to want to have?

1809
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:33,080
All right?

1810
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,110
I want you to identify them.

1811
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,151
And I'm going to ask you
that question on Monday,

1812
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:37,631
and I expect an answer.

1813
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:38,130
All right?

1814
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,280
I'll see you on Monday.
