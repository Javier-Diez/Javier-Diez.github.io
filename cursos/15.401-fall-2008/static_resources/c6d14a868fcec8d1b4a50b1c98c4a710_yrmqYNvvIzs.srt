00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,830
ANDREW LO: Now, also, before
I begin today's lecture,

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,246
I want to comment a bit about
what's going on in the news,

10
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:36,990
because last time, on
Monday, we said-- or I said--

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,045
that the Fed was
going to cut rates.

12
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,350
[LAUGHTER]

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,880
And in fact, if you looked
at the data on Monday

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,580
and you looked at things
like the Fed fund's future

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,060
and other financial
contracts, the market

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,400
had priced in the
fact that the Fed

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,130
was going to cut at
least 25 basis points,

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,070
and actually a reasonable
probability that it

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,730
was going to cut 50.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,590
And of course, they did neither.

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,960
They actually held rates steady.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,140
But they did do something.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,130
What did they do?

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,150
Anybody know?

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,828
Yeah.

26
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:13,320
STUDENT: Extended [INAUDIBLE]

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,340
ANDREW LO: How large a loan?

28
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,520
$85 billion, which, even among
friends, is a lot of money.

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,230
[LAUGHTER]

30
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,840
Now, this is yet again an
extraordinary and unprecedented

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,890
measure.

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,820
We know that the Fed did
backstop Bear Stearns.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,360
But the Fed didn't spend any
direct money on Bear Stearns.

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,210
They basically got JP
Morgan to buy Bear Stearns

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,700
and negotiated the deal.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,050
In this instance, the Fed
is lending money to AIG,

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,090
lending $85 billion.

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,490
And AIG isn't even a bank.

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,210
So what do you
think is going on?

40
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,716
Does that make sense?

41
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,090
What does that tell you about
what's going on in markets?

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,480
The fact that everybody thought
the Fed was gonna cut rates,

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,620
and they didn't--

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,200
that shows a certain
kind of restraint.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,910
In fact, I think it
was in this class

46
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,090
that somebody mentioned, well,
rates are already down at 2%.

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,490
How much more can they cut?

48
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,622
I mean, if they cut
50 basis points,

49
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,330
that leaves them very
little flexibility.

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,990
And also, if you think that the
reason we are in this crisis

51
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,620
is because borrowing has been
so low for so long, that people

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,990
have been going out making
all these bad loans when they

53
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,007
shouldn't be doing
that to begin with,

54
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,340
cutting rates is not going
to really help that situation

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,770
but can only encourage it.

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,330
Nevertheless,
there was a crisis.

57
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,060
Certainly over the weekend,
we had some very bad news.

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,240
Lehman Brothers went under,
and the Fed did what?

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,230
Nothing.

60
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,780
So if the Fed did
nothing for Lehman,

61
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,567
yet they extended an $85
billion loan for AIG,

62
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,900
something's got to be different.

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,200
Right?

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,090
I mean, I guess you
could see whether or not

65
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,480
Ben Bernanke has a
brother-in-law working at AIG,

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
but I don't think that's it.

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,253
Yeah.

68
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:02,031
STUDENT: [? But today it was ?]
reported that Barclays is

69
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,320
actually going to go ahead
and buy [? them. ?] So what

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,820
changed--

71
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,980
ANDREW LO: Well,
the announcement

72
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,280
is that Barclays is buying some
of the US operations of Lehman

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,060
Brothers.

74
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,510
They are cherry-picking the
operations that they want.

75
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,660
What Lehman tried to do over
the weekend was broker a deal

76
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,490
where Barclays would
buy all of them,

77
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,200
assume all their
obligations, and allow

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,450
them to keep on going as
a going business concern.

79
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,450
Barclays couldn't do that,
because they couldn't

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,670
get shareholder
approval quickly enough,

81
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,520
and also ostensibly
because the Fed would not

82
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,700
backstop any losses that
Lehman had hidden in its books.

83
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,890
And in a matter
of 48 hours, it's,

84
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,770
kind of, hard to figure
out all the buried bodies

85
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,770
in an organization as complex
and as large as Lehman.

86
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,120
But Barclays is going ahead
and purchasing those units

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,849
that they like, and
there are many units

88
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,140
at Lehman Brothers that are
extraordinarily profitable,

89
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,667
very good businesses
with excellent people.

90
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,250
So Barclays is going
ahead with those.

91
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,800
And by the way, there are
all sorts of other sharks

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,320
that are swimming around
Lehman, cherry-picking various

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,310
different groups.

94
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,160
This is part of the problem
with these this kind

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,150
of financial distress.

96
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,985
We're going to actually get
to this at about lecture 18.

97
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,860
We're going to talk
about financial distress,

98
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,943
and I'm going to bring you
back to Lehman Brothers

99
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:14,300
and ask you to think
about the problems

100
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,470
that this company faces.

101
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,700
Because think about it.

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,902
Now that it's been announced
that Lehman is liquidating--

103
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,110
well, let me put it this way.

104
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,550
Suppose you were working
at Lehman Brothers,

105
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,080
suppose that you've
been there 15 years,

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,455
and suppose that
you were running

107
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:28,389
one of the most successful
proprietary trading groups

108
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,180
at Lehman Brothers.

109
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,630
And now, this news comes up,
and it's a surprise to you.

110
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,070
What is your first reaction?

111
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,490
What are you going to do?

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,990
Yeah?

113
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

114
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,340
ANDREW LO: Right.

115
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,480
That's certainly one thing.

116
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,771
You're going to take a look
at what your positions are.

117
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,560
And then, after you
establish that you're

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,512
OK in terms of your
trading positions,

119
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:46,220
what's the next thing
you're going to do?

120
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,950
What are you gonna
start thinking about?

121
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,100
Yeah?

122
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,430
STUDENT: Start
bringing your resume?

123
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,940
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

124
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,560
You're going to
start looking around.

125
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,350
So you're going to talk to lots
of other people about, maybe,

126
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,379
moving your entire
group of 15 people

127
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,920
that you've hand-picked
and developed

128
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,954
over the last 15 years.

129
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,620
And you're gonna start
talking all sorts

130
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,500
of other counter-parties
to move your entire group.

131
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,100
And now, Barclays decides to
buy Lehman, the operations

132
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,390
that you're a part of.

133
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,640
But there's no slavery
in the United States,

134
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,800
at least not since
the 1800s, which

135
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,350
means that if you
want to walk, you can.

136
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,670
So if Lehman buys--

137
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,690
if Barclays buys Lehman and
buys the group that you're in,

138
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,210
and you're one of the most
profitable parts of that,

139
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,830
you don't have to stay.

140
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,550
So in addition to
paying for Lehman,

141
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,300
Barclays is also gonna
have to talk to you

142
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,175
and get you to stay,
which means that they're

143
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,140
going to have to pay you
an extra bonus and all

144
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,790
of your people bonuses to stay.

145
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,430
So now, the price of
having to keep Lehman

146
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,520
together has just
gone up dramatically,

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,580
because you've got to
keep all of the talent,

148
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,050
and it's very hard to do that.

149
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,510
So the fact that
Lehman is in trouble

150
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,120
has caused all sorts
of problems and will

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,510
create additional amounts
of frictions and payments

152
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,400
that otherwise wouldn't
have had to be.

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,650
So I want you to keep that
in the back of your minds--

154
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,983
the costs of financial distress.

155
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:03,910
We're going to come back to
that in, about, 10 lectures.

156
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,210
OK so-- yeah, question?

157
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,210
STUDENT: I heard a [? quote ?]
with regards to the Fed action,

158
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,560
that the Fed decided
that the problem is not

159
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,870
the cost of money but
the supply of money.

160
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,460
So they're going to infuse
capital into the market.

161
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,866
Is that just referring
to the AIG 85 billion,

162
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,520
or is there some other way
that they're infusing capital?

163
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,760
ANDREW LO: No.

164
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,051
Well, that's certainly one way.

165
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,350
But the other way is that they
are allowing the other banks

166
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,730
to borrow from them
at a lower rate.

167
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,060
So the discount window
that typically banks

168
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,890
go to borrow from the Fed--

169
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,260
they're making more money
available in that way.

170
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,870
And other central banks
are doing the same thing--

171
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,880
injecting money into
the system in order

172
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,322
to calm the fears
of individuals.

173
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,780
STUDENT: Does that lower the
effect of [? interest rate? ?]

174
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,250
ANDREW LO: Well, we're going
to see that in a minute.

175
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,600
We're going to actually--
one of the things

176
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,850
I want to talk about today
is, exactly what do we

177
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,500
see from market prices?

178
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,560
Now, on Monday, I claimed that
market prices was telling us,

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,940
there's going to be a Fed cut.

180
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,280
Clearly, it was wrong.

181
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Now, that's a very good
lesson, because what

182
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,267
this is telling us is that
market prices have information,

183
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,600
but as I told you last time,
they're not a crystal ball.

184
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,210
They're not perfect, and
so they can be wrong.

185
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,130
Apparently-- and this
is now very speculative.

186
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,800
Apparently, the Fed
decided, as you pointed out,

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,810
that it's not the availability
of-- or rather the cost

188
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,330
of funds.

189
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,390
That's not what's important,
but rather the availability.

190
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,520
In other words, they're
worried about a credit

191
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,340
crisis, a crisis of liquidity.

192
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,600
And AIG is a very important
player in that respect--

193
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,910
apparently, much
more so than Lehman.

194
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,400
Because Fed didn't do
anything to try to keep Lehman

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,940
from going under,
but an $85 billion

196
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,330
loan was what they decided
was appropriate for AIG.

197
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,070
The reason for that--

198
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,510
the ostensible reason.

199
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,310
Who knows what the
real reasons may be?

200
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,660
But the reasons that
we think this happened

201
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,250
is that AIG provides
enormous amounts of insurance

202
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,090
to a variety of other players
in the credit markets.

203
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,790
And if they go
under, if they decide

204
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,820
that they can't make good
on those insurance claims,

205
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,970
what happens is that
those investors that

206
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,450
are holding the
paper that is backed

207
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,580
by subprime assets and
that are insured by AIG--

208
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,100
once the insurance
disappears, they

209
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,090
are obligated, a number of them,
to sell those pieces of paper.

210
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,920
If you're a pension
fund, you are

211
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,190
obligated to hold only
investment grade assets.

212
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,873
If it turns out
that for any reason

213
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,914
those assets become lower
than investment grade--

214
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,122
and we're going to talk
about this at 4 o'clock today

215
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:39,960
at that proseminar.

216
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,140
If it falls below
investment grade, by law,

217
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,669
you are obligated to
get rid of those assets.

218
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,710
Now, what do you think
would happen to the market

219
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,201
if everybody all at once decided
to get rid of those assets?

220
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,812
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

221
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,520
ANDREW LO: Right.

222
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,890
And then, there'd
be a mass panic.

223
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,390
Right.

224
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,745
STUDENT: I just have--
there's something

225
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,348
simple that I don't understand.

226
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:06,300
How can the interest rate
go below the inflation rate?

227
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,130
ANDREW LO: Well,
it's not supposed to

228
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,210
for any extended period of time.

229
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,420
But for any short period
of time, it certainly can.

230
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,592
And what it says is that
the real rate is negative

231
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,050
or that the economy
is contracting.

232
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,496
STUDENT: So like right
now, $1 a year from now

233
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:20,490
is more valuable than
it [? would be ?] today.

234
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,420
Right?

235
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,400
ANDREW LO: Well, if you
take inflation into account,

236
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,534
yes, in real terms,
not in nominal terms.

237
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,700
You can never have a negative
nominal interest rate.

238
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,450
Right?

239
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,342
Unless, you know, somebody
is burning dollar bills.

240
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,800
But let me let me
hold off on that,

241
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
because I want to actually--
that brings us back

242
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,454
to the end of last lecture.

243
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,870
What I want to do
today is, I want

244
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,220
to talk about information
specifically contained

245
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,020
in interest rates.

246
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,644
And we're going to
actually take a look

247
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,579
at what the short-term
interest rate is.

248
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,120
I think you'll be,
kind of, surprised

249
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,110
to see what the three-month
T-bill rate is, as of today.

250
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,300
Anybody know what it is?

251
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,770
You've seen it?

252
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,240
2%?

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,210
No.

254
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,710
No.

255
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,180
It's lower.

256
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,729
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

257
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,520
ANDREW LO: Let me--

258
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,644
we'll see in just a minute.

259
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,430
Let me start today's
lecture by going back

260
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,010
to where we left off last time.

261
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,000
Last time, we talked about the
pricing of pure discount bonds,

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,460
bonds that pay only
principal at the end

263
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,630
and no intermediate
coupon payments.

264
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,830
And we saw that the
price today is simply

265
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,950
equal to the face
value or principal

266
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,580
at the end of the maturity
date, and then discounted back

267
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,800
using the interest rate.

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,930
And I pointed out at
the end of last lecture

269
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,020
that the interest
rate can differ,

270
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,370
depending on the horizon.

271
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,500
So a one-year
interest rate is not

272
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,180
the same as a five-year
interest rate,

273
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,530
because the market has
different expectations about how

274
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,230
the economy will do and what
the appropriate borrowing

275
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,250
rate or the time rate
of preference might be.

276
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,430
So in fact, for every horizon--

277
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,100
one year, two years,
three years, five years--

278
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,170
we have a different
interest rate.

279
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,750
It doesn't have to be
different, but in general, it

280
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,580
does tend to be different.

281
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,690
How do we find out what
these interest rates are?

282
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

283
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,220
STUDENT: The market.

284
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,011
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

285
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,630
The market.

286
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,030
The way to do it is not to think
about interest rates at all,

287
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,570
but rather to auction
off pieces of paper that

288
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,310
pay $1,000 in a year,
$1,000 in two years,

289
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,500
$1,000 in three
years, and so on.

290
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
And we auction off each
of these pieces of paper

291
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,710
and see what the prices we fetch
are, for those pieces of paper.

292
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,720
Once we have the
price and once we

293
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,240
know the face
value of $1,000, we

294
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,550
can back out the interest rate.

295
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,300
We can solve for the
interest rate, r.

296
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,050
So that's how we get the rates.

297
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,672
And what I want to do
today is to explicate

298
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,880
what those rates really mean.

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,250
I want to show you how
to read the entrails

300
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,150
and see that these rates contain
enormous amounts of information

301
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,290
about the future.

302
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,460
Not all of that
information is good.

303
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,180
So sometimes, it's
misleading and incorrect,

304
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,330
but it's always useful
in one form or another.

305
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,080
Now, to do that,
I want to develop

306
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,940
a little bit of new
notation and get

307
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,720
you to think, yet again,
differently about the evolution

308
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,280
of interest rates over time.

309
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,070
I'm going to define
what's called a spot

310
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,070
rate as the rate of
interest between today

311
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,470
and some other point in time.

312
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,220
And I'm going to talk
about future spot rates

313
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,610
as the interest rates
between some future date,

314
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,510
and then another date
even beyond that.

315
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:51,450
So to be explicit, I wanted
to find new notation called

316
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:58,320
capital R. Uppercase R is
meant to convey a one-year spot

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,940
rate of interest at a
particular point in time, t.

318
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,810
OK?

319
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,250
So capital R1
denotes the spot rate

320
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,610
of interest between
today and next year.

321
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,080
Capital R3 denotes the
spot rate of interest

322
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,220
between years 2 and 3.

323
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,360
And capital Rt denotes
the one year spot rate

324
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,690
between dates t minus 1 and t.

325
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,380
OK?

326
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,520
So these capital R's are
always one-year rates,

327
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,380
unlike the little r's, which
can denote multi-year rates,

328
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,020
depending on the application.

329
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,640
Now, there's a reason I
wanted to find these big R's.

330
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,640
It turns out that if I have
a pure discount bond that

331
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,910
pays off at year t, then I can
use the one-year spot rates

332
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,660
to compute today's price.

333
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,420
Right?

334
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,610
The one-year spot rate,
when you accumulate

335
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,480
that, when you
multiply them together,

336
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,840
will give you the
accumulated interest

337
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,910
over this entire t-year period.

338
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,980
So if I want to
discount face value, F,

339
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,770
and bring it back
to year zero, I

340
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,100
can just assume that
there exists one rate.

341
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,690
Or I can say, you know what?

342
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,760
If there are multiple rates
that differ year by year,

343
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,210
I can use those
individual rates.

344
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,580
So I get that first equation.

345
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,080
Now, we don't observe them.

346
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,320
So this is a pure fiction, in
terms of what I'm writing down.

347
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
It's a theory.

348
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,240
So I'm not telling you that we
know what those big R's are.

349
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,710
But I know that they exist,
and whatever they are,

350
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,320
this is what the price of
the bond ought to be today.

351
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,750
Any questions about that?

352
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,920
OK.

353
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,330
Now, what I do observe is the
price and F. Those things,

354
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,460
I get from the marketplace and
the contract for these bonds.

355
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,880
Therefore, it turns out that
as a very simple identity,

356
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,000
this expression, this little r--

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,630
which-- I'm adding some
more complicated notation

358
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,410
to indicate when I begin
and when I end in terms

359
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,910
of my horizon--

360
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,320
I can simply define this
little r as being equal

361
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,770
to the geometric average
of these big R's.

362
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,061
It's really just
terminology at this point.

363
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:39,560
Right?

364
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm simply saying
that in reality, we

365
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,910
have one-year interest rates
that may change over time.

366
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,190
And I know that the
price of the bond today

367
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,700
is equal to the future course
of one-year interest rates

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,652
as discounts over that period.

369
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,110
When I use those
as discount rates,

370
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,500
I bring back the value F,
and I get today's price.

371
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,460
I can just as well write that
chain of one-year interest

372
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,820
rates as a single number,
raised to the t-th power.

373
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,010
I can always do that.

374
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,330
You can think of this
little r as an average,

375
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,540
a geometric average,
of the big R's.

376
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,590
Right?

377
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,860
So the strict definition
is going to be--

378
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,810
little r is going to be the
t-th root of the product,

379
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,530
and then minus 1.

380
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,530
That's what the little r is.

381
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,520
All right?

382
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,835
You take that product, and
you raise that to the 1

383
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:38,790
over t-th power or
take the t-th root,

384
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,574
and then subtract 1 from that--
that's what my little r is.

385
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,240
Now, why am I going
through all of this?

386
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,630
It's because I want
to show you that

387
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,830
from a theoretical perspective,
the little r, which

388
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,380
we can observe,
contains information

389
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,270
about the future course
of interest rates.

390
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,120
Within the little r
are all the big R's--

391
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,079
at least today's expectations
of what those big R's are

392
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,440
going to be.

393
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,480
So it turns out that if we
look into the little r's, we

394
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,030
can actually develop
insight about what's

395
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,760
going to be happening next
year, five years from now,

396
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,387
30 years from now.

397
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,470
Now, let me give you an
example, just to make sure

398
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,290
that we understand the mechanism
by which these little r's

399
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,710
and big R's are determined.

400
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,630
Here's a set of
prices of strips.

401
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,590
These are treasury securities,
issued by the US government.

402
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,830
And then, a third party buys
them, takes the coupons,

403
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,560
creates separate
securities, and sells

404
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,080
those separate securities,
each one of which

405
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,820
is one of these coupons.

406
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,670
So from our perspective, they
look like pure discount bonds.

407
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,340
There's no intermediate
coupon payments

408
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,620
for each one of these
strips, and the maturity

409
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,170
is three months, six
months, one year, two years,

410
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,580
up to 30 years.

411
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,910
OK?

412
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,210
And those are the prices.

413
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,340
So a three-month strip
is currently priced--

414
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,130
as of August the 1st, 2001, it
was priced at a little bit less

415
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,250
than the dollar.

416
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,350
So how do we figure out what
the little r is, associated

417
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,750
with those various prices?

418
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,110
Well, let's take an example.

419
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,050
The five-year strip is priced
at, about, $0.80 to the dollar.

420
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,920
OK?

421
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,280
So the price is
0.797, and that's

422
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,180
equal to $1 paid
five years later.

423
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,930
So therefore, it's $1
discounted back five years.

424
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,590
So I'm gonna use my little
r, and the zero comma five

425
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,610
indicates that it's today's
spot rate for borrowing

426
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,400
over a five-year horizon.

427
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,040
And it turns out that
when I solve for that,

428
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,980
I get a number that's 4.64%.

429
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,480
That's the rate of return,
the cost of capital,

430
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,640
the yield of that
five period horizon.

431
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,770
Any questions about this?

432
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,800
Yeah.

433
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,350
STUDENT: How do we do it,
maybe, if it was one that

434
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,039
was less than a year's horizon?

435
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,080
ANDREW LO: So if it's less
than a year's horizon,

436
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,254
then you basically have
to go the other way,

437
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,170
in terms of the power.

438
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,875
Right?

439
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,180
STUDENT: [? 1 over 1/2. ?]

440
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,170
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

441
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,340
Exactly.

442
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,900
That's right.

443
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
Yeah, that's it.

444
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,050
It's just a shorter time
horizon than a year.

445
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,900
Now, suppose that we
observe a bunch of these

446
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
as we do with the strips.

447
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,830
So in other words, you've
got a five-year rate,

448
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,080
you've got a 10-year rate,
you've got a two-year rate,

449
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,500
and so on.

450
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,270
What does that tell
us about the future?

451
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,360
Well, let's write
down the big R's.

452
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,480
Even though we don't see
them, we know that somehow,

453
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,430
implicitly, they're there.

454
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,790
So what are the relationships
between the little

455
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,070
r's and the big R's?

456
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,070
Well, you'll see something
really neat emerge out of this.

457
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,790
We'll start with
a one-year strip.

458
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,220
With a one-year strip,
the little r and the big R

459
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,700
are the same, because
it's only one year.

460
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,450
So there's a one-year big
R, a one-year little r,

461
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,420
and when you work
out the math, they're

462
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,060
actually equal to each other.

463
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,150
But now, when you go with
two years, three years, and t

464
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,110
years, it gets a little
bit more complicated.

465
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,390
Take a look at
what happens if you

466
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,780
take the price of the
one-year, and you divide that

467
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,570
into the price of the two-year.

468
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,050
These two securities-- the
one-year and the two-year--

469
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,360
they have the same F,
the same face value.

470
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,147
They pay $1,000 at maturity.

471
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,230
But one of them goes for
one year, and one of them

472
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,021
goes for two years.

473
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:04,910
What happens when
you take P 0,1,

474
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,700
and you divide that by P 0,2?

475
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,140
By the way, both of
those prices exist today.

476
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,980
Right?

477
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,040
For example, if you take
a look at the strips,

478
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,880
the price of P 0,1 is 0.967.

479
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,330
The price of P 0,2 is 0.927.

480
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,730
If I take the price of 1
divided by the price of 2,

481
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,550
what do I get?

482
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,050
Yeah.

483
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,299
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

484
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:32,090
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

485
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,930
I get 1 plus R2.

486
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,880
And so if I subtract
1 from that, I get R2.

487
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,340
So let's just go back.

488
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,980
I don't have a calculator with
me, but I'm sure all of you do.

489
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,010
Somebody do that division
for me, will you?

490
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,070
Can you take 0.967 and
divide that by 0.927?

491
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,990
What do you get?

492
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,090
0.967 divided by 0.927.

493
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,765
What's that?

494
00:21:58,765 --> 00:21:59,920
STUDENT: 1.04.

495
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,630
ANDREW LO: 1.04-- and
then, subtract 1 from that.

496
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,990
4%.

497
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,660
Actually, can you give me a
few more digits of accuracy?

498
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

499
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,478
ANDREW LO: What's that?

500
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:10,810
STUDENT: 4.314.

501
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,070
ANDREW LO: 4.314.

502
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,370
So it turns out that
in year 0, where

503
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,610
we have all of these
prices, we actually

504
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,050
have a forecast
for what big R2 is.

505
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,200
Big R2 in this case
is the borrowing cost

506
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,060
between year 1 and year 2.

507
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,070
But we're sitting at year 0.

508
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,460
So implicit in the price of a
two-year bond and a one-year

509
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,090
bond--

510
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,250
implicit in that is a forecast
of what the price is going

511
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,110
to be, what the
yield is going to be,

512
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,610
or what the borrowing
costs is going

513
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,220
to be between years 1 and 2.

514
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,900
In this case, 4.3% or so.

515
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,330
And that's a really
important observation.

516
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,380
If you plot these little r's on
a graph as a function of time,

517
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,680
you actually get a sense of
where the future big R's are

518
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,490
going to lie.

519
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,960
This plot, a plot of the
r's as a function of time,

520
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,320
is known as the term structure
of interest rates or the yield

521
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,540
curve, and it gives you a
sense of where future interest

522
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,160
rates are going to go.

523
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,450
If the curve is upward-sloping,
it says that as you go out

524
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,310
into longer maturities,
your average yield,

525
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,990
the geometric average
of all the big R's--

526
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,790
it's getting bigger
as time grows,

527
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,920
as the time horizon grows.

528
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,400
If it's downward-sloping,
it suggests

529
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,830
that future interest rates,
future big R's, are declining.

530
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,440
I want to show you what the
yield curve looks like today.

531
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,730
Now, it turns out that we don't
have a yield curve of strips

532
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,850
as readily available as a
yield curve that includes

533
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,660
coupon payments.

534
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,384
So I'm going to come
back to the distinction

535
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,300
a little bit later on.

536
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,270
We haven't talked
about coupon bonds yet,

537
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,580
but I just want to show you
what the yield curve is.

538
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,280
So I'm on the Bloomberg website.

539
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,470
This is publicly
available, so I don't have

540
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,110
a particular license for it.

541
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,690
It's the public version.

542
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,990
And if you click on market
data, and then click

543
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,240
on rates and bonds, you're going
to get this page right here.

544
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,380
So these are the different
US treasury securities,

545
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,790
the different horizons.

546
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,870
These are the coupons.

547
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,525
For less than a year, there
are no coupon payments,

548
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,610
so these are pure
discount bonds.

549
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,950
And there's the graph.

550
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,870
That's it.

551
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,910
That graph-- the green line is
showing you the future course

552
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,070
of interest rates.

553
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,990
It's extremely low today.

554
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,210
The scale is on the
left-hand access.

555
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,050
And by the way,
these are in percent.

556
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:12,610
So where we are today,
for a three-month rate,

557
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,740
is close to zero.

558
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,560
It's actually
three basis points,

559
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,201
three basis points for
a three-month T-bill.

560
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,200
What does that tell you?

561
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,686
What's the relationship
between price and the little r?

562
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:33,614
Yeah?

563
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:37,362
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

564
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:39,040
ANDREW LO: Well, that's right.

565
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,120
But how does that
yield get so low?

566
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,824
Yes?

567
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:45,995
STUDENT: Because the
price is extremely high.

568
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,620
ANDREW LO: The price
is extremely high.

569
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,161
That's right.

570
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:51,490
Price is equal to the
three-month pay-out divided

571
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,880
by 1 plus little r.

572
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,830
If little r ends up being
really, really tiny,

573
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,670
it's only because the
price is really high.

574
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,840
Why would the price be high?

575
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,870
STUDENT: Because US
treasuries are the safe thing

576
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,270
to own right now.

577
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,920
ANDREW LO: At least, that's
what many people think, exactly.

578
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,460
There is a really strong
flight to liquidity going on

579
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,310
in markets, as of today.

580
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,060
And how do you know
that it's as of today?

581
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,500
Well, take a look
at the difference

582
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,291
between the green line
and the orange line.

583
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,800
The orange line was
what it was yesterday.

584
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,100
You see, there's a difference.

585
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,490
There's a noticeable difference
on the short end that

586
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,400
means a lot of people are out
there buying treasury bills

587
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,700
now, probably as we speak.

588
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Maybe you ought to go and
buy some treasury bills.

589
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,830
People are scared.

590
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,930
And they're scared
because of all the things

591
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,990
that are going on in the
news, and this is exactly what

592
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,970
the Fed is trying to stave off.

593
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,790
So you're absolutely right.

594
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,250
The Fed is not worried
about the cost of borrowing.

595
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,930
They're worried
about whether or not

596
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,690
there's money out there
to be able to calm

597
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,410
the fears of market
participants.

598
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,126
Yeah?

599
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:02,606
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
two days ago

600
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:05,416
to today, [INAUDIBLE] probably
the Fed didn't cut the interest

601
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,070
rate once [INAUDIBLE].

602
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,500
They [INAUDIBLE].

603
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
ANDREW LO: That's right.

604
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,470
They might have to, so
that expectation actually

605
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,970
is built into these prices.

606
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,820
The market recognizes
that, and they're worried.

607
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,520
But think about that.

608
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,020
If the Fed has said that they're
going to be cutting rates--

609
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,310
possibly cutting rates
in the future, and yet,

610
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,270
the rate stays relatively
high going forward,

611
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,210
and rates go down
today, what that's

612
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,120
telling you is that the market
is being driven by a panic

613
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,360
reaction.

614
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,480
Now, rates are going to go up.

615
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,460
So the fact that you see the
market determining a yield

616
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,080
curve that's
upward-sloping-- that's

617
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,330
telling you that people
expect that rates

618
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,580
are going to go up, that
rates have to go up,

619
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,300
for one of two reasons.

620
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,410
And in fact, you can take a look
at the steepness of the yield

621
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,800
curve as telling you what
the market's expectations are

622
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,690
for how quickly rates
are going to go up

623
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,770
and where they're
going to go up.

624
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,090
So you have to look at
the x-axis a little bit

625
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,150
differently.

626
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,947
These are denominated
in years, so this

627
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:11,280
is three months, six months,
one year, two, three, four,

628
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,140
five, up to 10--

629
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,760
then, 15, 20, and 30.

630
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,490
So these are long-term rates.

631
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,930
And you can see that the yield
curve really goes up sharply

632
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,680
after the first three months.

633
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,260
There's a big
increase in the slope,

634
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,370
and then it becomes a
little bit more gradual.

635
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,980
That's a sign of a short-term
flight to quality or flight

636
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,060
to liquidity.

637
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,640
But the market
expects, over time

638
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,840
as things calm down, that
interest rates will go up,

639
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,030
for one of two reasons.

640
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,910
Either there are inflationary
pressures and that

641
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,370
will drive rates
up, or there are

642
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,500
going to be some economic
consequences of what's

643
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
happening today, and
that will ultimately

644
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,740
cause rates to go up.

645
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,215
Yeah.

646
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:02,680
STUDENT: What's happening
to the interest rates

647
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,660
outside of this case?

648
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,408
Because I'm from Argentina,
and when we have crises,

649
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:13,930
like [? internal ?]
interest rates go up,

650
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,780
because the probability
of default increases.

651
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,240
And now, I see here, it's
the other way around,

652
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,400
because they are not
considering it will be--

653
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
ANDREW LO: That's right.

654
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,570
It depends on the
nature of the crisis.

655
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,520
So in certain countries where
there is a financial crisis,

656
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,730
the typical reaction
of monetary authorities

657
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,280
is to flood the
market with cash,

658
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,070
because that's their reaction
to a liquidity crunch.

659
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,310
They want to reduce the
prospect of having a kind of run

660
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,900
on the banks, so they'll flood
the market with their currency.

661
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,630
When you do that, you
encourage inflation,

662
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,320
and that's why interest rates go
up in those kinds of economies.

663
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,220
The US, for better or for worse,
has shown a certain degree

664
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,330
of monetary restraint over the
years in that while they do

665
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,260
certainly cut interest rates--
and Alan Greenspan was very

666
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,850
active in this respect over
the last 10 or 15 years--

667
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,100
the fact is that
there has been more

668
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,840
measured control of monetary
policy in the United States.

669
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,810
What that means is that
this is a symptom more

670
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,820
of a short-term cash crunch.

671
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,980
People are just putting
money in treasury bills

672
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,430
for the short term
without any expectation

673
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,880
that the Fed is going to
dramatically increase the money

674
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,690
supply.

675
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,190
If they did that,
you would then see

676
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,500
interest rates rise,
because inflation would

677
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,210
be much more of a problem.

678
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,020
OK.

679
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,740
Yes?

680
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,534
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
European Central Bank?

681
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:44,200
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

682
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,740
STUDENT: --normally raises the
interest rates [INAUDIBLE]..

683
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
ANDREW LO: That's right.

684
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,870
They do raise it, and that's
one of the reasons why

685
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,140
the Fed did not cut it.

686
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,000
It's because they are
concerned with inflation.

687
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,100
And so if they ended up
cutting interest rates,

688
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,790
while that might stave off
certain credit crunches,

689
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,958
that would actually
encourage inflation.

690
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,398
STUDENT: So inflation does
encourage higher interest

691
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:10,840
rates, but what is the
[? advantage ?] of it?

692
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,390
ANDREW LO: Inflation causes--

693
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,210
so I see the confusion, and
let me make a distinction.

694
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,640
There are two different interest
rates that are going on.

695
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,240
There is the market
rate of interest,

696
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,560
which is what this is.

697
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,670
And then, there is the Fed's
stated federal funds rate,

698
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,480
which is what it
charges its other member

699
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,070
banks for borrowing.

700
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,120
The Fed is able to control
what it charges to other banks.

701
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,430
The Fed cannot
control these rates.

702
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,810
So the interest rates that
you're thinking about, that--

703
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,420
for example, when
the ECB raises rates,

704
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,090
they do so, so as to discourage
lots of borrowing and lending,

705
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,500
and reduce the amount of
money that's in circulation.

706
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,350
And that decreases
business activity,

707
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,860
which then reduces the
pressure on inflation.

708
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,680
OK?

709
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,240
So that's what they
do in response,

710
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,570
but they don't control the
interest rate determined

711
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,380
by the market for
treasury bills.

712
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,830
And in these interest
rates, these 30-year rates,

713
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,230
as opposed to overnight
borrowing rates and Fed funds

714
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,780
rates, these rates
give you a sense

715
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,260
of what the market is
expecting over time.

716
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,070
[? Megan, ?] do you
have a question?

717
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:25,440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] As it
cuts the interest rates,

718
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,810
[INAUDIBLE] had an impact
[INAUDIBLE] the actual banks

719
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:43,570
that [? spread ?] over time
[INAUDIBLE] to stave off that

720
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,600
credit crunch--

721
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,850
ANDREW LO: Well, that's right.

722
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,140
I think that when you
think about the instruments

723
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,220
that the Fed has for managing
monetary policy, credit,

724
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,540
and liquidity, it's
actually pretty minimal.

725
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,130
I mean, they have one variable.

726
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,630
You know?

727
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,575
Imagine flying a mirror plane
and you get one control.

728
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:03,450
You pick the control.

729
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,280
You want to be able to control
the wheels, or the ailerons,

730
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,891
or the--?

731
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:09,910
It's very, very hard
to try to manage

732
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,280
the economy with one variable.

733
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,380
Now, the Fed has other
policy instruments

734
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,920
that are a little bit more
complex, like the discount

735
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,630
window, like moral suasion.

736
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,250
The New York Fed can
go to these banks

737
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,680
and say, what are
you guys doing?

738
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,510
Are you nuts?

739
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:29,080
But what's going on now is that
because the crisis has reached

740
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,990
such an extraordinary
level, they're not

741
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,250
worrying about interest rates.

742
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,791
They're actually
trying to figure out

743
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,390
how to stave off some
kind of mass panic.

744
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,910
And so getting directly
involved with AIG,

745
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,910
getting in discussions with
Bear Stearns and JP Morgan--

746
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,600
they really have no choice.

747
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,390
And it's a signal of, sort
of, how desperate times are.

748
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,480
One last question?

749
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,086
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] My
understanding is first

750
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:55,877
that the Fed is not a
federal organization.

751
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:58,118
It's made up of a
number of banks,

752
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:00,309
so that it's not a
government entity,

753
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,600
but the government has
appointed representatives to it.

754
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,790
And at the same time,
where does the Fed

755
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,380
get all their money from?

756
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,830
ANDREW LO: Well, this
is more of a question

757
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,850
that you probably should be
asking your macro instructor.

758
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,560
I'm happy to answer
it, but the macro folks

759
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,290
may disagree with what
I'm about to tell you.

760
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,120
The Fed is a government
organization.

761
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,310
It's separate from the
government in the sense

762
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,340
that it's not a
political organization,

763
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,010
but it does have the full
backing of the government,

764
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,770
and it has powers
granted to it as part

765
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,060
of the various
legal proposals that

766
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,750
were developed to create
the Federal Reserve system.

767
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,520
Where does the Fed
get its money from?

768
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,350
It gets its money
from the treasury.

769
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,870
So the Fed can
actually engage in what

770
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,030
are called open
market operations

771
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,870
and can actually contract
or expand money supply,

772
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,199
based upon what the
treasury will allow it to do

773
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,630
or will work with it to do.

774
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,490
And the Fed controls
the borrowing rate

775
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,780
among all of the member
banks, and actually, all

776
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,532
of the major banks are members.

777
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:05,740
So it's not like you can
start up your bank tomorrow.

778
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,480
In order to start a bank
and deal with the public,

779
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,870
you need a bank charter,
and the bank charter

780
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,370
is issued by the government.

781
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,020
And once you're part
of that network,

782
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,792
you are part of the
Federal Reserve system.

783
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:19,155
STUDENT: Aren't they
losing money from, say,

784
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:20,530
the fallout of
these [? banks? ?]

785
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,810
Aren't they, in essence,
losing also themselves?

786
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,760
ANDREW LO: Well, they're
not trying to make money.

787
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,610
That's not their objective.

788
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,400
And if they're losing
money, ultimately, it's

789
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,080
not them that is losing money.

790
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,580
It is-- who?

791
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,564
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

792
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:35,230
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

793
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,130
We're losing money.

794
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,411
It's government-sponsored.

795
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,160
So that's one of the
reasons why, I think,

796
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,544
the Fed has been so
concerned about bailing out

797
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:43,210
Lehman Brothers.

798
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,690
And even the bailout of
Bear Stearns, which did not

799
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,690
necessarily cost them anything--

800
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,390
the fact that they were willing
to provide this backstop

801
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,520
guarantee in order to
make the deal happen--

802
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,430
that implicit
insurance is a cost

803
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,230
that we ultimately
end up paying.

804
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,924
They got a huge amount
of heat for that,

805
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:03,340
and that's one of the reasons
why they decided to back off

806
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,589
from the Lehman Brothers deal.

807
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:08,320
It's because they would have
gotten huge, huge backlash

808
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,130
from that kind of an event.

809
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,340
Now, AIG-- the fact
that they went and did

810
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,380
something there
tells you something

811
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,930
about how important
AIG is, or what

812
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,160
repercussions might have come
about if they had let AIG fail.

813
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,930
So that says more,
not about the Fed,

814
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,090
but more about the
situation with AIG

815
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,460
and the specific
financial transactions

816
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,610
that they were engaged in.

817
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,110
OK.

818
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,280
Let me continue on.

819
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,130
And sorry, I want to hold off
questions for a little bit

820
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,720
longer, but I do want to cover
some additional material.

821
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,550
So this is the
expression that we just

822
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,430
described for getting a sense
of future interest rates.

823
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,030
And we saw, given
today's yield curve,

824
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,310
that there is some sense
that interest rates are

825
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,660
going to rise.

826
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,300
But it turns out that
the yield curve contains

827
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,870
all sorts of information, not
just about one-year rates,

828
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,530
but in fact, about
multi-year rates.

829
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,270
This is a clear example.

830
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,190
This is one example.

831
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,580
And it turns out that
there's another example that

832
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,950
makes this a little
bit clearer, which is

833
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,130
future rates and forward rates.

834
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,560
These are all very
confusing terminology,

835
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,960
unless you sit down and
read through it carefully,

836
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,780
so I would encourage you all
to do that after this lecture.

837
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,730
There's a lot of
notation in this lecture,

838
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,010
but not a lot of
conceptual challenges.

839
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,690
Because all the
conceptual challenges,

840
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,570
we derived when we talked
about net present value rules.

841
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,900
So most of this is just lots
of notation and terminology.

842
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,700
So let me describe
the terminology here.

843
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,470
At date zero, if we focus
on the price of a bond,

844
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,670
that matures at time t minus 1.

845
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,570
And at date zero, if we focus
on the price of a bond that

846
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,860
matures at day t, and we
take the ratio of those two,

847
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,480
then it turns out, we're
getting an implicit forecast

848
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,650
of the future one-year spot
rate between t minus 1 and t.

849
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,150
Right?

850
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,370
That's just what we did with r2.

851
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,580
So this is true in
general, and there's

852
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,390
a name for this forecast.

853
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,800
It's called,
today's forward rate

854
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,090
between dates t minus 1 and t.

855
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:23,040
It is a forecast of
the future spot rate

856
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,320
between dates t minus 1 and t.

857
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,890
OK?

858
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,230
We don't know what that
spot rate is going to be,

859
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,036
in general.

860
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:31,410
We don't know what future
interest rates are going to be.

861
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,550
It's uncertain.

862
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,760
But today, implicit
in today's prices

863
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,330
is a forecast of
that unknown future,

864
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,780
and we're going to call that
forecast the forward rate.

865
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,490
That is really meant to convey
that it is a rate that we

866
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,560
observe today, and it is meant
to capture the market's best

867
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,750
guess about what the
future spot rate will be.

868
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,670
OK?

869
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,270
So this is, I know, a
little bit confusing.

870
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,030
And just to give you a
summary of all the notation

871
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,950
and terminology
we've defined today--

872
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,200
we have a spot rate.

873
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,860
A spot rate is the rate
that you have to pay

874
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:20,220
or that you will earn on the
spot, for a period of time.

875
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,980
So you've got the
two-year spot rate today.

876
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,520
You've also got future
spot rates, which you

877
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,070
don't know and don't observe.

878
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,810
You also have a forward rate,
which you do observe today.

879
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,530
And the forward rate
is a rate that applies

880
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,560
over some period in the future.

881
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,820
And it's today's best guess of
what that future rate will be.

882
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:52,130
Now, we can see the
implicit forecasts

883
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,970
that are in the yield curve.

884
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,730
The one-year spot
rate today also

885
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,470
happens to be equal to
the one-year forward rate.

886
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,350
However, if you take a look
at the two-year spot rate

887
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,380
and compare that with
the one-year spot rate,

888
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,190
you can compute the
one-year forward rate

889
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,920
for borrowing between
years 1 and 2.

890
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,770
And similarly, if you compare
the four-year spot rate

891
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,810
with the three-year
spot rate, you

892
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,240
will be able to figure out
what the forward rate is

893
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,340
for borrowing one
year between 3 and 4.

894
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,282
OK?

895
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,990
Now, you might think
this is complicated.

896
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,410
Believe me.

897
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,243
It gets even more
complicated when you think

898
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:41,310
about multi-year forward rates.

899
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,860
So suppose I asked you, what
is the two-year borrowing

900
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,770
rate, three years from now?

901
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,010
Then, what you would do is
to take a five-year bond

902
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,440
and compare that to
a three-year bond,

903
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,520
and that would give you the
two-year forward rate today,

904
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,300
starting in year 3.

905
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,370
OK?

906
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,700
Lots of different rates.

907
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,030
This is, again, why I've
told you, every time you

908
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,890
have a problem like
this, draw a timeline.

909
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,130
Otherwise, you're going to
get hopelessly confused.

910
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,580
Now, in general, you
can define forward

911
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,220
interest rates between any two
points in time, between time t1

912
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,710
and t2.

913
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,120
And so the typical
forward transaction

914
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,590
is one where today, we
agree to do a deal that

915
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,530
starts at some point
t1 in the future

916
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,950
and concludes at some
point t2 in the future.

917
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,620
And that's known as a
forward transaction.

918
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,260
It's a transaction that
we agree upon today,

919
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,260
to engage in sometime
in the future.

920
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,700
Now, I want to work
through an example,

921
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,770
because this is a bit confusing.

922
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,930
So let me show you
how this might work,

923
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,860
and why the whole idea of
forward rates and future spot

924
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,650
rates is so important.

925
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,130
A practical example is that you
are the chief financial officer

926
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,100
of a multinational
company based in the US,

927
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,390
and you're going to
get $10 million a year

928
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,935
from now, from
operations overseas.

929
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:13,060
And it's going to come back
in the form of dollars,

930
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,643
but it's not going
to come back today.

931
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:17,480
It's going to come back
exactly one year from today.

932
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,104
Now, you've got to pay
dividends two years from today.

933
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:23,020
So you're going to use
that money that's going

934
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,070
to come in a year from now.

935
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,790
And then, at the end of year
2, you're going to pay it out.

936
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,580
And so you don't want to
take that money next year

937
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,870
and fool around with it.

938
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,000
You don't know what interest
rates are going to be.

939
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,860
But what you'd like
to be able to do

940
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:43,020
is, today, lock in a rate of
return between years 1 and 2.

941
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,710
Because you know that you're
going to need to get that money

942
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,140
invested in year
1, and you'd like

943
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,750
to be able to pay
it out in year 2.

944
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,274
And you want to
do that all today.

945
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:55,190
So how do you do that?

946
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,490
Well, you go to the
financial markets,

947
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,177
and you look at the yield curve.

948
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,760
And you see what the
one-year rate is,

949
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,140
and what the two-year rate is.

950
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,620
And what you get from
looking at the newspaper is,

951
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:13,320
the one-year rate is 5%,
and the two-year rate is 7%.

952
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,050
Question-- is 7% a spot
rate, forward rate,

953
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,787
or future spot rate?

954
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:19,620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

955
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,147
ANDREW LO: It's a
spot rate of what?

956
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:22,980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

957
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,771
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

958
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:26,310
It is today's spot rate between
now and two years from now.

959
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,480
It's a two-year spot rate.

960
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,470
Right.

961
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,440
What you care about,
though, for the example

962
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,152
I just gave you, is what?

963
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:36,130
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

964
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,000
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

965
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,370
You care about the one-year
spot rate in one year,

966
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,460
the future one-year
spot rate, which--

967
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,110
you don't know what
it's going to be.

968
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,430
That's uncertain.

969
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,850
But you do have the--

970
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,571
what rate do you have today?

971
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:52,570
The forward rate, right.

972
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,440
You have a forward rate.

973
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,190
Because you've got the
two-year spot rate,

974
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,080
and you've got the
one-year spot rate.

975
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:03,620
So when you compare the two,
implicitly in those two rates

976
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,780
is the forecast of the
future one-year spot rate

977
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,250
or today's forward rate
between years 1 and 2.

978
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,130
All right.

979
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,890
Now, let's get to brass tacks.

980
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,860
How do you go about locking
in the rates between years 1

981
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,680
and 2?

982
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,620
Well, here's a really cool
transaction that you can do.

983
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:32,980
Today, borrow $9.524
million for a year.

984
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,430
How do you know you can do that?

985
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,059
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

986
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:38,850
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

987
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,810
You've got the one-year
interest rate at 5%.

988
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,240
So if that's really
a market rate,

989
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,656
that means that you should be
able to borrow at that rate.

990
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:45,360
OK?

991
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,330
So when you're borrowing
money, what are you doing?

992
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,914
You're-- are you buying a bond?

993
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:53,830
You're selling a bond.

994
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,890
You're issuing a bond.

995
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,681
Right.

996
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,180
OK.

997
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,499
So you borrowed $9.52
million dollars today.

998
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:01,040
Now, in a minute,
I'll explain to you

999
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,100
why that number is so weird.

1000
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:11,610
Then, after you get
the money today,

1001
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,600
I'm going to ask you to put
it into the two-year bond.

1002
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:24,030
So you got $9.52
million in cash,

1003
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,442
and you put it into
a two-year bond.

1004
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:27,900
So let's take a
look at what you've

1005
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,834
done with that transaction.

1006
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,880
The outcome looks like this.

1007
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,864
In year zero, you've
borrowed 9.52,

1008
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,280
and then you've
taken the proceeds

1009
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,780
and you've bought
a bond at 9.52.

1010
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:54,060
So in fact, your net
expenditures is nothing.

1011
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,890
You borrowed money,
you took that money,

1012
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,140
and you bought something else.

1013
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,136
You've loaned it out.

1014
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:00,510
You borrowed money for one
year, and you've loaned it out

1015
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,470
for two years.

1016
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,730
That's what you've done.

1017
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,190
So today, you
actually have zero,

1018
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,910
in terms of your
assets and liabilities.

1019
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,620
Now, let's see what
happens next year.

1020
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:18,440
In one year's time, that 9.52
to magically turns into 10,

1021
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,810
but it's a negative 10,
meaning you borrowed 9.52.

1022
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,750
You've got to pay back
9.52 with interest.

1023
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,840
How much interest?

1024
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,659
5%.

1025
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:30,700
That's the one-year rate.

1026
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,420
So now, you actually have
to pay back $10 million.

1027
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,770
Well, it just so happens,
you have $10 million.

1028
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,372
How?

1029
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:40,580
From the money that's coming
in from your subsidiary,

1030
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,040
that repatriation
amount of money.

1031
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,650
So you take that $10
million, you pay it back,

1032
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,450
and you're done with that
part of your portfolio.

1033
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,670
What do you have left?

1034
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,700
What you have left
is a bond that

1035
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,780
will pay you money in the year
after that, between years 1

1036
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,070
and 2.

1037
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,080
And there you go.

1038
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,080
You get paid $10.9 million.

1039
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,140
You've done all of
this transaction today.

1040
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,710
You've locked in
the rates today.

1041
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,900
OK?

1042
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,400
Yeah?

1043
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,780
STUDENT: You locked in the
one-year spot rate [INAUDIBLE]??

1044
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,850
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1045
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,460
Well, you're locking
in the forward rate,

1046
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,480
which is the forecast--

1047
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:24,980
right.

1048
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,340
It's what the market expects
the future one-year spot

1049
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,210
rate will be.

1050
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,550
Now, that's a good
point that you bring up,

1051
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,540
which is, let's
say that in year 1,

1052
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,270
it turns out that at
that point in time,

1053
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,900
the one-year spot rate is 7%.

1054
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,340
Are you happy or are you sad?

1055
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,225
Some people say said,
some people say happy.

1056
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:01,080
If the one-year spot rate
one year from now is 7%,

1057
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,827
and you've done
this deal already--

1058
00:48:02,827 --> 00:48:04,020
STUDENT: You're happy.

1059
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,020
ANDREW LO: You're happy.

1060
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,700
That's right.

1061
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,930
Because, what are you
getting on your portfolio?

1062
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,950
9%.

1063
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,480
Now, wait a minute.

1064
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,860
How do you get 9%?

1065
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,020
I thought that I told you
the two-year rate was 7%.

1066
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,595
I'm purposely confusing
you, so I'm hoping it works.

1067
00:48:25,595 --> 00:48:27,470
And then, I'm going to
try to un-confuse you,

1068
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,590
and I hope that works, too.

1069
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,960
5% is the one-year spot rate.

1070
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,380
7% is the two-year spot rate.

1071
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,452
Yeah.

1072
00:48:36,452 --> 00:48:38,992
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1073
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:39,700
ANDREW LO: Right.

1074
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,960
That's right.

1075
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,230
The rate between years
1 and 2 is around 9%.

1076
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,060
And the reason it's
got to be that way

1077
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,280
is, the 7% that I told you--

1078
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,239
that's a two-year rate.

1079
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:53,738
Right?

1080
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:55,190
That's the average of two years.

1081
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,570
But you know what the
rate is the first year.

1082
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,550
The first year rate is 5%.

1083
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,300
So if something averages
to 7% over 2 years,

1084
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,130
but the first year
is 5, the second year

1085
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,410
has got to be greater than 7.

1086
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,950
Otherwise, the
average can't be 7.

1087
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,870
In fact, the second year rate--

1088
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,890
the one year rate between
years 1 and 2 is around 9%.

1089
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:22,360
And so that's why if when you
arrive at the end of year 1,

1090
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,250
ready to borrow
for one more year,

1091
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,590
and you've already
locked in a 9% rate,

1092
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,280
you are pretty happy that
the rate at that time is 7.

1093
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,620
However, if I told you that
the rate at that time was 15,

1094
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,740
you'll be kicking yourself,
because you locked

1095
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,425
in a 9% rate, and yet it's 15%.

1096
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,440
So there's room for regret
as well as celebration,

1097
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,310
depending on what the
market is going to do.

1098
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,030
But the point is
that in year zero,

1099
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,590
I don't know what
it's going to be.

1100
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,390
And I'm not a
hedge fund manager.

1101
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,200
I'm not a trader.

1102
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,784
I don't care--

1103
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,949
I don't want to make a bet
on future interest rates.

1104
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,790
I just want to get
this problem solved.

1105
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,340
And right now,
today, I can actually

1106
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,860
solve my problem
of figuring out how

1107
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,650
to invest my money
between years 1 and 2

1108
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,400
by doing this very simple
transaction in open markets

1109
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,300
with market-determined
interest rates.

1110
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,270
And I know, as long as the
interest rates are not nuts,

1111
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,300
then I'm getting
a reasonable deal.

1112
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,516
Yeah?

1113
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,530
STUDENT: This is one of the main
[? things that you can do. ?]

1114
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:26,258
Could you please [INAUDIBLE] is
it even similar in the same--

1115
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:29,302
at the end of year 1,
I get my 10 million,

1116
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:35,354
put it in [INAUDIBLE],, because
it's pretty much [INAUDIBLE]..

1117
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:36,020
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

1118
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,395
But the problem
is that you don't

1119
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:39,820
know what that one-year
T-bill rate will be,

1120
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,950
whereas right now,
you know that it's 9%.

1121
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,320
Right now, you know
it's 9%, and it

1122
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,810
seems like a pretty good
deal to go ahead and do it.

1123
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,530
If, however, you think that
interest rates are going

1124
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,790
to go up much more
than the market thinks,

1125
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,590
then you may want to wait.

1126
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,040
But now, you're becoming an
interest rate speculator.

1127
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,390
You're taking a risk.

1128
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,570
And as a CFO, that's
generally not your job and not

1129
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,631
your level of competency.

1130
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,130
Right?

1131
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,148
You're not there trying to
forecast interest rates.

1132
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,146
Yeah?

1133
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:14,570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1134
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,570
ANDREW LO: That's right.

1135
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,220
The 9.524 is the present
value of $10 million today,

1136
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,900
at the rate of 5% interest.

1137
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,520
So the way that I did this--

1138
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,010
and you know, this is
a good illustration

1139
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,140
of what I've been
telling you about finance

1140
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,730
not being a spectator sport.

1141
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,470
I suspect that all
of you understand

1142
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,110
the lectures that I've given
so far about present value,

1143
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,420
about time value of money,
and the fact that you've got

1144
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,711
to use the right exchange rate.

1145
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,500
It all is pretty
straightforward.

1146
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,890
But putting it into practice is
not so easy, at least for me.

1147
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,320
I don't find this
example so transparent.

1148
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,840
You have to actually spend
some time thinking about it,

1149
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,370
thinking about where the
money is coming from,

1150
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,080
where the money is
going, how much money

1151
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,440
you have at any point in time.

1152
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,040
But when you work it
out, it all makes sense.

1153
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,220
And so I would
encourage all of you

1154
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,350
to spend some time
working this out.

1155
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,021
OK, question?

1156
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:05,520
Yeah.

1157
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:12,940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1158
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,380
ANDREW LO: Yes,
there are ways you

1159
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,720
can engage in a forward
contract, of course.

1160
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,460
So you don't have to do this.

1161
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,520
But the fact is doing
this is so simple.

1162
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,720
Why not?

1163
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,960
And if it's simple, most
likely, it'll be cheap.

1164
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,030
If it's complex, that's when
you're going to pay for it.

1165
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,530
Right?

1166
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,590
So I'm happy to structure a
derivative product for you.

1167
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:34,030
Let's call it a
structured product

1168
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,571
that we trade over
the counter, where

1169
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:38,440
I offer you a forward
contract, one-year borrowing,

1170
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,660
with certain terms and
privileges, and so on.

1171
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,521
And by the time
we're done, I'm going

1172
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:44,770
to charge you a transaction
fee of-- oh, I don't know,

1173
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,720
maybe 5%.

1174
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,990
Versus, you buy a two-year
bond and a one-year bill,

1175
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,020
and you're done.

1176
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,520
Right?

1177
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,260
So that's the difference.

1178
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,450
It's really the ease with which
you can implement the strategy.

1179
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,270
All of you right now, today--

1180
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,410
all of you can do this.

1181
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,610
You can do this.

1182
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,500
You can actually trade
in these markets.

1183
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,110
Set up a brokerage account,
trade these treasury

1184
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,540
instruments, and
do this yourself.

1185
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,100
In fact, you can do this online.

1186
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,660
So it's very, very simple.

1187
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,935

00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:19,350
Well, that's the hard part.

Yeah.

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,910
First, get a million dollars.

1197
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,610
So yes, that's the hard part.

1198
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,140
OK.

1199
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,850
So now, this transaction
today locks you

1200
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,720
into a 9% rate
between years 1 and 2.

1201
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,490
And so going back
to the question

1202
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,977
that [? Anan ?]
raised, should you

1203
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:45,310
do this or should you just wait?

1204
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,380
Well, it depends.

1205
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,560
Do you feel lucky?

1206
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,210
Do you think you can
do better than 9%?

1207
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,627
I mean, today, 9%
looks wonderful,

1208
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:56,918
but that's not with the rate
you're going to get today.

1209
00:53:56,918 --> 00:53:58,840
In fact, if we go back
to the Bloomberg site,

1210
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,940
you can see what kind
of rate you would lock

1211
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,280
in today between years 1 and 2.

1212
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,390
And I promise you,
it's nowhere near 9%.

1213
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,010
And so again, you
might actually say--

1214
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,620
in today's low interest
rate environment,

1215
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,290
you might say, look,
I think that inflation

1216
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,950
is going to heat up a great
deal over the next year,

1217
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:23,470
and therefore what's implicit in
today's forecast of future spot

1218
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,780
rates is lower than I
think it ought to be.

1219
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,470
So I'm going to hold off.

1220
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,125
That's a bet.

1221
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,750
And so you're going
to take some risks.

1222
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,431
That's all.

1223
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,930
And for those people who are
good at taking risks like that,

1224
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:35,888
they end up doing well.

1225
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:38,830
For those who don't,
they end up losing out

1226
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,789
on good opportunities.

1227
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:44,330
There's another example that
I'd like you to look at and work

1228
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:45,260
through on your own.

1229
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,000
It's very similar
to the first one,

1230
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,760
but it just gives you practice
in thinking about timelines,

1231
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,190
moving money back
and forth, and trying

1232
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:57,380
to understand how to structure
the payoffs in order to satisfy

1233
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,370
certain consumption patterns.

1234
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,060
So if you look at this
example and work it through,

1235
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,150
that will give you more
practice on how to deal

1236
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,150
with these transactions.

1237
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,930
Now, if there are no more
questions about pure discount

1238
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,740
bonds, I want to turn to the
more general case of coupon

1239
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,350
bonds.

1240
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,730
These are bonds that
pay off coupons.

1241
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,700
And really, the theory
behind coupon bonds

1242
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,660
is virtually identical to that
of discount bonds, in the sense

1243
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,780
that you can always
look at a coupon bond

1244
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,480
as a package of discount bonds.

1245
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,850
Right?

1246
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,740
That's, sort of, the
opposite of a strip.

1247
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,980
A strip takes a coupon
bond and breaks it up

1248
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,310
into what look like
little discount bonds.

1249
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,250
Well, if you think about
what a coupon bond is,

1250
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,691
it's really just a
collection of discount bonds

1251
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:52,690
at different maturities.

1252
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,210
That's the way to
think about it.

1253
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,740
Here's a simple example.

1254
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,550
A three-year bond
with a 5% coupon

1255
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,050
is going to look like this.

1256
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,721
It's going to pay 50,
50, and then 1,050.

1257
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:07,720
Now, as I mentioned, there
are some coupon bonds

1258
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,730
that pay semiannually.

1259
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,730
So when they say that
there's a coupon of 3%,

1260
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,980
it's 3% every six months.

1261
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,540
So you have to take
that into account

1262
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,280
when you're computing
the present values

1263
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,480
of these objects.

1264
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,310
How do we do it?

1265
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:25,660
Exactly the same way as we
do for pure discount bonds.

1266
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,380
Take the coupons, each of
them, and discount them back

1267
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:35,040
to the present, using either
the big R's or the little r's.

1268
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,200
Either way, you ought
to get the same answer,

1269
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,150
because the little r's are
simply the geometric averages

1270
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,360
of the big R's.

1271
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,650
OK?

1272
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,390
However, instead of
using the little r's

1273
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:53,890
for the different
payments, coupon bonds

1274
00:56:53,890 --> 00:57:01,680
are often quoted with a
single number that is a yield.

1275
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,360
So the theoretically correct
way to write the price

1276
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,910
is given up there.

1277
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:09,500
P0 is equal to C,
all the coupons,

1278
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,350
divided by the
appropriate big R's.

1279
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,320
Or we could replace every
one of those big R's

1280
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,480
with the appropriate little r.

1281
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,590
By appropriate little r, I mean,
little r 0,1, little r 0,2,

1282
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,750
too little r 0,3--

1283
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,470
each of those.

1284
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,900
But we can also
calculate an average

1285
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,130
of all of those little r's
and just use one variable.

1286
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,590
And to simplify notation, I'm
going to give it a completely

1287
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:43,670
different symbol, Y, and say, ,
what is that single number, Y,

1288
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:47,960
that will give me the
price of the bond?

1289
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,970
And that Y is known as the
particular bond's yield.

1290
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,870
It is the single
interest rate which,

1291
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:00,110
if interest rates were
constant throughout time,

1292
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,760
would make the present value of
all the coupons and principal

1293
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,610
equal to the current price.

1294
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,560
So if you think
about a mortgage,

1295
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,860
and you ask the question,
if the mortgage rate

1296
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:20,430
is 5%, what is the
value of the loan,

1297
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,590
that's exactly this
expression right here.

1298
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:29,886
Now, obviously, when you get a
fixed rate mortgage of 5.89%,

1299
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:31,760
you know that the interest
rate is not really

1300
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,710
going to be 5.98% forever.

1301
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,840
The interest rate
changes every year.

1302
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,750
But that 5.98% is an average
of the 30-year period where

1303
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,360
you're going to be borrowing
that mortgage money.

1304
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,590
So you can think of this coupon
bond in exactly the same way.

1305
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,010
We quote this
number Y as a yield.

1306
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,890
Sometimes, we talk about
yield instead of prices.

1307
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:56,690
But the way that we
figure out the yield

1308
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,330
is, we take this
30-year bond that

1309
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,840
pays 5% a year,
we auction it off,

1310
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,940
and we figure out
what the price is.

1311
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,470
Given the price, we
can find the yield.

1312
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,850
Finding the yield is not
so easy in this case,

1313
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:18,300
because in this case, unlike
just taking a simple geometric

1314
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,750
average, which is what we did
to calculate the little r's from

1315
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,530
the big R's--

1316
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:26,830
in this case, in
order to find the Y,

1317
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,760
we actually have to
solve an equation that

1318
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,080
can be highly non-linear.

1319
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,480
In fact, it's a polynomial.

1320
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,230
It's a t-th order polynomial.

1321
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,350
And for those of you high
school math team jocks,

1322
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:45,850
you'll remember that when
you've got a t-th order

1323
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:49,930
polynomial, first of all,
you have a lot of solutions.

1324
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,280
How many solutions do
you typically have?

1325
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,500
t.

1326
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,250
And of those solutions,
how many of them

1327
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,067
are guaranteed to
be real numbers?

1328
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:04,010
Right.

1329
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,740
There's no guarantee that
any of them are real.

1330
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,690
Now, you might ask, what
do you mean by real?

1331
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,790
Well, if you're asking me,
you don't need to know.

1332
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,400
[LAUGHTER] Don't-- don't.

1333
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,370
It means numbers that
we encounter in reality.

1334
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,409
Let's put it that way.

1335
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:20,450
It turns out that there
are numbers that actually

1336
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,310
don't exist in reality.

1337
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,170
They're called complex numbers.

1338
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:28,130
And they are quite complex,
so I won't talk about them.

1339
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,004
But these kinds of equations--

1340
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:31,670
it turns out that
they're not guaranteed

1341
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,950
to even have real solutions.

1342
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,240
Now, it turns out
that for bonds,

1343
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,640
where the coupon
payments are all positive

1344
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,800
and the principle
is all positive,

1345
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,500
it turns out in that
very restrictive--

1346
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,710
and the price is positive.

1347
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:49,300
It turns out in those cases, you
actually do get a real number--

1348
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,340
at least, one real number.

1349
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,900
The problem is
that in some cases,

1350
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,520
you get multiple real numbers.

1351
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,280
And then, it's very, very
hard to figure out which yield

1352
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,621
is the correct one to use.

1353
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,370
The only reason I'm
telling you about this

1354
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,940
is because it turns out
as a matter of convention,

1355
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:09,100
very often, people will quote
these little Y yields when

1356
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,774
they talk about coupon bonds.

1357
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:12,190
But the way to
think about that is

1358
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,660
to think about the
price, which is

1359
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,780
the present value of the coupon
payments as a present discount

1360
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,400
value of the interest that
really applies between today

1361
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,810
and date t.

1362
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:25,360
In fact, in order to do this
present value calculation,

1363
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,070
you need not just
one interest rate.

1364
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,710
How many interest
rates do you need?

1365
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,180
t, right?

1366
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,030
You're at year zero,
and you've got payments

1367
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:37,520
for every single
year between 1 and t.

1368
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,838
So you need interest rates
that apply between 0 and 1, 0

1369
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:43,260
and 2, 0 and 3, and so on.

1370
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,440
You need t interest
rates or exchange rates.

1371
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:46,940
Right?

1372
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,700
Or exchanges between
different dates.

1373
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,850
But now, the yield is
important because it

1374
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:57,170
allows us to quote the
pseudo rate of return

1375
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,070
of this bond in a single number.

1376
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:06,860
And very often, people will
plot the Y's as a function

1377
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,810
of the horizon of these bonds.

1378
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,200
So when I showed you
that yield curve--

1379
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,370
let me get that back.

1380
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:17,720
Whoops.

1381
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,470
I just had it.

1382
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,460
Let's take a look at this again.

1383
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:32,190
These treasury bonds from
years 2 to years 30--

1384
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,210
those have coupon payments,
and those are the coupon rates.

1385
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:41,040
And they have prices,
and they have yields.

1386
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:47,210
So what's plotted here
is not the little r.

1387
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:50,870
It's the Y for the coupon bonds.

1388
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,990
And so the reason that
they're not the same

1389
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:57,620
is because the yields,
the little Y's, depend

1390
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,680
on the coupon payments.

1391
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,150
And really strictly
speaking, we don't

1392
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,000
care about coupon payments when
we look at time to maturity.

1393
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,749
We just want to know,
what is the interest

1394
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:11,130
rate between 0 and 1, 0 and 2,
0 and 3, 0 and 5, and so on.

1395
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,670
But this is a
reasonable proxy as long

1396
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,130
as the coupons
don't look too crazy

1397
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,240
and are not too different
from each other.

1398
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,369
And you can see that the
coupons are all, sort of,

1399
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,410
in the same neighborhood.

1400
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:25,340
Some of them are
2.3% versus 4.5%,

1401
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,600
but they're not so different.

1402
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,630
So this gives us an indication
of what the strip's yield

1403
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,750
curve would look like.

1404
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,950
Here's an example of
the historical yield

1405
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,650
curve for US
Treasury securities,

1406
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,560
and let me just show you a plot.

1407
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,720
They move around a lot.

1408
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,330
So these yield curves
tell us something

1409
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,270
about the average
interest rate across

1410
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,020
various different maturities.

1411
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,440
So if you look at
the yellow line,

1412
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,490
that's a one-year
yield over time.

1413
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,580
So this is not the
yield curve anymore.

1414
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,250
This is a plot of
the time series

1415
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,960
of one-year yields over time.

1416
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,360
And you can see that starting
when the sample began in 1982,

1417
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:31,450
the one-year yield for
US Treasury bills is 12%.

1418
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,450
12% back in 1982--

1419
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:39,730
and there is a point at which
one of the longer maturity

1420
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:44,410
instruments reaches
a peak of 16% or 17%.

1421
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:48,040
Remember, I told you, I
was looking to get a house

1422
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,560
and get a mortgage at 18%.

1423
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,320
That was a 30-year fixed
rate back in the 1980s.

1424
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,450
So borrowing rates
are very, very low

1425
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,360
by these historical standards.

1426
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,390
If borrowing rates
are very low, what

1427
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:08,830
does that tell you about credit
and about the amount of cash

1428
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:12,940
sloshing around in the economy?

1429
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,625
Yeah?

1430
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:14,960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1431
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
ANDREW LO: Exactly--
lots and lots

1432
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,950
and lots of money available.

1433
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,560
So for those of you
who are thinking

1434
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,582
about entrepreneurial
ventures-- if you're

1435
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:24,040
thinking about
raising capital, you

1436
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,040
might be depressed by what's
going on in markets today.

1437
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,560
But look at the interest
rate and ask yourself,

1438
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,010
gee, would I rather start a
company today or back in 1982?

1439
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,970
There's a heck of a
lot more money sloshing

1440
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,800
around the system today.

1441
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,670
In fact, a few years
ago, I talked to a couple

1442
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,507
of MIT undergraduates.

1443
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,340
One of them came up and
asked me whether I'd

1444
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,180
be willing to advise them on
some internet company they

1445
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,680
wanted to start.

1446
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,414
And you know, I said, well,
you know, where are you

1447
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:54,580
going to get your financing?

1448
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,770
And they said, oh,
don't worry about that.

1449
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:57,460
We've already got it all set.

1450
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,310
You know, we've got 10
of us, and each of us

1451
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:04,660
is able to borrow $1,000
each on credit cards,

1452
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:10,810
and we each have 10 credit
cards, so that's $100,000.

1453
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:12,990
And I'm saying, $100,000
on credit cards?

1454
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,620
I mean, you guys are going
to be paying 18% a year

1455
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,750
or something on that.

1456
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,208
And they said,
yeah, you know what?

1457
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,860
That's the cheapest venture
financing you'll ever find.

1458
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,100
And they're right, because
those are non-recourse loans.

1459
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,810
They don't take a
piece of your company.

1460
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,096
And 18% for a venture is
actually pretty attractive.

1461
01:06:29,096 --> 01:06:30,970
Well, look at what the
borrowing rate is now.

1462
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,257
Now, you can't borrow at
this rate for ventures,

1463
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:35,590
but it indicates that there's
a lot of credit out there,

1464
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,900
and there's still a lot
of credit out there.

1465
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,810
In fact, the
treasury and the Fed

1466
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,880
would argue there's too
much credit out there.

1467
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,171
And that's why we're in the
problems that we are today.

1468
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:46,300
Because too many people--

1469
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,320
people that should not have
been leveraging and borrowing

1470
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,680
have done so.

1471
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,490
And now, we're feeling the
pains of a contraction.

1472
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,890
So this is the history
of yield curves.

1473
01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:01,090
And at a given point in time, we
can take a look at yield curves

1474
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,580
and see how that curve
changes day to day.

1475
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,770
I showed you today's yield
curve, which is upward sloping.

1476
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:10,180
But you know, there was
a period back in 2000

1477
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,390
where this yield curve was
actually upward-sloping,

1478
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:17,250
and then downward-sloping.

1479
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,840
Why would the yield curve
be downward-sloping?

1480
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,490
What that tells
you is that there's

1481
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:26,480
an expectation of the
market participants

1482
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,010
that interest rates in the
long run have got to come down,

1483
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,740
and that there's going to
be some kind of Fed policy

1484
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,430
shift possible within three
years, five years, 10 years,

1485
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,650
that would make that
more likely than not.

1486
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:44,240
So by looking at these yield
curves over different dates,

1487
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,450
you can get a sense of how
the market's expectations are

1488
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:52,260
of the future, which I think
is a tremendous ability

1489
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,260
to actually look into the
future-- at least look

1490
01:07:54,260 --> 01:08:00,954
into the future as predicted
by all the market participants.

1491
01:08:00,954 --> 01:08:03,120
This is just that yield
curve that I told you about.

1492
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,800
This is not in your
notes, but I was

1493
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,716
able to copy that from
Bloomberg this morning.

1494
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,940
You have that in
the public website.

1495
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:15,090
And now, the next topic I want
to take on-- very briefly,

1496
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:19,170
because there's a lot to be
said about models of the yield

1497
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,960
curve, and I won't take
up class time to do that.

1498
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:26,069
This is something
that is a topic that's

1499
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:29,729
more significantly
focused on in investments

1500
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:32,160
and in fixed-income securities.

1501
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,460
But one of the things that
we'd like to be able to do

1502
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,300
is to try to model that term
structure interest rates.

1503
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,189
Is there any logic
that we can come up

1504
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,800
with that explains
why the yield curve is

1505
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,939
upward-sloping or
backward-bending or inverted?

1506
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:51,060
And it turns out that there
are a number of theories

1507
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,340
that have come to be proposed.

1508
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,590
I'm not going to cover
any of these in any depth,

1509
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,881
but I want to at least mention
the names so that you'll

1510
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,569
know that there are theories
out there that will tell you

1511
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:04,170
whether or not the yield curve
should be so steeply sloped

1512
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,310
or not.

1513
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,735
There's something called
the Expectations Hypothesis.

1514
01:09:07,735 --> 01:09:09,359
There is something
called the Liquidity

1515
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,620
Preference Hypothesis.

1516
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,859
There is a Preferred Habitat
Model, Market Segmentation

1517
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:14,620
Model.

1518
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,609
And then, there are a whole
slew of extraordinarily

1519
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:21,359
sophisticated and complex
mathematical models,

1520
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,229
one of which--

1521
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,812
and probably the
best known of which--

1522
01:09:23,812 --> 01:09:27,660
was developed by our very
own John Cox and Steve Ross.

1523
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:30,630
The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross
model of the term structure

1524
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:34,170
of interest rates is probably
the single best known yield

1525
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,260
curve model.

1526
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,930
It's a very complicated
model, but it

1527
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,246
has some pretty
significant implications

1528
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:40,620
for whether the
yield curve ought

1529
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,540
to be upward-sloping
or downward-sloping,

1530
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,390
or how it changes over time.

1531
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,200
I'll give you one example
of what these theories are,

1532
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,090
and I won't spend
much time on it,

1533
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,880
but I want to at least leave
you with some intuition

1534
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,190
for how you would go
about modeling it.

1535
01:09:56,190 --> 01:10:04,630
So one model says that today's
forward rates are in fact

1536
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:10,470
the best guess of what future
spot rates are likely to be,

1537
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:14,100
and that's known as the
Expectations Hypothesis.

1538
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,340
This hypothesis states that
today's forward rate, which

1539
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:24,560
is what we do observe, is equal
to the mathematical expectation

1540
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,210
today, of the future
one-year spot rate.

1541
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:31,710
Now, you might say,
well, that's not

1542
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:32,876
that's not much of a theory.

1543
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:34,420
I mean, what else could it be?

1544
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,200
Well, it turns out that there
is another theory called

1545
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,320
the Preferred Liquidity
Preference Theory that

1546
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:46,420
says that the longer
the term of borrowing,

1547
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:50,200
the more you're going to have
to pay a premium for people

1548
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:56,660
to lend to you, because
people would prefer liquidity.

1549
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:00,710
So the longer you
demand the borrowing

1550
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:04,880
for a greater period of time,
the more you have to pay--

1551
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,130
much more so than just linearly.

1552
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,210
So in particular, the
Expectations Hypothesis

1553
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:14,020
suggests that the
yield curve is flat.

1554
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,930
Right?

1555
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:18,810
There's no impact on borrowing
for two years, three years,

1556
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,360
five years, 10 years.

1557
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,120
The future rate
is just equal to--

1558
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,110
today's forward rate is the
expectation of the future.

1559
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,610
OK?

1560
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,410
It's a fair bet.

1561
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,480
Liquidity Preference
says that the yield curve

1562
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,030
should be upward-sloping,
because it's

1563
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:39,690
going to be more costly
for you to borrow

1564
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:42,900
over a three-year period than
a one-year period, simply

1565
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,920
because it's going
to entail somebody

1566
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,637
giving up their money for
a longer period of time.

1567
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:50,970
They're going to be less liquid.

1568
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,150
You're going to have to bribe
them to be willing to give up

1569
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,810
that liquidity.

1570
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,960
That's the Liquidity
Preference Theory.

1571
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,610
The Preferred
Habitat Theory says,

1572
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:06,470
you know, there are preferred
maturities that people have.

1573
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:08,120
And for those
maturities, you're going

1574
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,930
to have different rates than for
those that people don't prefer.

1575
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,060
So if you want a
30-year maturity--

1576
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,504
and that's not preferred
because it's too far off--

1577
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,170
then you're gonna
have to pay a premium.

1578
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,870
On the Other Hand,
10 years is a period

1579
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,840
that a number of
pension funds prefer,

1580
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,480
so you may not have to pay
as much for those preferred

1581
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,200
habitats.

1582
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,320
And to give you a sense of
where academics is today,

1583
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,420
none of these models work.

1584
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,600
None of them can fully
explain movements

1585
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,640
in the yield curve,
which, by the way,

1586
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,670
is a wonderful opportunity
for all of you.

1587
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:48,090
Because if you have a
model that does work,

1588
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,490
then you can do
extraordinarily well.

1589
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,030
You can turn very, very
small forecast power

1590
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:56,680
into enormous amounts
of wealth very,

1591
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,710
very quickly on Wall Street.

1592
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,384
Yes?

1593
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:09,667
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1594
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:10,500
ANDREW LO: Does he--

1595
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,099
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1596
01:13:12,099 --> 01:13:13,390
ANDREW LO: You can't patent it.

1597
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:13,889
Right.

1598
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,290
So does he get anything out
of that besides notoriety?

1599
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,130
Well, that's a good question.

1600
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,030
The question has to do with,
I guess, the difference

1601
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:26,020
between academic endeavors
and business endeavors.

1602
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,880
As an academic, what
you're trying to do

1603
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,430
is to make a name for
yourself and to put out

1604
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,460
research ideas that
will have an impact

1605
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:36,980
with your colleagues and the
particular area that you're in.

1606
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,490
So if you're asking,
did Professor Cox

1607
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:40,540
get rich off of this?

1608
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,180
The answer is, no, probably not.

1609
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,680
Neither did
Black-Scholes, actually,

1610
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,930
when they published their
Black-Scholes option pricing

1611
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,440
formula.

1612
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,648
That was the same year that
the Chicago Board Options

1613
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:51,820
Exchange started trading,
and everybody just

1614
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,750
used the option pricing formula
almost from the very start.

1615
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,170
Did they make money off of that?

1616
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,622
No, they didn't.

1617
01:13:57,622 --> 01:13:58,330
And you're right.

1618
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,620
You can't patent it.

1619
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:03,880
So very often, in
financial firms,

1620
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,140
when they have good ideas--

1621
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,700
so for example, I
do believe there

1622
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,610
are term structure models out
there that work reasonably

1623
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:10,410
well.

1624
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:11,620
They're not published.

1625
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:15,640
They're kept as the Coca-Colas
of financial markets.

1626
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,990
They're trade secrets.

1627
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,540
And so if you go there
to work and ultimately

1628
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,840
work with the right people, you
will learn such trade secrets,

1629
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,600
which, by the way, is one of
the reasons why when Barclays

1630
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,060
acquires Lehman and wants
to keep all of these

1631
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,040
really, really terrific
people together,

1632
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,270
they're going to have to
offer premia to do that.

1633
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:35,230
And so that's part of the
cost of financial distress

1634
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,210
when you disturb the status quo.

1635
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:44,860
That's a few models of the term
structure of interest rates.

1636
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:49,140
And I want to talk about one
last topic on coupon bonds

1637
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,980
before concluding this lecture.

1638
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,350
Next lecture on Monday,
we're going to take up

1639
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,390
measures of interest rate risk.

1640
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,850
We're going to look explicitly
at what happens when

1641
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,320
interest rates bounce around.

1642
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,080
Before we get to that, though,
I want to talk about another way

1643
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,720
to value coupon bonds,
and it's exactly the idea

1644
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:11,070
that I said before, of using
pure discount bonds to do so.

1645
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:14,790
If I have a pure
discount bond, I

1646
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:18,450
can use that to price
coupon bonds by building up

1647
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,490
a package of discount bonds.

1648
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,920
The example of the
strips is given here.

1649
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,740
You've got a three-year
5% bond, and it turns out

1650
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,560
that you can show that that
three-year 5% bond is going

1651
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,060
to be identical to 50 one-year
strips, 50 two-year strips,

1652
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,050
and 1050 three-year
strips, each strip

1653
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:42,600
paying $1 in years 1, 2, and 3.

1654
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,950
Any question about that claim?

1655
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:46,950
Anybody want to argue with
me that that's not true?

1656
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,840
It's pretty obvious, right?

1657
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,100
Well, this actually has a
very dramatic implication,

1658
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,530
and let me tell you what
that implication is.

1659
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:03,040
The implication is that the
price of a three-year 5% bond

1660
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,660
better be equal to the cost
of 50 one-year strips, 50

1661
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:12,100
two-year strips, and
1050 three-year strips.

1662
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,740
The price of this
three-year bond

1663
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:18,220
better be equal to what it costs
to put that portfolio of strips

1664
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,260
together today.

1665
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,000
Why?

1666
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,200
Why should it be equal?

1667
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:24,923
Yes.

1668
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:25,770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1669
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,540
ANDREW LO: What is arbitrage?

1670
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,801
We haven't defined that.

1671
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:32,030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] basically,
if the prices are different,

1672
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,150
[INAUDIBLE] buy the
one or sell the other,

1673
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,979
so they come
together [INAUDIBLE]..

1674
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:36,770
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

1675
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:41,510
There is a way to make
money if the price

1676
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:45,380
of that three-year bond is
anything other than the cost

1677
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,540
of that package of strips.

1678
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,050
So let's do an example.

1679
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,560
Suppose that the price
of a three-year bond

1680
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,800
is greater than the
cost of the strips.

1681
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,900
Tell me what to do.

1682
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,510
Yeah?

1683
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,970
STUDENT: Buy those strips,
package them into a bond,

1684
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:01,484
and then sell it.

1685
01:17:01,484 --> 01:17:02,902
Sell the bond to the market.

1686
01:17:02,902 --> 01:17:04,610
Just keep doing that
over and over again.

1687
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,200
ANDREW LO: OK.

1688
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,450
So let's talk about this slowly.

1689
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,200
I first buy those strips.

1690
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,360
I buy the portfolio strips.

1691
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,810
And then, I take
this bond that's

1692
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:18,130
trading in the open
marketplace, and I sell it.

1693
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,860
How do I sell
something I don't own?

1694
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,732
Short-sell it, yes.

1695
01:17:22,732 --> 01:17:25,190
Short-selling, which you can
read about and Brealey, Myers,

1696
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,390
and Allen, is when, if you
don't own the security,

1697
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,910
you can borrow it from a
broker, and then sell it,

1698
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:35,091
and you'll collect the
money from selling it.

1699
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:36,590
Now, the broker,
obviously, is going

1700
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,830
to want you to keep that
money in that brokerage firm

1701
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,720
so that you don't
run away with it.

1702
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,477
Because you've borrowed
the security at some point,

1703
01:17:44,477 --> 01:17:45,560
you've got to pay it back.

1704
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,018
You've got to return
that security.

1705
01:17:47,018 --> 01:17:47,870
Right?

1706
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,770
So the transaction is,
you buy these strips,

1707
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:55,970
you short-sell the bond,
and what have you done?

1708
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,370
Have you made money or
lost money on day one?

1709
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,120
You've made money.

1710
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:00,619
Why?

1711
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:03,225
Because buying costs less
than the amount of money

1712
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,100
you get from selling.

1713
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,850
And how do you know that?

1714
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:09,050
Because I just assumed that
it's more expensive for you

1715
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,320
to get the three-year bond
than the package of strips.

1716
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,410
So you've made
money today, but you

1717
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:19,670
have no further obligations,
because what you end up

1718
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,850
getting from the strips--
you've bought the strips,

1719
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,860
so you're going to get their
coupons or their face value.

1720
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,850
You're going to use those to
pay the coupons of the bonds

1721
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,450
that you sold.

1722
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,580
And therefore, you have
no further obligations,

1723
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:36,190
but you have a pile of
money in front of you.

1724
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,570
That's pretty cool.

1725
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,560
And if you do that a lot,
that pile of money grows.

1726
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,089
So obviously, we know
it's not easy to do that.

1727
01:18:45,089 --> 01:18:46,630
And if it's not easy
to do that, that

1728
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:50,200
means that our assumption
that the bond was greater

1729
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,990
than the cost of the
strips can't be true.

1730
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,180
If you reverse the logic,
you get the same kind

1731
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,830
of argument in reverse.

1732
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,570
Therefore, the only
thing that could be

1733
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,850
is that the prices are
equal to each other.

1734
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,650
Next time, what
we're going to do

1735
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:05,119
is show that a little
bit of linear algebra

1736
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,910
is going to allow you
to make tons of money

1737
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,770
by comparing all sorts
of bonds and looking

1738
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:10,280
at these kinds of relationships.

1739
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:10,780
OK.

1740
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:14,460
I'll see you at 4:00,
if you're interested.
