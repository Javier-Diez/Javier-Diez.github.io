ANDREW W. LO: So on
behalf of the Sloan School

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,840
I want to welcome all of you
to 15.401 Finance Theory.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,340
This course is meant for
first year MBA students.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,280
And so that's the
focus, and I'm going

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,050
to assume that that's the
background that all of you

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,990
will have.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,640
We may have a few other
students in the class,

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,020
but primarily it will
be first year MBAs who

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,280
are thinking about
a career in finance,

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,780
as well as those
of you who aren't

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,140
sure about a career in finance
but are curious about it.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,170
Hopefully over the
next 13 weeks we'll

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,850
be able to satisfy
that curiosity.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,090
I want to start by
talking a little bit

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,940
about what finance is, and
how I got interested in it,

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,520
because I think it's
often helpful in order

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,250
to motivate a subject
to get a sense of how

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,830
somebody else decided to
choose this as a profession.

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,080
To do that I have to
go back a little bit,

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,910
and give you some
background about

28
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,110
my own educational experiences.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,270
So let me start by
mentioning that I've

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,330
been at MIT for
the past 20 years,

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,540
and been in the finance
group all that time.

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,730
Before that I taught at the
Wharton School for four years.

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,940
And before that, I got
my PhD in economics

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,230
from Harvard University,
and then graduated in 1980

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,100
from Yale also
majoring in economics.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,360
And during that time I've
learned an enormous amount

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,389
both about finance
and the real world,

38
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,970
but one of the things
that I keep coming back to

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,390
is the fact that
the finance field

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,460
is almost unique in how it
applies to practical management

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,880
problems.

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,260
And what I want to try to
do over the next 13 weeks

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,010
is to convince you of
the fact that finance

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,140
is in fact, the most
important subject

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,420
that you'll ever encounter.

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,470
That in fact, finance is
at the core of everything

47
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,370
that you will ever do in
business and in management.

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,250
Now that's a tall
order I recognize,

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,780
and I suspect that
some of you are

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,050
quite skeptical about the
role that finance might play

51
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,590
in your own career objectives.

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,914
And I know many of you have very
different career objectives.

53
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,830
And I'm not even trying
to convince all of you

54
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,260
to go into a career
in finance, but I

55
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,800
am trying to convince all of
you that finance is really

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,250
the lifeblood and
the basic lingua

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,890
franca of all of business.

58
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,870
And that's one of the
reasons why finance

59
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,940
is such an important subject.

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,800
Now before I begin, let
me ask you a question.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,350
How many people have had no
finance background whatsoever?

62
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,150
Oh, that's great.

63
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,554
I look forward to a challenge.

64
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:26,970
But the other
reason it's great is

65
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,390
I have to tell you that it's
a real privilege for me to be

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,080
here in front of you to
tell you about finance

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,190
for the very first time.

68
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,190
And it reminds me a
little bit of my younger

69
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,259
son who is an
extraordinarily fussy eater,

70
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,300
he's eight years old now.

71
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,210
But ever since he was born
he had some allergies,

72
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,410
and he just refused to
eat most of everything.

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,210
In fact, my wife often says that
my younger son is a vegetarian

74
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,550
except he doesn't
eat vegetables.

75
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,110
So he's an incredibly
fussy eater,

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,540
and somehow when
he was one year old

77
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,870
he saw my older son
eating an ice cream cone,

78
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,307
and figured that that's
something he ought to try.

79
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:04,890
How he figured that
out, I don't know.

80
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,520
But he tasted it for
the very first time,

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,840
and you could see his face
change in about four seconds

82
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,490
from disgust to curiosity
to absolute, you know,

83
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,760
enthrallment with the taste
and feel of ice cream.

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,334
He just loved it thereafter.

85
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,000
That's one of his
major food groups now.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
It's ice cream.

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,040
And so I feel privileged to be
able to share that experience

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,999
here in the sense that once
you get a taste of finance,

89
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,540
I think you're going
to be incredibly

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,460
excited and enthralled
by the subject.

91
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,140
Because it's one of
the few subjects,

92
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,900
in fact, that's the only
subject that I've encountered

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,860
that is both rigorous,
it's extraordinarily

94
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,850
challenging from a research
and intellectual perspective,

95
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,460
and at the end of the day
it's extremely practical.

96
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,670
In fact, I would say
it's indispensable

97
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,131
for financial management.

98
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,630
So I'm going to try to convince
you of that over the next 13

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,770
weeks, and I'm going to do
that by going over material

100
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,515
that you will find
indispensable.

101
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,390
As many of you know, at
the end of the course

102
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,300
we have a ritual where we
hand out teaching ratings.

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
And among the finance faculty,
among all the faculty,

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,210
we're very concerned
about good teaching.

105
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,670
So these teaching
ratings actually matter.

106
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,390
And I've always thought that
having a teaching rating

107
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,550
survey at the end
of the semester,

108
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,320
is somewhat misguided.

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,020
What I'd like to do,
and what I've proposed

110
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,360
hasn't been adopted
yet, I propose

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,610
to have teaching
ratings submitted five

112
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,100
years after a course is done.

113
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,270
Now this may be a problem
for some people who aren't

114
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,920
up to speed in the classroom.

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
But the reason I say this
is, because it will only

116
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,790
be after you get into your
jobs, into your careers,

117
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,240
before you realize
how useful finance is.

118
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,510
And five years from now,
I suspect all of you

119
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,950
will come back
and say, gee, this

120
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,325
is one of the most important
courses you have ever taken.

121
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,290
Not because of me, but because
of the substance of what

122
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,240
we're going to cover
over the next 13 weeks.

123
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,460
It's because of you
and all of the work

124
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,050
that you will put
into this course.

125
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,470
This will be the most
challenging course

126
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,910
you will ever love.

127
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,400
So I-- stealing
from the military--

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,740
I think that you'll
really appreciate

129
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,070
how the discipline
of financial logic

130
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,980
will help you to think smarter
about all of your management

131
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,312
decisions no matter what you
decide to do with your careers.

132
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:27,520
Now that's a very tall order.

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
I've built up expectations.

134
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,570
So I'm going to have to
deliver over the next 13 weeks,

135
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,070
and we'll see whether
or not we can do that.

136
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,150
But let me start now
by talking about what

137
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,120
we're going to cover today.

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,940
I want to start with a
little bit of motivation,

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,430
and then talk about
the dramatis personae.

140
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,890
These are the cast of
characters that we're

141
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,670
going to be focusing on
over the next 13 weeks.

142
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,400
And then I'm going to lay out
the fundamental challenges

143
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,640
of financial analysis.

144
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,210
It turns out there are only two.

145
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,000
There are only two challenges
in financial analysis,

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,430
and once you figure both
of those out, you're done.

147
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,440
So if by chance you
can figure that out

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,023
before the end of
the class, you don't

149
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:10,160
need to come back for
the rest of the lectures.

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,010
Then I'm going to
turn to providing you

151
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,650
with a framework for thinking
about these financial

152
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,970
challenges.

153
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,910
To me it's very important to
have a framework to start with,

154
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,770
because I like to
organize my thoughts

155
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,999
into things that I know and
things that I don't know.

156
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,540
And of the things that I know,
how did it relate to the stuff

157
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,790
that I already knew,
or thought I knew.

158
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,700
So I want to give you a sense
of that kind of framework

159
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,340
to think about financial
analysis upfront.

160
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,230
You probably won't fully
appreciate it at this point,

161
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,126
but sometime over the next
13 weeks you will get it.

162
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,500
And so I want to
give that to you

163
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,410
so that you can start thinking
about it subconsciously,

164
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,810
unconsciously, and
then eventually you

165
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,640
will understand how all
the pieces fit together.

166
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,640
I then want to talk
about the importance

167
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,250
of two aspects of
financial analysis

168
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,400
that make finance different
from every other discipline you

169
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,940
will ever encounter here
at MIT and elsewhere.

170
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,700
And that is time and risk.

171
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,500
Without those two
factors it turns out

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,990
that finance is actually done.

173
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,830
In other words, there's no
real research challenges,

174
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,810
no open questions left once
you eliminate time and risk.

175
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,300
Put in another way,
the only reason

176
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,180
that there exists a finance
department, and finance

177
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,630
faculty, and finance journals,
and a finance industry,

178
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,710
the only reason is
because of time and risk.

179
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,450
So I'm going to
come back to that.

180
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,710
Then I'm going to conclude
by giving you the six

181
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,480
basic principles of finance.

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,760
These are principles
that you will encounter

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,730
in all of your finance courses
for the rest of your stay

184
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,480
at MIT and elsewhere.

185
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,510
These are the ideas,
the fundamental ideas,

186
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,010
that have shaped
financial markets

187
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,430
and that are at the root cause
of all of the financial market

188
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,370
innovations, as well as all
of the financial market crises

189
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,740
that we've seen including
what's been going on

190
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,290
over the last several months in
the subprime mortgage market.

191
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,623
In fact, we're going to talk
about the subprime mortgage

192
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:09,360
problems after we cover
fixed income securities.

193
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,550
Right now I suspect
most of you know

194
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,280
that there's something going
on, know that it's bad stuff,

195
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,260
but you don't know
why, how, where, when,

196
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,160
and what to do about it.

197
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,960
Well, in about five
lectures, you will.

198
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,110
It's not complicated, but
it's different from anything

199
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,580
that you've ever encountered.

200
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,920
And in fact, financial
analysis, I suspect,

201
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,130
is different from anything most
of you have ever encountered.

202
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,260
I'm hoping that by
the end of the course,

203
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,370
it will change the way you
think about everything.

204
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,160
And again, I recognize
that that's a tall order,

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,570
but you tell me
13 weeks from now

206
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,240
whether or not I've delivered.

207
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,400
And then I'll conclude by
talking about the course

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,110
overview, and then
finally I want

209
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,174
to say a few words
about how as a student

210
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,840
you can get the most
out of this course.

211
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,130
This is a part of the
lecture that I've always

212
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,580
felt is critical at the
very start of a course

213
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,910
like this, because there
are a number of challenges

214
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,950
that you will face
over the next 13

215
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,239
weeks regarding this material.

216
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,780
And I've always
thought that it would

217
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,676
be helpful for the instructor
to let me know where

218
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:14,050
those challenges
might come from,

219
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,650
and what I should do
in advance to prepare

220
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,580
for those challenges.

221
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,950
So I'm going to do that at the
end of this hour and a half.

222
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,740
For next time I'd like you
to read Brealey and Myers,

223
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,660
chapters one and two.

224
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,320
We are going to be covering that
today as well as next Monday.

225
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,710
So please keep up
with your readings.

226
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,440
And at the end of
this lecture, I

227
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,780
will talk a bit about
the course requirements

228
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,770
and other aspects of
the course mechanics.

229
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,990
Any questions?

230
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,300
All right, let me start
with some motivation

231
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,000
about why you might
want to study finance

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,610
and why finance is so important.

233
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,570
And I've always found that with
motivation it's really best

234
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,210
to do it in a personal way.

235
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,640
That is, to try to find
an individual or a group

236
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,810
of individuals that personify
a particular discipline

237
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,657
or endeavor.

238
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,240
And so there are
three people that I'd

239
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
like to introduce you to.

240
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,610
I suspect you'll know at
least two out of the three,

241
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,020
but my guess is you
won't know all of them.

242
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,550
The first person--
oh, before I do

243
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,250
that, I want to introduce a
very simple definition of what

244
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,510
finance is.

245
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,950
So this is the
very first equation

246
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,450
that you'll ever
see in this course,

247
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,370
and there'll be many
others of course.

248
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,870
But the first expression
of exactly what is finance

249
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,750
is this, finance is simply
equal to mathematics plus money.

250
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,480
Now that suggests that
mathematics as a discipline

251
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,190
is equal to finance
without the money,

252
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,090
but really that's not my point.

253
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,630
Although it's true by the
way, that's not my point.

254
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,150
My point is that
finance is the study,

255
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,770
the systematic and disciplined
study of financial transactions

256
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,610
of money.

257
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,356
Now when you see this you
might think, well, gee,

258
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,230
I don't really have a
strong math background.

259
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,750
Maybe I'm in the wrong
place or the wrong class.

260
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,670
And I want to explain to
you that that's completely

261
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,090
inaccurate, and inappropriate.

262
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,610
When I say mathematics,
I'm actually

263
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,390
talking about a very wide
range of mathematics.

264
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,240
Everything from
the extraordinarily

265
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,310
complex and profound to
the extremely pedestrian

266
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,720
and obvious.

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,340
So literally the range
from differential geometry

268
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,870
and partial
differential equations

269
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,430
on one end of the spectrum
to arithmetic and high school

270
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,410
algebra at the other
end of the spectrum.

271
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,340
Now since this is an
introductory finance class,

272
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,570
I assume that you know nothing.

273
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,120
What I mean by that
is, I assume that there

274
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,330
are no prerequisites that you
have other than what it took

275
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,370
for you to get
into here, which is

276
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,090
pretty substantial by the way.

277
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,770
Congratulations to all
of you for getting in.

278
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,590
But we're not
requiring that you have

279
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,540
any background in quantitative
analysis, computers,

280
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,220
upper level mathematics.

281
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,250
So when I say finance is equal
to mathematics plus money,

282
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,320
there's a variety of
kinds of mathematics

283
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,910
that can be appropriate
for creating

284
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,540
an extraordinarily profitable
career in this industry.

285
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,100
And now here are
the three examples.

286
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,478
Anybody know who
James Simons is?

287
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,434
Who is he?

288
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,390
AUDIENCE: Well, I know
about Renaissance.

289
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,640
ANDREW W. LO: You know about
Renaissance Technologies.

290
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,010
Do you know what James
Simons did before he started

291
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,369
Renaissance Technologies?

292
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:41,868
Yeah.

293
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,270
AUDIENCE: He's a math professor.

294
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,360
ANDREW W. LO: He's a math
professor, that's right.

295
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,620
James Simons is
a math professor.

296
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,100
Well, was a math professor.

297
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,520
In fact, he was quite a
well-known math professor.

298
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,890
When I first heard
of him, it wasn't

299
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,510
because of Renaissance
Technologies,

300
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,850
which is a hedge
fund that he started

301
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,720
about 15 or 20 years ago.

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,370
James Simons was a differential
geometer who for many years

303
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,740
was the chairman of
the math department

304
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,240
at Stony Brook in New York.

305
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,000
And he authored with S.S. Chern
a particular field of study

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,020
in differential geometry called
Chern-Simons theory, which

307
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,240
has subsequently proved
to be extraordinarily

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,050
useful in an area of physics
known as string theory.

309
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,450
Extraordinarily abstract.

310
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,520
And Simon started a hedge
fund about 20 years ago.

311
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,460
And this is probably the single
most successful hedge fund

312
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,300
in the history of the industry
in terms of its performance

313
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,770
record.

314
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,610
Over the course
of 15 or 20 years,

315
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,340
he's put together a track
record that has literally

316
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,310
beaten every other hedge
fund manager's track

317
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,660
record by a lot.

318
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,120
So it's not just a little bit.

319
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
He's just sort of way out there.

320
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,530
He's the Michael Phelps
of quantitative investment

321
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,060
strategies.

322
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,910
By the way, just to give you
a sense of how successful

323
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,210
he has been.

324
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,750
In 2006, two years
ago, it was reported

325
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,330
by Institutional
Investor's Alpha Magazine--

326
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,830
this is a trade publication for
the hedge fund industry-- it

327
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,680
was reported that James Simons
was the single most highly

328
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,200
paid hedge fund
manager that year

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,055
with a take-home
pay of $1.7 billion.

330
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:38,700
Now, that's not
wealth, that's income.

331
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,595
That was on his W-2.

332
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,300
That was one year's
compensation.

333
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,120
And he did it--

334
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,570
he did this by building
a quantitative investment

335
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,680
management company with 75
PhDs in mathematics, physics,

336
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,110
computer science, and so on.

337
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,620
And nobody, nobody knows what
he does or how he does it.

338
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,590
It's extraordinarily secret.

339
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,500
But there's no doubt that
he's incredibly successful.

340
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,740
So that's one end
of the spectrum.

341
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,680
That kind of mathematics
can make money,

342
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,630
and can be extraordinarily
relevant financial analysis.

343
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,200
Now at the other end of the
spectrum, we have this guy.

344
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,240
You may have heard of
him, Warren Buffett.

345
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,630
He is currently the
richest man on earth.

346
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,040
In 2008 Forbes ranked him
number one in terms of wealth.

347
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,794
At the time, February of 2008,
he was worth $62 billion.

348
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:40,210
In fact, in a
private conversation

349
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,990
I was told that when Simons
found out he said, really?

350
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,920
$62 billion?

351
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,990
How did he get that?

352
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,350
It's amazing.

353
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,320
That's an extraordinary amount
of wealth for an individual

354
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,190
to put together.

355
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,610
And what's extraordinary
about it, is how he did it.

356
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,850
As many of you know Warren
Buffett is an investor based

357
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,130
in Omaha, Nebraska.

358
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,099
His office is probably smaller
than many of the conference

359
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,869
rooms here at Sloan.

360
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,660
The number of people he has
working for him, I suspect,

361
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,160
is fewer than many
of you who have

362
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
done your startups or plan to.

363
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,310
He's got an extraordinarily
small staff.

364
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,200
Mainly it's Charlie
Munger and him,

365
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,170
and a couple of
secretaries, and maybe

366
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,140
a few accountants here and
there, and lawyers of course.

367
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,800
But what he does is to read
company prospectuses, income

368
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,930
statements, balance sheets.

369
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,920
And with literally
high school arithmetic

370
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,890
he's built this incredible
investment empire

371
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,200
by looking at valuation.

372
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,560
Simple accounting.

373
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,220
Now I say simple accounting,
but there's nothing simple

374
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,420
about what he does.

375
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,860
And so clearly he
has certain skills

376
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,380
that also involve
mathematics, but not

377
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,230
the kind of mathematics
that James Simons uses.

378
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,330
And finally, the
third individual

379
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,830
that I'd like to introduce you
to is this fellow, Jack Welch.

380
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,650
Now again, many of you
know him or know of him.

381
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,900
You know that he actually
teaches a course here at Sloan.

382
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,250
But you may not know
that his PhD was actually

383
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,400
in engineering.

384
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,090
And he started out at
General Electric in 1960.

385
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:32,840
Became CEO in 1981, and
at that time the revenues

386
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,480
of General Electric was
about $26 billion a year.

387
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,790
So it was already a big
and successful company.

388
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,000
And Jack Welch took
it over in 1981.

389
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,470
At the time there were 400,000
employees for General Electric.

390
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,950
Five years later, there
were 300,000 employees

391
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,180
at General Electric.

392
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,666
He eliminated 100,000 jobs.

393
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,290
That's one of the reasons why he
developed the nickname Neutron

394
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,260
Jack, because like
a neutron bomb,

395
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,290
he eliminated a huge
segment of the population.

396
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,020
But five years later
with 300,000 employees,

397
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,720
he increased the market
value of General Electric

398
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,370
by several fold.

399
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,410
And at the end of his tenure
in 2001, 20 years later,

400
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,330
General Electric's revenues
was not $26 billion,

401
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,530
it was $130 billion.

402
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,770
He increased it by a
factor of 4 and 1/2

403
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,720
over the course of 20 years.

404
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,940
It's an extraordinary
accomplishment

405
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,960
for an individual.

406
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,170
Now why do I put him up here?

407
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,270
It's because one of
the things that Welch

408
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,020
did at General Electric,
one of the things

409
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,080
that he was extraordinarily
good at, was making

410
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,830
good decisions about
investments, making

411
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,180
good decisions about costs,
being able to understand

412
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,960
the language of finance
despite the fact

413
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,810
that he used none of his
PhD skills in his job.

414
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,110
He was an engineer by
training, not a manager.

415
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,680
He didn't go to
management school,

416
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,410
although he did a lot
of executive education

417
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,120
after his PhD.

418
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,640
The reason that I give you
these three cast of characters

419
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,110
is because they are so
different in what they do.

420
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,450
They have such
different backgrounds.

421
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,270
They're all
extraordinarily successful,

422
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,690
but there's one thing in common.

423
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,410
The thing in common is that
they all understand innately,

424
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,250
deeply, fundamentally,
the language of finance.

425
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,980
And what we're going to
cover over the next 13 weeks,

426
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,150
are the very basics.

427
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,680
Things that they
take for granted.

428
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,030
Things that they use on a
daily basis to do their jobs.

429
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,540
So it's not to say that if
you do well in this course

430
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,240
you'll end up being
one of these guys,

431
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,720
but it's certainly a
prerequisite I would say.

432
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,450
There's nobody that's been
successful in business,

433
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,290
truly successful, without having
an understanding, at least

434
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,780
an innate or instinctive
understanding,

435
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,780
of the concepts that we're
going to cover over the next 13

436
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,950
weeks.

437
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,150
So to me, that's exciting.

438
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,200
Now again, I'm not trying
to motivate you by greed.

439
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,450
I'd rather motivate you by
the intellectual challenge

440
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,090
of finance, and there will
be some extraordinarily

441
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,800
challenging ideas.

442
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,510
Ideas that are not natural
for any of you at this point,

443
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,780
but which I hope
will be very natural

444
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,960
at the end of this 13 weeks.

445
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,960
So let me start with
the cast of characters

446
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,270
that we're going to be studying
over the next 13 weeks.

447
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,950
There are going to be four
components of the economy

448
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,200
that we're going to focus on.

449
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,950
Now this is a flow
diagram of the economy.

450
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,560
Since we're at MIT we
have to have flow diagrams

451
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,030
at some point, right?

452
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,900
So here's my version
of a flow diagram.

453
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,850
This is a flow model
of the economy,

454
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,220
and there are four
components that

455
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,990
comprise the financial system.

456
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,560
Households, financial
intermediaries,

457
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,060
non-financial corporations,
and then capital markets.

458
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,150
Now obviously the
economy is comprised

459
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,270
of additional components like
labor markets and product

460
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,595
markets.

461
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:11,970
We're not going
to focus on that.

462
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,178
Although there are certain
financial aspects of those

463
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:15,370
markets.

464
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,790
Given that we only
have 13 weeks,

465
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,180
our attention will be spent
on those four components,

466
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,090
and I'm going to cover each
of those four components,

467
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,671
both in parallel and to a
certain degree sequentially,

468
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,170
all right?

469
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,246
So I want you to be
familiar with these four,

470
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,620
because we're
going to be talking

471
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,490
about them interchangeably
at various points in time.

472
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,000
Financial analysis applies
to all of these components

473
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,780
in exactly the same way.

474
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,320
But once you apply them
to the specific context,

475
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,350
the terminology may change,
the particular applications

476
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,430
may look different.

477
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,920
What I'm going to try to
teach you in this 13 weeks

478
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,170
is the underpinning
theories that

479
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,710
unify all of the various
different kinds of ideas.

480
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,690
So these are the four
components that we're

481
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,510
going to be looking
at from now and then.

482
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,510
Now let me talk about the
fundamental challenges

483
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,009
of finance.

484
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,970
I told you that there
are only two, right?

485
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,590
And here they are.

486
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,374
There are two aspects
of financial analysis

487
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:12,790
that we're going
to be focused on.

488
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,500
The first is the
valuation of assets.

489
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,170
And the second is very simply
the management of assets.

490
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,040
That's it.

491
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,090
That's all there is to it.

492
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,017
Valuing and managing.

493
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,850
And I can tell you
exactly what the managing

494
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,100
part is going to look like.

495
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,910
Managing is going to involve
figuring out which of two

496
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,172
possibilities is more valuable.

497
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,130
And then you know what?

498
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,350
You take the more
valuable option.

499
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,430
That's it.

500
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,820
That's all there is to it.

501
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,670
Figuring out the value, that's
going to be challenging.

502
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,210
So we're going to take
that first challenge

503
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,290
to start with, and try
to understand valuation.

504
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,910
I'm going to argue
that all business

505
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,970
decisions, any kind
of business decision,

506
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,010
involves those two challenges.

507
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,750
Valuing something, and
then once you value it,

508
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,180
make a decision on what you
want to do with that value.

509
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,740
This is why I've
argued that finance

510
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,281
is the most important subject,
because literally any business

511
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,270
decision that you
will ever engage in,

512
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,860
constitutes those
two components.

513
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,710
Valuation and management.

514
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,570
Now valuation is going to
be a challenge by itself,

515
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,060
because it's not at all clear
what value we're talking about.

516
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,980
In other words, what is value?

517
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,090
Is water valuable?

518
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,920
Well, life can't be
sustained without it.

519
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,140
At least carbon
based forms of life.

520
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,640
So water is pretty valuable.

521
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,650
But water is not that expensive.

522
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,140
At least before Poland
Springs came along.

523
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,190
Now what about diamonds?

524
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,000
As far as I know, humans do
not need diamonds to survive,

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,240
and yet diamonds are
extraordinarily expensive.

526
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,060
There are certain gems
that are invaluable.

527
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,510
Now how can that be?

528
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,300
Clearly we have to
think more carefully

529
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,720
about what we mean by value.

530
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,840
And of course, once
value is established then

531
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,130
management is
relatively easy to do.

532
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,690
Objectives plus valuations
obviously leads to decisions.

533
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,310
So once you tell me what
you're trying to achieve,

534
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,340
and then you value all
the various different

535
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,640
possibilities, then I can tell
you what the right decision is.

536
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,330
Pick the decision that is the
most valuable for achieving

537
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,470
the objectives that you want.

538
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,680
Now that doesn't
really help a lot

539
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,010
if we can't apply this
to specific contexts,

540
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,414
and come up with specific value.

541
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,080
So I want to hammer
this home, and to do

542
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,820
that I want to talk about how it
is that financial markets helps

543
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,260
us establish value through
the price discovery mechanism.

544
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,760
And to do that, I am going
to do a simple demonstration.

545
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,410
Now when I was growing
up I went to one

546
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,070
of these specialized
high schools

547
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
that focused on science.

548
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,570
So we were always getting
these various different kinds

549
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,287
of neat demonstrations of
the Tesla kind of coil.

550
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,620
I've always been very jealous
of these science teachers,

551
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,750
because they have these
cool demonstrations that we

552
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,130
in finance don't.

553
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,140
So I've developed a little
demonstration of my own.

554
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,770
It's a simple one that has to
do with the price discovery

555
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,840
mechanism, and because
I teach two sections,

556
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,010
I'm going to have to
make it a little bit more

557
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,240
involved than normally.

558
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,190
So I need two volunteers.

559
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,562
The first volunteer-- thank you.

560
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,520
I'd like you to take
these two pieces of paper,

561
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,050
these are blank pieces of paper.

562
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,432
On one of them write heads,
and the other write tails.

563
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:47,390
And then place them face
down, and shuffle them

564
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,010
so you don't know
which is which.

565
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,400
And I need another volunteer who
has a coin that they can flip,

566
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,340
because-- thank you.

567
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,557
So as soon as he's
done, I'm going

568
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:58,640
to ask you to flip a coin.

569
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,690
Do you have a coin by the way?

570
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,314
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

571
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,920
ANDREW W. LO: OK.

572
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,510
I have two items here.

573
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,050
One of which is going to be
auctioned off in this section,

574
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,800
and the other is going
to be auctioned off

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,830
in the later section.

576
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,830
And since I don't know
what your preferences are

577
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,360
for one or the other, I
want to randomize this

578
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,580
so that there's no chance that I
favor one section or the other.

579
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,780
So are you done with that?

580
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,530
You shuffled them.

581
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,610
You don't know which is which.

582
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,818
OK, I'd like you to take
these two face down, and put

583
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:25,990
one in front of one
of these packages,

584
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,800
and the other in front of
the other face down as well.

585
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,169
While you do that, can you
go ahead and flip your coin?

586
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:34,710
And as soon as he
puts that on there,

587
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,320
I want you to tell me whether
you flipped heads or tails.

588
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,140
And based upon that,
the particular object

589
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,940
that is chosen will be auctioned
off in this particular section.

590
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,540
OK, go ahead.

591
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,754
What have you got?

592
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:47,420
AUDIENCE: Tails.

593
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,630
ANDREW W. LO: Tails, OK.

594
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,310
So tails.

595
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,850
This is heads,
and this is tails.

596
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,647
So here is the item that
I'm going to auction off.

597
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,480
Before I do that, I'm
going to ask somebody.

598
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
Anybody know what's in here?

599
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,290
Nobody knows what's in that box?

600
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,090
Well, what do you
think its value is?

601
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,550
Zero?

602
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,049
Negative?

603
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,090
Can't be negative, right?

604
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,630
There's limited liabilities.

605
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,500
You can't owe me for
something that's in there.

606
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,250
So good.

607
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,750
We've established
some information.

608
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,210
There's a zero lower bound.

609
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,634
Well, I don't know
what the value is.

610
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:31,050
So what we're going to do is
we're going to figure it out.

611
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,130
Rather, you're going
to figure it out.

612
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,210
I'm going to auction this
off, and now this is for real.

613
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,690
So don't bid if you can't
pay me, and by the way,

614
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,810
I expect to be paid in cash.

615
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,100
All right?

616
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,280
So I'm serious.

617
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,650
This is a serious game.

618
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,150
So if you don't
want to participate,

619
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,280
you're not prepared to
pay me in cash at the end

620
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,320
of this lecture, do not bid.

621
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,970
All right?

622
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,370
OK, I'm going to open it up.

623
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,204
Anybody want to start
bidding for this item?

624
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:04,970
AUDIENCE: $1.

625
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,310
ANDREW W. LO: $1.

626
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,230
AUDIENCE: Three.

627
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,766
ANDREW W. LO: $3.

628
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:09,662
AUDIENCE: $4.

629
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:10,427
AUDIENCE: Four.

630
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:11,010
AUDIENCE: Six.

631
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,185
ANDREW W. LO: Six.

632
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:12,810
AUDIENCE: Five.

633
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,650
ANDREW W. LO: All right,
$6 is the high bid.

634
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,650
Can't do that.

635
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,250
All right, $6 is the high bid.

636
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,547
AUDIENCE: Ten.

637
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:22,130
AUDIENCE: Ten.

638
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,879
ANDREW W. LO: Ten.

639
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:23,940
OK, we got two tens here.

640
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,731
You were the first.

641
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:25,650
So that's your bid.

642
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,834
Your bid is the high bid. $10.

643
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:28,640
AUDIENCE: 20.

644
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,390
ANDREW W. LO: 20.

645
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,490
We have 20.

646
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,034
Wow!

647
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:31,950
AUDIENCE: High roller.

648
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,120
ANDREW W. LO: $20.

649
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,120
You do see that this package is
smaller than this one, right?

650
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,250
It's a tiny little thing. $20.

651
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,030
AUDIENCE: 30.

652
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,610
ANDREW W. LO: $30.

653
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,680
$30.

654
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,280
High bid.

655
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,986
Any more than $30?

656
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,690
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a question, please?

657
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,934
ANDREW W. LO: Yes.

658
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,260
AUDIENCE: Where does
the money-- who gets it?

659
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,510
ANDREW W. LO: I get the money.

660
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,820
That's a great question.

661
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,020
That's a great question.

662
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,720
This is going to go
to the foundation

663
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,810
to support Andrew Lo.

664
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm the charity.

665
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,930
So this is not a
charity auction.

666
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,700
This is going to go to me.

667
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,860
By the way, I paid
for these items.

668
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,054
So that's why it's going to go
to reimburse my teaching costs.

669
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:11,970
AUDIENCE: It's going to
ice cream, [INAUDIBLE]

670
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,890
ANDREW W. LO: Right.

671
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,040
OK, $30 high bid.

672
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,790
Any higher bid than that?

673
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,190
$30?

674
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,910
Nothing higher?

675
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,802
AUDIENCE: 31.

676
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:22,510
ANDREW W. LO: 31.

677
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,920
AUDIENCE: 35.

678
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,340
ANDREW W. LO: 35.

679
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,500
OK, do I hear 40?

680
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,910
Anybody want to do 40?

681
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,525
$40?

682
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:38,650
AUDIENCE: I'll give you 40.

683
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:38,980
ANDREW W. LO: $40.

684
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,135
All right, we've got $40.

685
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,267
Anybody willing to go 45?

686
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:47,766
$45?

687
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,929
All right.

688
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:52,470
AUDIENCE: 45.

689
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,360
ANDREW W. LO: $45.

690
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,950
Wow!

691
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,850
OK.

692
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,085
Do we hear 50?

693
00:30:59,085 --> 00:30:59,585
$50?

694
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,720
45 is the high bid.

695
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,507
Anybody for 50?

696
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:06,590
AUDIENCE: Can I short too?

697
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,790
ANDREW W. LO: No
shorting, sorry.

698
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,770
I'm the only auctioneer here.

699
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,290
$45 is the high bid.

700
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,220
Anybody here 50?

701
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,930
Going once.

702
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,040
Going twice.

703
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,404
All right, sold. $45.

704
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:21,820
Now you're going
to pay me, right?

705
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,403
AUDIENCE: Yep.

706
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:24,130
ANDREW W. LO: All right.

707
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,080
We established the value.

708
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,110
It's $45.

709
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,900
That's the market at work.

710
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,820
None of you knew
what was in here.

711
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,830
It could be nothing actually.

712
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,810
But I suspect that you
didn't think it was nothing,

713
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,760
because you bid for it, right?

714
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,100
Moreover, I didn't
let you touch it.

715
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,150
I didn't let you feel it.

716
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,080
I didn't let you shake it.

717
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,788
There was no information
whatsoever other

718
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,040
this very pretty packaging.

719
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,370
And yet somehow
magically you were

720
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,080
able to come up with a value.

721
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,550
Now we could argue whether
that value is good or bad.

722
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,920
But it's a number,
and it's a number that

723
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,160
can now be used for analysis.

724
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,041
Now again, I'm not commenting on
how good or bad the number is.

725
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,540
In a minute we're
going to find out,

726
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,831
because I'm going to open this.

727
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,790
Or let this gentleman here open
it, and see what he bought.

728
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,860
But before he does that, I want
to comment that knowing nothing

729
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,220
without any
information whatsoever,

730
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,910
we've established value.

731
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,960
That's remarkable.

732
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,500
Now it's not true, though,
that there is no information.

733
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,310
In fact, there's a
tremendous amount

734
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,260
of information in this room.

735
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,820
Tremendous amount.

736
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,160
Because you know a
number of things.

737
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,320
You know about the
size of packages.

738
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,600
You know about the fact
that I'm a professor,

739
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,960
and if I really cheat you
then I might get in trouble

740
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,190
with the dean.

741
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,450
There are a number of
constraints that are in place,

742
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,730
and with this audience those
constraints affected the value.

743
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,300
For the next five weeks that's
what we're going to be doing,

744
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,820
is talking about
valuation and trying

745
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,190
to understand how what
just happened happened.

746
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,380
OK, would you like to open
it up, and let us know

747
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,182
what you've got for your $45?

748
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:21,640
And you'll let me
know whether this

749
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,450
has been a good deal or a
bad deal for you and for me.

750
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,290
Oh, just rip it.

751
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:35,790
My wife does this all the time.

752
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,790
It drives me crazy.

753
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,280
My sons are just--

754
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,949
AUDIENCE: I'm enjoying
my [INAUDIBLE] $45.

755
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:43,990
ANDREW W. LO: Fair point.

756
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,670
Fair point.

757
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:52,606
AUDIENCE: Oohhh!

758
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:56,078
[APPLAUSE]

759
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:01,450
ANDREW W. LO: Anybody know what
the retail value of that is?

760
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,276
It's an iPod Nano 4 gig version.

761
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,730
AUDIENCE: 125.

762
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,159
ANDREW W. LO: 149 to be precise.

763
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,620
So you had a good deal.

764
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

765
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,120
Thank you.

766
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,679
ANDREW W. LO: You're welcome.

767
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,330
Thank you, because
what we did was

768
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,340
to engage in a price
discovery process

769
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,929
with limited information.

770
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,820
With limited information.

771
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,210
I couldn't get the value out
of that that I wanted to.

772
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,639
I would have loved to
have gotten a bid of $149,

773
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,730
but would any of you be
willing to pay that for a box

774
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,310
with no information at all?

775
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,510
Probably not.

776
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,389
So the lack of transparency,
the lack of information,

777
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,460
actually reduced the
value of that object.

778
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,190
But nevertheless,
it did have a value.

779
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,620
Because some of you were
willing to take a chance

780
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,860
that there might be something
interesting in that package.

781
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,639
That is what we're going to try
to understand over the next 13

782
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,460
weeks, and for the first
five of those weeks

783
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,000
we're going to try
to take it apart.

784
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,800
We're going to try to understand
how it is that the market comes

785
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,130
up with the value.

786
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,850
And it's going to
be a challenge.

787
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,180
This is hard to do,
because just like

788
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,970
if we decided to spend the rest
of the lecture figuring out

789
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,820
how you came up with
a $45 bid, or why you

790
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,670
weren't willing to go to 50.

791
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,220
It's going to be really
hard for us to tease out

792
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,990
all of the thinking that went
into this kind of discussion.

793
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,450
So that's why we
have work to do.

794
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,900
It will be exciting
work, because at the end

795
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,850
we are going to come up with
specific quantitative analysis

796
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,720
that will tell us how
valuation is done.

797
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,460
So that's where we're
going to focus on

798
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,630
for the next few weeks.

799
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,870
Clearly once we
figure out valuation,

800
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,730
we can then focus on management.

801
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,580
And the first
two-thirds of this class

802
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,920
will be focused on valuation.

803
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,150
The last one third will be
focused on taking those ideas,

804
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,920
and applying them to management
contexts like capital budgeting

805
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,870
and risk management.

806
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,270
For valuation, the
kind of questions

807
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,940
that we're going to tackle
are ones that implicitly we

808
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,860
did in just a few minutes here.

809
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,030
It's going to be how are
financial assets valued

810
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,520
versus how should
they be valued,

811
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,190
and is that always the same?

812
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,140
Is it the case that
financial assets

813
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,600
are valued the way
they should be valued,

814
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,960
and what do we even mean
by whether or not it should

815
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,730
be valued in a way or not.

816
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,870
And finally, we're going to
ask the question for valuation,

817
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,660
how well do financial
markets really work?

818
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,186
Can we always rely
on them to work well?

819
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:45,560
In this case, I
don't know if you

820
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,980
would call this
particular auction

821
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,594
one that worked out well.

822
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:52,010
Certainly worked
out well for you,

823
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,630
but it didn't work
out well for me.

824
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,250
So in what sense did
it work out well?

825
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,050
Well, it worked out
well in the sense

826
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,090
that if I really wanted
to get rid of that box,

827
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,396
if I really wanted to unload it,
I actually was able to do that.

828
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:07,520
And I got something for it.

829
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,040
Sight unseen, with no
information whatsoever,

830
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,050
I actually got $45.

831
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,090
Roughly a third of the
value of the asset.

832
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,490
That's actually not too bad.

833
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,460
If you're trying to sell
an asset sight unseen,

834
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,130
and you need to
do it immediately,

835
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,617
a 66% discount is
actually pretty fair.

836
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,450
Now we're going to see
more examples of that

837
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,430
over the next few weeks.

838
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,180
Once we determine value, then
the question is management.

839
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,890
How much should I save or spend?

840
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,200
That's a management
question that all of you

841
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,110
have to deal with at some
point or another in your lives.

842
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,890
What should I buy?

843
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,180
What should I sell?

844
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,220
When should I buy and
sell it, and how should I

845
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,840
finance the transaction?

846
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,330
Those are the problems
of financial analysis

847
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,800
plain and simple.

848
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,190
These are problems that apply
to Jack Welch, to James Simons,

849
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,990
to Warren Buffett, and to you.

850
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,040
And it applies to you not just
from the corporate perspective,

851
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,780
but from a personal
perspective as well.

852
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Every one of you have to
think about these issues

853
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,650
on a daily basis.

854
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,510
And so finance
really is completely

855
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,450
inclusive in the sense that it
applies to virtually everything

856
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,600
that you will ever
encounter in life.

857
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,350
To do that I have to
go over the framework

858
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,610
of financial analysis, and the
starting point is accounting.

859
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:31,540
Accounting is the language,
the lexicon of finance

860
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,670
in that it's the
beginning of how

861
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,770
to measure economic concepts.

862
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,230
Like profit and loss,
revenues and costs, and so on.

863
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,980
So while many of you may not
have accounting backgrounds,

864
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,380
you will learn a fair bit of
accounting in this course,

865
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,890
just because you're going to
have to in order to understand

866
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,410
the material in the lectures.

867
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,110
So you'll need to get
familiar with the basic terms

868
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,940
of accounting, and
in particular you're

869
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,870
going to have to focus on two
concepts that are probably

870
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,560
alien to you.

871
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,850
The notion of a
stock and a flow.

872
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,420
Now when I say stock, I don't
mean common stock or equities,

873
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,670
I have a different term in mind.

874
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,290
By stock in this context,
I mean the stock of assets.

875
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,290
The level of assets.

876
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:24,360
And by flow I mean the
rate of change of assets.

877
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,380
You know when I
was in grad school,

878
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,740
we started discussing this
concept on the first day

879
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,745
of macroeconomics, and
then one of the students

880
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,870
in the back of the room
said, excuse me, Professor,

881
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,600
but isn't that just the
distinction between a variable

882
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,750
and its first derivative?

883
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,400
And the professor was a little
bit taken aback and said,

884
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
well, yes, that's right.

885
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,180
But let me give you another
way of thinking about it that

886
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,400
is somewhat more intuitive.

887
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,440
And that is, think
about a bathtub,

888
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,840
and think about the
faucet turned on

889
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,200
and the water flowing into it.

890
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,770
The stock is the
level of the water.

891
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,910
The flow is how fast the
water is coming into the tub.

892
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,790
And so after that
explanation the student

893
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,160
still seemed confused,
and so the professor said,

894
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,364
you know what, some people
find bathtubs intuitive,

895
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:11,030
other people find
derivatives intuitive.

896
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,580
So to each his own.

897
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,680
These two concepts
are extraordinarily

898
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,720
critical to financial analysis.

899
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
And accounting counterparts are
nothing more than the balance

900
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,910
sheet and the income statement.

901
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,750
The balance sheet measures the
stock of wealth of a company.

902
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,280
What your assets are, and what
your claims on those assets

903
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,730
or liabilities are.

904
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,020
On the other hand, the flow
of wealth into a company

905
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,980
or out of a company is measured
by the income statement.

906
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,810
This tells you how
much the company

907
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:55,630
is making per unit
time versus its losses.

908
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,090
So the framework for
financial analysis

909
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,400
that we're going to be
coming back to time and again

910
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,620
is this framework
of a corporation.

911
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,200
A corporation has a
certain set of assets.

912
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,110
It's got claims on those assets,
which are called liabilities.

913
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,160
So this picture, this
snapshot, measures

914
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,960
the level of the bathtub.

915
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,700
But that's not
enough to understand

916
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,190
how a company is doing.

917
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,130
You also have to look at
the income statement, which

918
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,480
tells you the sources of
funds, and the uses of funds

919
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,950
over any time period.

920
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,600
Typically on a quarterly basis.

921
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,680
So we're going to come back to
this concept as the framework

922
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,510
for financial analysis.

923
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,950
And by the way, this is
the sum total of the tools

924
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,800
that Warren Buffett uses for
analyzing his investments.

925
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,010
That's it.

926
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,180
Believe it or not.

927
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Nothing fancier.

928
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,640
So it's an incredibly
powerful set of ideas

929
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,370
if you know how to read it.

930
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,380
That framework when
you think about it

931
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,440
from a corporate financial
decision perspective,

932
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,330
involves making decisions
at five points in time.

933
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,540
Corporate financial
decisions involve

934
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,470
thinking about how to deal with
cash raised from investors.

935
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,680
How to think about cash
invested in real assets,

936
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,820
and how to deal with cash
generated by operations.

937
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,450
How much cash to reinvest,
and how much cash you

938
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,070
give back to your investors.

939
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,610
So from this you
should get the idea

940
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,550
that as a corporate
financial officer

941
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,610
you are focused on
cash, the flow of cash.

942
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:45,220
In fact, cash you can think of
as the lifeblood of a company.

943
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,890
If you follow the cash,
you will eventually

944
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,400
hit upon every important aspect
of the modern corporation's

945
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,690
operations.

946
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,520
And as a financial
officer, you will

947
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,670
be responsible for
analyzing that flow.

948
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,400
And as a decision maker, as
a leader of a corporation,

949
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,130
you're going to have to make
decisions about that cash flow.

950
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,160
Jack Welch uses the
information to be

951
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,490
able to make those decisions.

952
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,840
But he doesn't just get those
decisions prepackaged for him,

953
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,210
he has to understand
what those numbers mean.

954
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,780
Just like Warren Buffett.

955
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,470
Now the corporate financial
decisions involved,

956
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,670
obviously, have a variety
of different components

957
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,440
from a perspective
of career paths.

958
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,160
From the management perspective
real investment decisions

959
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,290
involve two and three.

960
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,300
So if you're thinking
about investing

961
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,730
in a new division or
a new plant or getting

962
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,710
involved in a new
product area, you've

963
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,145
got to focus on two and three.

964
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:45,520
On the other hand, if you're
the chief financial officer,

965
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,853
and you're thinking about how
should the company finance

966
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:51,510
its operations, you're going
to be focused on one and four.

967
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,230
If you're the
board of directors,

968
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,620
and you're deciding how much
to pay out to the shareholders,

969
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,470
you're going to be
thinking about five.

970
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,890
And if you're
engaged in managing

971
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,390
the risks of the
corporation, you're

972
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,790
going to be worried
about one and five.

973
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,330
And ultimately your
objective as a shareholder

974
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,760
and as a manager
of this corporation

975
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,070
is to do well by the owners.

976
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,340
So your objective is to
maximize shareholder wealth,

977
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,800
and the framework
that I've introduced

978
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,750
is going to allow
you to do that.

979
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,480
Now again, this may seem
kind of theoretical to you,

980
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,380
and I realize that.

981
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,110
So I'm going to ask you to
make this more personal.

982
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,020
And to do that, I'm going
to ask you to turn this

983
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,690
into your own personal
household financial decision

984
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,260
making framework.

985
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,140
So I'd like you to
take all of these ideas

986
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,960
and literally apply
them to yourself.

987
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,680
Think about the
cash flows that are

988
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,050
flowing through your own life.

989
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,320
There may not be that much right
now since you're at school,

990
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,500
but believe me, it will grow.

991
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,400
So the household,
this is you, sits in

992
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,750
between real
economic activities.

993
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,830
In other words, your
job, and financial assets

994
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,880
and liabilities, which are all
of the financial transactions

995
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,170
that you deal with.

996
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,410
So this cash flow process that
I outlined for corporations, it

997
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,360
works for you too.

998
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,350
So there's cash raised from
financial institutions, right?

999
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:22,600
Like student loans or
borrowing or home equity loans.

1000
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,100
There's cash invested
in real assets.

1001
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,790
What's the biggest real
asset that you are all

1002
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,117
investing in right now?

1003
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:30,450
AUDIENCE: Education [INAUDIBLE].

1004
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,366
ANDREW W. LO: Exactly.

1005
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,640
Human capital, yourselves.

1006
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,250
Your own education.

1007
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,082
Cash generated by labor supply.

1008
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:38,540
Well, obviously,
when you get a job

1009
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,920
you're going to be
generating cash.

1010
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,740
Cash consumed and
reinvested in real assets.

1011
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,820
So consumed means beer
or pretzels or whatever,

1012
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,500
and investing in
real assets means

1013
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,580
you invested either in
yourself or you invest it

1014
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,190
in a home or your children.

1015
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,584
Those are real assets.

1016
00:45:57,584 --> 00:45:59,250
Sometimes they're
also real liabilities,

1017
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,960
but that's a separate issue.

1018
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,327
And finally cash invested
in financial assets.

1019
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,410
Most of you may not have
a lot of financial assets

1020
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,870
at this point, but you
actually have some.

1021
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,542
I suspect 401(k) plans,
retirement, Social Security.

1022
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:16,000
Those are financial assets that
whether you know it or not,

1023
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,490
you're invested in.

1024
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,730
And so when you think
about management,

1025
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,740
think about personal management.

1026
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,070
How are you managing yourself?

1027
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,820
You've got to think
about real investment.

1028
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,580
Consumption and financing,
savings and investment,

1029
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,790
risk management, and,
obviously, what is

1030
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,420
your overall objective in life?

1031
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,860
And what you ought to be doing
is with that objective in mind,

1032
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,710
managing your real
and financial assets

1033
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:49,680
to maximize the likelihood of
achieving those objectives.

1034
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,170
So what I'm asking you
to do is, I want you

1035
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,660
to take this course personally.

1036
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,130
I want you to take the ideas.

1037
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,380
Every single idea
that I mention,

1038
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,320
and whether I tell you to or
not for the next 13 weeks,

1039
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,120
I want you to take that
idea and ask the question,

1040
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,790
how does that make
my life better off?

1041
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:11,070
How can I use that in my own
personal management activities

1042
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,240
to improve the kind of
decisions that I'm making?

1043
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,600
Because if you could
do that, if you

1044
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,550
learn how to do
that instinctively,

1045
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,470
you will then take those
ideas and apply them

1046
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,661
to management contexts
in your career.

1047
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:23,160
And it will make
it much more likely

1048
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,170
that you'll get more
out of this course

1049
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,820
than you otherwise might.

1050
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,920
Now there are two other
factors that I describe

1051
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,520
that make financial
analysis challenging,

1052
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,970
and those two factors
are time and risk.

1053
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,910
I've argued before that
without these two elements

1054
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,440
finance is complete.

1055
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,600
There is no more
research to be done.

1056
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,810
There's no more analysis
to be done, and all of you

1057
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,520
probably will already be able
to intuit a lot of the decisions

1058
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,130
that you're going to
be forced to make.

1059
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,210
Because without time-- and
by time I mean decisions

1060
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,380
at different points in time--

1061
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:10,620
without time and without
risk financial decisions

1062
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,250
actually reduce to basic
micro economic analysis.

1063
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,130
If you've taken an undergraduate
course in microeconomics

1064
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,230
supply equal
demand, well, you've

1065
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,110
learned all there is to learn
about finance without time

1066
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,210
and risk.

1067
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,510
The only reason that
finance is interesting,

1068
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,460
the only challenging
aspects of what we do

1069
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,230
are because of time and risk.

1070
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,220
The fact that cash flows
now are not the same as cash

1071
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,550
flows later, and that time
flows in only one direction.

1072
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,020
In about four
lectures, I'm going

1073
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,390
to give you an alternative
proof of the theory

1074
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,720
of special relativity.

1075
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,050
And this proof will
have to do with the fact

1076
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,020
that interest rates
are not negative.

1077
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,900
It turns out that there's a very
deep philosophical connection

1078
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,022
between finance and physics
that we're going to get to.

1079
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:05,480
But this is something that you
don't need to be a physicist

1080
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,270
to understand.

1081
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,570
In fact, I'd argue
that Warren Buffett,

1082
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:13,270
although he may not be able to
articulate these principles,

1083
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,750
these are principles
that are somehow

1084
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,090
inbred in his worldview.

1085
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,410
He knows that $1 today is
not the same as $1 next year.

1086
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,870
And he also knows that
$1 today without risk

1087
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,810
is not the same as $1 today
with a little bit of risk.

1088
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,440
Even a tiny little bit
of risk, he knows that.

1089
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,220
And at the end of this
course, you will too.

1090
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,640
So risk we have to talk about
in a much more serious way.

1091
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,670
We're not going to get to
that for probably six weeks,

1092
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,170
because that's going to take
a whole different set of tools

1093
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,460
to understand.

1094
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,340
So what I'd like to do for
the first three or four weeks

1095
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,080
is to focus on
time and just time,

1096
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,630
and then I'm going to bring
in risk once we develop

1097
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,000
a little bit more machinery to
understand how to capture risk.

1098
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,700
And when we put
these two together,

1099
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,730
we're going to get
modern finance.

1100
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:13,220
So that will happen some time
in week six, seven, and eight.

1101
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,560
Now finally, I
want to talk about

1102
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,480
the fundamental
principles of finance,

1103
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,860
and then I'm going to talk
specifically about this course.

1104
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:27,440
There are six fundamental
ideas that finance has come up

1105
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,660
with that really will change the
way you think about the world,

1106
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,360
and you won't
appreciate it today.

1107
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,710
I know that.

1108
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,430
But I want to put it into
your subconscious today,

1109
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,000
because sometime over
the next 13 weeks,

1110
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,220
at least I hope over the next 13
weeks, your face will light up

1111
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,972
and you're going
to get it one day.

1112
00:50:50,972 --> 00:50:52,430
You're going to
get it in the sense

1113
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,890
that you will understand
at that point in time

1114
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,590
how these six
principles can be used

1115
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,160
to make any financial
decision that you need to make

1116
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,020
for the rest of your careers.

1117
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,310
The first principle
is pretty obvious.

1118
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,030
There is no such
thing as a free lunch.

1119
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,790
Actually all of
these principles are

1120
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,950
approximations to a
much more complex truth.

1121
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,370
So if you really want
to be strict about it,

1122
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,430
it should read, there may
be free lunches on occasion,

1123
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,470
but there's no such thing
as a free lunch program.

1124
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,149
There isn't systematic
free lunches.

1125
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:30,440
You might be able to find
one or two every now and then

1126
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,280
if you're lucky and
if you work hard,

1127
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,530
but systematic transfers of
wealth for no reason at all

1128
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,270
are unlikely.

1129
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,980
Second principle.

1130
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,840
Other things equal--
and this is a phrase

1131
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,417
that you'll hear economists
utter all the time.

1132
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,250
And of course, other
things are never equal,

1133
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,280
but let's pretend that they are.

1134
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:58,520
Other things equal, individuals
satisfy three characteristics.

1135
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,490
They prefer more money to less.

1136
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:05,250
That's often called
non-satiation.

1137
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,250
They prefer money
now to money later,

1138
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,840
and they prefer less
risk to more risk

1139
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,400
when risk is defined properly.

1140
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,130
Now I'd argue that
these principles

1141
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:21,070
are in fact fairly universal.

1142
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,130
Not that you can't find
exceptions every now and then

1143
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,590
for every individual, but by
and large over periods of time

1144
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:33,820
and over a large population
this is generally true.

1145
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,590
And if you don't
believe me or if you

1146
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,170
know people that don't
satisfy these principles,

1147
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,420
please introduce them
to me after class.

1148
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,240
I'd like to get to know them,
and do some business with them.

1149
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,830
Principle three.

1150
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,400
All agents act to further
their own self-interest.

1151
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,610
Now again, this is not
to say that there aren't

1152
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,530
Mother Teresas out there.

1153
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,350
That there aren't people that
care about the general welfare

1154
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,120
of the public.

1155
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,990
But economists in their
own unique and annoying way

1156
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:12,250
have been able to redefine
preferences to even argue

1157
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,630
that Mother Teresa is incredibly
selfish, because her utility

1158
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,540
function is the
function-- the utility

1159
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,200
function of other people.

1160
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,290
And so by doing all
this good, Mother Teresa

1161
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,260
was only furthering
her own self-interests.

1162
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,650
Isn't she so selfish.

1163
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,610
Now, so in a way when the
economist defines preferences,

1164
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,820
they almost define
it as a tautology.

1165
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,660
But finance makes economics
practical in the sense

1166
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,830
that I'll describe in
a few weeks exactly

1167
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,730
what kinds of preferences are
actually embodied in decision

1168
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:52,730
making, and why this principle
is more often than not,

1169
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,830
a pretty good approximation to
a much more complex reality.

1170
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,010
Now the last three
principles I'm not

1171
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,820
going to talk about in great
detail, because those really

1172
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,280
embody a much
larger set of issues

1173
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,840
about economics and finance.

1174
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,720
We're going to talk about
those three principles,

1175
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,350
but only in the last
lecture oddly enough.

1176
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,700
We're going to use them.

1177
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,650
We're going to use
these principles,

1178
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,160
but in the last
lecture I'm going

1179
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,090
to question all of the framework
that I've developed for you,

1180
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,400
and show you where
the holes are.

1181
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,140
For the first 13
weeks, I'm going

1182
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,880
to need you to willingly suspend
your disbelief as we describe

1183
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,390
the relatively straightforward
and standardized framework

1184
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,770
for thinking about
financial problems.

1185
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,340
And in the last
lecture I'm going

1186
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,530
to describe to you where the
approximations were made,

1187
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,860
and why you need to take
advanced courses in finance

1188
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,880
to fill those gaps.

1189
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,540
So with that said, let me
now turn to course overview,

1190
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,329
and then I'll take questions
about course mechanics.

1191
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:02,370
There are going to be four
sections of the course

1192
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,310
as outlined in the syllabus.

1193
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,230
The four sections are the
introductory material,

1194
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,420
which we've gone over today.

1195
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,190
Section B, which we will cover
for the next three or four

1196
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,830
lectures is valuation.

1197
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,530
Discounting and the mathematics
of net present value.

1198
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,410
Pricing stocks, bonds,
futures, forwards, and options,

1199
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,530
and the relative
kinds of issues that

1200
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,450
come up across those
different asset classes.

1201
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:34,390
Section C will focus on
risk, and introduce risk

1202
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:40,480
into the framework of section B.
So once we complete Section C,

1203
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,690
we will then have
focused on time and risk.

1204
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,110
And finally section
D will be how

1205
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,720
to apply those principles to
problems in corporate finance.

1206
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
What Jack Welch did
from 1981 to 2001.

1207
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,470
How do you take these
ideas, and apply them

1208
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:02,560
to practical circumstances.

1209
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,990
And then the last
lecture will be

1210
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,210
a lecture-- this is not
the same last lecture

1211
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,470
as other last lectures.

1212
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,742
I'm not going to die,
but so I don't mean

1213
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,950
to call it the final lecture.

1214
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,080
That sounds a little ominous.

1215
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,330
The idea behind
this last lecture

1216
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,280
is to put it all
together, and explain

1217
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,130
how these financial
theories interact

1218
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,610
with imperfections in the
marketplace, and what is--

1219
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,070
or is not good approximations.

1220
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,840
Let me talk about
course requirements now.

1221
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,900
Obviously the lectures
and the readings,

1222
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,320
and attendance and participation
will be an important part

1223
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,730
of the course.

1224
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,850
We are not going to cover the
entire tome of Brealey, Myers

1225
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,350
and Allen.

1226
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:48,800
This is a book, which if dropped
off of a six-story building

1227
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,020
could actually kill
somebody if it hit them.

1228
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,840
So we can't possibly
cover the entire textbook.

1229
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,040
We'll cover selected chapters,
but this is Finance 401,

1230
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,950
so it's an introductory course.

1231
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,450
And so the readings that you
are going to be responsible for

1232
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,575
are the ones that are
outlined on the reading list,

1233
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:07,280
and that I've listed
in every lecture.

1234
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,170
So for example,
chapters one and two,

1235
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,550
you are now responsible for.

1236
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,470
And we will be grading
class participation.

1237
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,430
So I expect you to come to
class prepared, and ready

1238
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,560
to discuss material,
and possibly

1239
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,170
questions that we may have
raised in the previous lecture.

1240
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,650
And there will be one
case study that you

1241
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,300
will be responsible for
writing up and handing in,

1242
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,430
and that will be worth
10% of the grade.

1243
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,790
And attendance and participation
will be worth another 10%.

1244
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,550
So that's 20% of your grade.

1245
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,300
And then finally the
midterm and final exam

1246
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,009
will be worth 25% and 55%.

1247
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:44,550
Let me explain a
little bit about how

1248
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,380
the midterm and final
exam works, because it's

1249
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,030
a little different in
this class than in some

1250
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:48,904
of the other classes.

1251
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:51,420
And by the way,
this grading scheme

1252
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,430
and the particular
mechanisms are

1253
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,680
identical in these two
sections that I teach,

1254
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,050
and in the sections that
Professor Wang teaches.

1255
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,830
So he and I have coordinated
to have the same approach, so

1256
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:06,560
as not to advantage or
disadvantage any one section.

1257
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,510
In your readings packet will
be a collection of problems

1258
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,590
that we've put together.

1259
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,120
And actually I don't know
if it's in there right now

1260
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,070
or if it's being
photocopied, but we

1261
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:22,800
will prepare a list of
problems that you can work on.

1262
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,880
These are completely optional.

1263
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,780
And there are far too
many problems for you

1264
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,654
to be able to do even
in one full semester.

1265
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:34,070
The reason we give
them to you is,

1266
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:39,669
because the only way to learn
finance is to do finance.

1267
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:41,210
If you come into
the class and listen

1268
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,240
to my lectures you
may be entertained

1269
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,270
for an hour and a half, you
won't learn the material.

1270
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,110
In fact, I've now changed the
way I talk about the course,

1271
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:56,060
and I don't describe what
I do as teaching anymore.

1272
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,260
Because teaching implies that
I can force feed knowledge

1273
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,250
into your brains.

1274
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,150
It turns out it can't be done.

1275
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:08,170
And my two sons have proven
that to me time and again.

1276
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,380
You have to want to
learn the material,

1277
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,850
so you have to pull the
knowledge from me into you.

1278
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,160
In other words, you have to
be an active participant.

1279
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,670
My 12th grade math teacher
used to say that mathematics

1280
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,500
is not a spectator sport.

1281
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,820
That's the same for finance.

1282
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,740
Finance is not a
spectator sport.

1283
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,360
You actually have to do it.

1284
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,080
You have to confront yourself
with problems time and again,

1285
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,870
and think about how to apply
the principles in our lecture

1286
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,120
to those problems.

1287
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,770
The purpose of a lecture is
to give you the motivation,

1288
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,500
and take you through the
most difficult aspects

1289
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,220
of the principles and the
theories of financial analysis.

1290
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,850
But it's your job
to do the analysis.

1291
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,310
And to that end we're going
to give you some motivation.

1292
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,370
And the motivation is that the
midterm and the final exams

1293
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,530
are structured so that
most of the weight

1294
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,970
is placed on the final.

1295
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,840
The reason is the
final is cumulative.

1296
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,830
So it's going to cover twice
the material as the midterm.

1297
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,160
Therefore it should be
worth roughly double.

1298
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,820
But the other reason is
that financial analysis

1299
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,630
is alien to the typical
human cognitive process.

1300
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:21,040
None of you are hard wired to
engage in net present value

1301
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,660
calculations.

1302
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,450
And so it's going to take
some time before you get it,

1303
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,380
before it sinks in.

1304
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,210
And I've taught this
class many times

1305
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:34,750
before, and usually somewhere
between week eight and week 13

1306
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,310
a light goes off in your
head, and you get it.

1307
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,350
And I see this by
the bright smiles

1308
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,070
on your face around that time.

1309
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:41,750
It could be because
you're getting

1310
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,680
to the end of the
semester, and you're

1311
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,300
glad to be done with the class.

1312
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,610
But I like to think that
it's because at some point

1313
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,380
you actually get it.

1314
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,510
In a few rare cases
it happens at week 14,

1315
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,030
which is not so
good, but hopefully

1316
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,550
before the final exam.

1317
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:59,800
Now in order to provide you with
extra incentive to do problems,

1318
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,160
and given this is an MBA class,
I realize that all of you

1319
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,660
have very busy
schedules, and you

1320
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,760
can schedule your own
activities better than we can.

1321
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,060
So rather than have weekly
problem sets that are due,

1322
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,393
and you have to hand them in,
we have to hand them back.

1323
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:14,000
It's a hassle for everybody.

1324
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,020
There are no problem
sets in this class.

1325
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,930
None.

1326
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,820
However, we're going to give
you a package of problems

1327
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,740
and solutions upfront.

1328
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,310
You'll get that within
the next few days.

1329
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:31,820
And I will promise you that
the majority of exam questions

1330
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,350
will come verbatim from
this package of problems.

1331
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,010
Majority.

1332
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,830
Meaning more than
50% of the points

1333
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,020
will come from the package.

1334
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:47,120
So if all you did was to
memorize this entire stack,

1335
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,550
you could ace the course.

1336
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,711
But of course,
that would mean you

1337
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,210
would spend enormous
amounts of time

1338
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:57,270
in finance, which is not
such a bad outcome either.

1339
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,940
So we want to do
this to eliminate

1340
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,166
a lot of the fear and anxiety
with financial analysis.

1341
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,040
It is challenging, but
it's a lot of fun too.

1342
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,930
We want you to have
fun, because that's

1343
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,600
the only way you're going
to learn this material well.

1344
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,170
So it's up to you as to
how much you want to do.

1345
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,359
The recitations will
cover selected problems.

1346
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,150
So you're not going to
be left on your own.

1347
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:21,589
The recitations will go over
problems and how to solve them.

1348
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:23,130
I'll do a few in
class, the ones that

1349
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,410
are particularly
challenging, but then you'll

1350
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,670
need to do more on your own.

1351
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,300
And if you do that, you will
be prepared for the final exam

1352
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,310
better than most.

1353
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:35,820
The other material will be
readings and lecture material,

1354
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,070
and therefore there will
be some customization,

1355
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,310
because my lecture style
is different from Professor

1356
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,250
Wang's.

1357
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,770
But the majority of the
exam will be identical,

1358
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:48,000
and it will be drawn
from these problem banks

1359
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,780
that you're going to get
a copy of in advance.

1360
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,940
Now frankly, I have to tell
you that I don't really

1361
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,970
like to give grades at all,
but I'm forced to do so.

1362
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:01,110
And so that's why we set up this
process for assigning grades.

1363
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,670
In fact, a few
years ago, I came up

1364
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,072
with what I thought was a
brilliant way to assign grades,

1365
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:08,280
but I haven't been able to
convince the dean's office

1366
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,750
to let me do that.

1367
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,040
And you know what it is?

1368
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,820
It goes like this.

1369
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,620
Let me show you.

1370
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:21,350
I propose to give everybody
in this class a B. That's it.

1371
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:25,400
Everybody gets a B.
Now before I do this,

1372
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,950
how many people
would object to that?

1373
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,640
Raise your hand.

1374
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,810
All right, those of you with
your hands up, you get As.

1375
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,310
Done.

1376
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,250
You see how brilliant that is?

1377
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,870
I get a grade distribution.

1378
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,330
No work.

1379
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,060
The only problem is
it only works once.

1380
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,910
And when you're teaching
two sections, so

1381
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,960
somehow the second section,
it doesn't work as well.

1382
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,230
So I'm sorry I have
to give grades.

1383
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,160
You're all adults.

1384
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,900
I realize that.

1385
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,760
But nevertheless, this
is a necessary part

1386
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,510
of the curriculum.

1387
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:02,590
So that's how we're going
to be assigning grades.

1388
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,457
In the last four
minutes, and I think

1389
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:07,790
I'm going to try to keep on
time for the entire semester

1390
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:11,510
so we end at five
before the half hour,

1391
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,420
and we start five
after the hour.

1392
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,330
In the last four minutes,
I want to tell you

1393
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,270
a little bit about how to get
the most out of this course.

1394
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,330
And we can take this up next
time if you've got questions,

1395
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:25,700
but I want you to spend
time thinking about this.

1396
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,960
Most of this course will
be devoted to theory.

1397
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,450
But finance is not a
theoretical subject

1398
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,060
unlike algebraic topology.

1399
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,980
That's a theoretical subject.

1400
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,610
I've never heard anybody
become a practical or applied

1401
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,530
algebraic topologist.

1402
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,990
Finance on the
other hand, there's

1403
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,540
no finance without practice.

1404
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,870
So while the course will
be focused on the theory,

1405
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,917
I need you to think about
the practical elements of it,

1406
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:55,250
and I'm going to help you in
a couple of different ways.

1407
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,130
One is by problems,
but the other

1408
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:00,670
is to encourage you to sit
in on a pro-seminar called

1409
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:02,882
the Practice of Finance.

1410
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:04,840
This is a new pro-seminar
that we're launching.

1411
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,160
September 17 is
the first meeting.

1412
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,687
It doesn't carry any units,
so you can come and go

1413
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:10,270
as you please.

1414
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:12,670
But it'll give you a sense
of the practical aspects

1415
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,340
of the industry, and in
particular information

1416
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,170
about the career
aspects of the industry

1417
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:20,380
like what are starting salaries
for financial analysts.

1418
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,330
Or how do I get a job
in finance if I don't

1419
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,646
have any background in it.

1420
01:05:23,646 --> 01:05:25,270
It'll go through
those kinds of issues.

1421
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:28,370
So I'd encourage you
to keep that in mind.

1422
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:31,870
The second thing is with
respect to the course,

1423
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,840
I will give you lecture
notes ahead of time

1424
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,670
for all of the lectures.

1425
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,980
I expect you to take a
look at them in advance.

1426
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,790
Just skim them.

1427
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,290
You don't have to
read them, and try

1428
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,580
to sort out what I'm saying.

1429
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,560
But I want you to
skim it at least.

1430
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,230
And then in class I urge
you to take lots of notes,

1431
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,410
because the lecture notes
are not meant to be complete.

1432
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:54,070
In fact, they are
purposefully incomplete

1433
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,890
so that you have
to use your hand

1434
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:58,570
and write down your
impressions of the material

1435
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,920
as I'm speaking.

1436
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,470
Because in that method,
you will actually

1437
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:07,450
absorb more of the material,
and it'll stay with you longer.

1438
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,670
I would urge you to review
the lectures afterwards.

1439
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:10,776
Review what I said.

1440
01:06:10,776 --> 01:06:12,400
Because you may have
heard what I said,

1441
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,710
but you may not have
understood what I said,

1442
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,020
and you may not be able
to apply what I said.

1443
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:21,350
So you need to spend time
afterwards soaking it in.

1444
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,940
I urge you to work
on the assignments

1445
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,950
in groups, but also alone.

1446
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,970
Because when you do the
midterm and final exams,

1447
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,610
you'll be doing them alone.

1448
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,780
So do both.

1449
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:33,080
Don't just assume that you
can do the same in groups

1450
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,240
what you will do alone.

1451
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,732
And finally, I would ask you
to ask plenty of questions.

1452
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:40,440
I'm going to manage
the class discussion.

1453
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,670
So that if we have time, I'd be
happy to talk about issues that

1454
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,550
are current and on your mind.

1455
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:50,330
Even whether or not you should
refinance your auto loan.

1456
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,520
We're happy to take those
kind of questions assuming

1457
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,220
that it's apropos, and
that we have the time

1458
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,720
to be able to cover that.

1459
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,950
I want you to get engaged.

1460
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,780
I want you to take
this course personally,

1461
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,446
because that's the
only way you're going

1462
01:07:01,446 --> 01:07:03,239
to really learn the material.

1463
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:04,530
All right, thank you very much.

1464
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,280
We're out of time.

1465
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,580
We'll see you next Monday.
