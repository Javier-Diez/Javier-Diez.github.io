RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
So today, my plan

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
is to finish the open
economy part of the course.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And we will talk about
exchange rate regimes.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But before I do that, I need
to finish a few things that we

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't in the previous lecture.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And that will help
as an introduction

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:84%
for the kind of things I
want to talk about today.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And let me start just
reviewing that last slide

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.238 align:middle line:84%
that we discussed, which is
the Mundell-Fleming model.

00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Mundell-Fleming
model, essentially,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
is our old IS-LM model, in
which the IS a little different

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
because now we have a
net export term, which

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is a function of new things like
foreign output, foreign income,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly,
the real exchange rate.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And the real exchange rate
itself, because of the UIP,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
uncovered interest
parity condition,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:84%
is a function of
expected exchange rate,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:90%
the foreign interest rate.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And it also gives
yet another reason

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
for why the interest
rate affects

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:90%
domestic aggregate demand.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:84%
There's the traditional
investment effect

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
of an increase in
interest rate, but we also

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
get the appreciation effect
of an increase in the interest

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
rate, which is contractionary
from the point of view

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
of aggregate demand.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is like that without
this extra net export term.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And in this diagram, we have
the same interest rate here.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
From this diagram, which
portrays the uncovered interest

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
by the condition, we
can get, for any given

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
international interest
rate and expected exchange

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
rate for the next period, we can
get the current exchange rate,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:90%
So that was our model.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And we did a few
experiments here.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
The first one was, well, what
happens if the expected exchange

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:90%
rate goes up?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is
which curves move?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the expected
exchange rate goes up,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
then I know that, for
any given interest rate,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the current exchange
rate will go up, OK?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I know that this curve, in other
words, will shift to the right.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know that?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, because if the
current exchange rate

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't move by the same amount
of respect to the exchange rate,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
now I'm going to expect--

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have expected
capital gain or loss, which

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
will be inconsistent with the
previous parity of interest

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have agreed that we had
certain expected appreciation.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.425 align:middle line:90%
So let's make it very simple.

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that this
interest rate happens

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to be equal to the
international interest rate.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Then we know that this
exchange rate has to be equal

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to the expected exchange rate
because you cannot expect

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
an appreciation or depreciation
of the currency if the interest

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
rates are the same.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But if now the expected
exchange in next period goes up,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and if the exchange
rate today doesn't move,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that would mean that you
expect also an appreciation

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.448 align:middle line:84%
of the currency, and which means
that investing in domestic bonds

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
would give you a higher return
because the same interest rate

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
plus expected appreciation.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the uncovered
interest parity condition

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
will move to the right as
a result of the increase

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
in expected exchange rate.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But that also means that,
at any given interest rate,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:90%
you get a higher--

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.387 align:middle line:84%
an appreciated exchange
relative to the previous one

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
before the increase in
the expected exchange

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
rate, which means that the
IS will shift to the left.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.835 align:middle line:84%
So if the expected
exchange rate goes up,

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that leads to an
appreciation, and that

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
leads to contraction
in aggregate demand.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Next experiment was,
well, what happens

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:90%
if foreign output comes down?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Well if foreign
output comes down,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
then this has nothing to do with
the interest parity condition.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it doesn't show
up in this expression.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But it does shift
this because it

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
reduces our exports for any
given level of interest rate

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:90%
and output.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.283 align:middle line:84%
And so the IS
shifts to the left.

00:04:05.283 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's contraction.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you
import the recession

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world, OK?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, people around
Asia and Latin America are very,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
very worried about
the-- actually,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the Europeans as well because
Germany [CHUCKLES] exports a lot

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:90%
to China--

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.833 align:middle line:84%
are very worried about
contractions in China

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and so on because,
through that channel,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
it's contractionary as well.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the other
part of the cycle

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%
because China is reopening.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of gives lots
of hope to Europe and so on.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why the euro has appreciated vis

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:90%
a vis the dollar recently.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:84%
And then the last experiment
that I don't remember

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
whether we finished or not--

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I said it very
quickly-- is, well,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
what happens if the
international interest

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
rate goes up?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
What moves?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.925 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
that will move is this.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
This was a parameter, OK?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So what do I know?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
That if I keep the
interest rate constant,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and the international
interest rate went up,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
what has to happen
to the exchange--

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and expected exchange
rate hasn't changed,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
what has to happen
to the exchange rate

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
today to be indifferent between
the two things, the two bonds?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is an experiment.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you were at any
domestic interest rate.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't touch that.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I increase
international interest rate,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and I say expected exchange rate
is the same as it used to be.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
What has to happen to
the current exchange rate

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to be indifferent
between investing in the US

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.868 align:middle line:90%
bond or the foreign bond?

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: It has to go down.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.715 align:middle line:90%
It has to depreciate.

00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So that the uncovered
interest parity [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.732 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
That's correct,

00:05:43.732 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
but why is it that you need
the exchange falls today

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
in order to restore--

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to have the interest
parity condition holding?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember what happened is
that you had the same interest

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And now the international
interest rate went up.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:90%
That means it's nothing moves.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Now you prefer-- you
were indifferent before.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you would prefer to invest
in the international bond.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
If I don't change
the US rate, then I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
have to compensate you
by some other means.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.772 align:middle line:84%
The only way I
can compensate you

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:84%
in this model, the only
thing that's endogenous

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.138 align:middle line:84%
is by an expected appreciation
of the exchange rate

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
because that would
give you a capital

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
gain from holding the bond,
the US bond, a currency capital

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
gain.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the expected
exchange rate is given,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can give
you that is depreciating

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%
the currency today.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So then you can expect
an appreciation tomorrow,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:90%
from today to tomorrow.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's the mechanism.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means
that this curve here

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:90%
will shift to the right.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
For any given interest rate,
you need a-- sorry, to the left.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
For any given-- I made that
mistake in the previous lecture

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So for any given
interest rate, this curve

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.305 align:middle line:84%
will have to move
to the left, OK?

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So if the interest
rate doesn't change,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.513 align:middle line:84%
and international
interest rate is up,

00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
you need an exchange
rate today that

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:90%
is lower than it used to be.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can expect an
appreciation from now

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to the next period, OK?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's when it
moves to the left.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happens?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:90%
What else moves in that case?

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I'm asking
the question, what else moves,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when a curve
moves, what you need to do

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is just take something
as given and then

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
see whether we get the same
equilibrium output or not.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take an
interest rate as given--

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
that's the easiest-- and
then ask the question, well,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.548 align:middle line:84%
will I get the same
equilibrium output or not?

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
If I get the same
equilibrium output,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.977 align:middle line:90%
that means the IS doesn't move.

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But if I get a different
equilibrium output,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
it means the IS has moved
because, for the same interest

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
rate, I'm getting a
different equilibrium output.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:90%
So what happens in this case?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Does IS move or not?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.675 align:middle line:90%
When IS star goes up?

00:07:52.675 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.515 align:middle line:84%
Going to simplify the
question-- yes, it does.

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:08.505 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Which way?

00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Will I get more or less output
when the international interest

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:90%
rate goes up?

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking-- look the kinds
of things I'm taking as given.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm also taking as given
international output.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not moving Y star.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
I'm not moving
expected exchange rate.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking the question,
if the domestic central bank--

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
the Fed, in the case
of the US-- does not

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.062 align:middle line:84%
change the interest rate, what
happens to equilibrium output?

00:08:42.062 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Does it go down or up?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
If the international
interest rate goes up,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:90%
the domestic interest does not.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
What has to happen
to the exchange rate?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.387 align:middle line:90%
You answered it before.

00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Goes down.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
It has to go down.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:90%
That means it has to depreciate.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
net exports when

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:90%
the exchange rate depreciates?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean that
exchange rate depreciate,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
especially if you have
the-- in this case,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.133 align:middle line:84%
we have the price
is completely fixed.

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:14.175 align:middle line:84%
So now, if the nominal
exchange rate depreciates,

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
it means that the real
exchange rate depreciates.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.857 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:22.565 align:middle line:90%
What got cheaper?

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, you need in order
to study for the quiz.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Domestic goods are cheaper.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:90%
So that means that--

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and equivalently, foreign
goods got more expensive.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:84%
That means, for any given level
of domestic interest rate,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
now there will be less
imports and more exports.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
That means net
export will be more,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.015 align:middle line:84%
which means the IS will
shift to the right, OK?

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.407 align:middle line:84%
So these things you
need to control.

00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I understand that it's a
little confusing to think

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:90%
about exchange rates and so on.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So anything that happens
here with the exchange rate

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:90%
is just a relative price.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The more expensive
are your goods,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the harder it will be
to sell them [CHUCKLES]

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and the more tempted you
will be to buy foreign goods.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's contraction,
appreciation or contraction

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:90%
here or not.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Here, the story's
a little different.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all about equalizing
expected returns.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have a movement
in the exchange rate today

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
so that you are always
indifferent between investing

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.477 align:middle line:90%
in one side or the other.

00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:38.935 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
return, the expected

00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:90%
exchange in the exchange rate.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So OK, good.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.505 align:middle line:84%
OK, I got this a little
unclear, but [CHUCKLES]

00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:50.255 align:middle line:90%
we'll keep trying.

00:10:50.255 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
particularly unclear?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Or it's all a blur?

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] OK, got it.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me-- so all
of this I describe here

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
is allowing the
exchange rate to move.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, look, if we move
something or the foreigners move

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:84%
something, then we ask
the question, well,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
what does the exchange
rate has to do today here?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And typically, when
that's done, we

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
call those regimes
floating exchange rate

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
systems, meaning the exchange
rate can float, can move around.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
As interest rates in different
parts of the world change,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:84%
then the exchange
rate moves around.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We typically call that
flexible exchange rate.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the distinction is a
lot harder to make in practice,

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but-- for reasons
I'll explain later.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's what is meant
as a floating exchange rate

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
system, one in which
really you're doing--

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
each country is doing its own
policies and so on, and exchange

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
it does what it needs to do so
the financial markets clear.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Many countries,
however, do something

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the polar opposite of
that, which is called a fixed

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:90%
exchange rate regime.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So some countries really
peg their currencies

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
to a major currency.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
An extreme case is the
eurozone, where they gave up

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
their individual currencies and
they have a common currency.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So Germany and Italy have
an ultra peg exchange rate

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because they have the
same currency, OK?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the times,
fixed exchange rates

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:90%
are a little weaker than that.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Hong Kong dollar

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
has been pegged to the
dollar for a long time,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
for the US dollar
for a long time.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you a few others.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Many countries go
through some phase

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
where they tried to
peg the currency,

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and it typically
fails at some point.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But they have periods in
which the currency is pegged.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- suppose that you
have a pegged exchange rate.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you
some features of it.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you are in a peg or
a fixed exchange rate regime

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
pegged to another currency.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.157 align:middle line:90%
And suppose this is credible.

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a big issue with
fixed exchange rate,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
but suppose it's credible.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.367 align:middle line:84%
There are some countries that
have credible fixed exchange

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have a fixed
exchange rate with respect

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to some other currency,
and it's credible,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.298 align:middle line:84%
then you know the
expected exchange

00:13:26.298 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
rate is equal to exchange
rate and equal to a constant.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means to have
a fixed exchange rate, OK?

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:90%
It's constant.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But if this is constant,
means you never

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
can expect an appreciation
or depreciation

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:90%
because it's constant.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
It's fixed.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't expect an
appreciation or depreciation,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
then uncovered interest parity
condition tells you that--

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
what does it tell you?

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
That your interest
rate has to be the same

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:90%
as the foreign interest rate.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.103 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
in a credible peg,

00:14:02.103 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
in a credible fixed exchange
rate if the domestic interest

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
rate is higher than
international--

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
than the currency, the interest
rate of the country you

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:90%
are pegging to?

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that-- I mean,
a fixed exchange rate,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
same interest rate,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and now, you unilaterally
decide to raise interest rates.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.322 align:middle line:84%
What do you think would
happen with capital flows?

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
What would you do
to your portfolio?

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:84%
If the exchange rate is
pegged and is credible,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
it is as if they were
issuing the same currency

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
because it's the same--

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a different
currency, different name,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:84%
but it has a constant
in front of it, OK?

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if it was issued
in the same currency.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Two bonds that are identical
and issued in the same currency

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
cannot be paying
different interest rates,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
because you would all invest all
your money in the bond that is

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
paying a high interest rate.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens here.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.812 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- mechanically,
what would happen is,

00:14:59.812 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
for some crazy reason, a country
has a fixed exchange rate,

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
credible fixed exchange rate
decides to have an interest rate

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
higher than the currency, the
interest rate in the currency

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
it's being pegged to, then you
will see massive capital flows

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to that country.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.112 align:middle line:84%
So there will be an enormous
pressure for an appreciation

00:15:16.112 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:90%
of that currency.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But what the central
bank would have to do

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is start buying
massive amounts of--

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
supplying massive
amounts of currency

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
for those that want to
buy it because there

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
would be an infinite
demand for that, OK?

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So in practice,
what that means--

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you can do
that for a little while,

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
but not in a sustained manner.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in practice
is that, if you really

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
have a pegged exchange rate, and
you have free capital mobility,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
which is people can move
in and out of your bonds--

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:90%
China doesn't, for example.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So it can allow
itself to both control

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:90%
a little bit the currency and--

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:90%
eh, eh be semi-pegged.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And it still can move its
domestic interest rate

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.045 align:middle line:84%
because they have
capital controls.

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
capital controls,

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.623 align:middle line:84%
and people can move
money in and out,

00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
it can do portfolio
investment, as it happened

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
with most of the
advanced economies, then,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:22.880 align:middle line:84%
effectively, you give up
domestic monetary policy

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because whatever the
other country does,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
the country you're pegging
to does, you have to follow.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it means.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
You peg-- you give up your
domestic monetary policy

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.925 align:middle line:84%
if you choose to peg
to another country.

00:16:37.925 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
A little later, I'm going
to tell you why countries

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:90%
may choose to do that.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.530 align:middle line:90%
But that's what you do.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And the uncovered
interest parity

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:90%
tells you that's what you do.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be able
to deviate very significantly

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
from the interest rate that
the other country's setting

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
if you want to maintain
your fixed exchange rate.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, in practice, there
are many hybrid regimes.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
There are very, very
few pure float regimes--

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:90%
a few.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe five or
something like that.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
So there are all sorts of
degrees of exchange rate regimes

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
which are hybrids between
fixed exchange rates and fully

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:90%
flexible exchange rates.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you just a few
randomly-- more or less

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:90%
randomly selected in Bloomberg.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So there you have in
white is the US-euro.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a float.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a cleanest
float you can imagine.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there is no--

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
then another which
is a very clean float

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:90%
is the dollar-yen, Japanese yen.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a currency
that has that freely float.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But if there is a
major dislocation,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:84%
central banks do
intervene to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.922 align:middle line:84%
It means, in normal
circumstances, they float.

00:17:55.922 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And the same is
true with the euro.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a big
dislocation, some major bank

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
collapses or
something like that,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
then there are
major dislocations

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.045 align:middle line:90%
in financial markets.

00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:06.170 align:middle line:90%
They become very segmented.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Arbitrage is not
that easy and so on.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Then central banks intervene.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But for the normal business
cycle and so on, they do not.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't intervene
in the currency market.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:90%
The intervene in different ways.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.998 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reason--

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll get there.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And the other one is the pound.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Now the US dollar versus
the British pound,

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:90%
then it's also as a pure float.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
These are also pure float.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the US versus
the Aussie dollar

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and against the Canadian dollar
and against the Swedish krona.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.727 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty
floating regimes.

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They are a little different
from the previous ones

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I showed you because
these are currencies

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
that are much more
prone to sell off

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
during risk-off environments.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason you
see these spikes here, OK?

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:90%
This was COVID-- biggest spike.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.952 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see it
in the dollar-euro

00:19:06.952 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.868 align:middle line:84%
So these are currencies
that are free floaters,

00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but they're very exposed
to risk, the risk

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
environment in the market.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.952 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
they're free floaters.

00:19:15.952 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.642 align:middle line:84%
The Swedes are a little bit
more independent-minded.

00:19:21.642 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But they do control a
bit more of the currency.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But still, I consider
those free floaters.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
These are currencies that
are a little different.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the Brazilian real.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The ZAR is the
South African Rand.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is the Colombian peso.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And you see several things here.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
They do move, so they have a big
component of flexible exchange

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They do intervene
a lot more, though,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:84%
because they are exposed to much
more risk-off type environments

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and so on and they need to
intervene fairly frequently

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to control movements
in the exchange rate.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But you also see a
trend in these things.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So their currencies are becoming
chronically weaker relative

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:90%
to the dollar.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
because there are countries

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.082 align:middle line:90%
that have higher inflation.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to maintain the
real exchange rate constant,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and you have higher inflation
than the other country,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
then your nominal exchange
rate has to be depreciated,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
because your prices
are rising at a faster

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:90%
pace than the other one.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.137 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the exchange rate
was not appreciating on--

00:20:33.137 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
depreciating on
average, then it would

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
mean that you were becoming
more and more expensive, OK?

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason countries
that have higher inflation,

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have these
trends as well, OK?

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
But it's still fairly floating.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Here, these are all currencies
that are, to a different degree,

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
targeted, in the
sense that they're

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
contained in terms of they're
not free to float at will.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:90%
The scale here will mislead you.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
If I had put it
in the same scale

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
as the euro-dollar
or the euro-yen

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and the dollar-yen or
the euro-yen as well,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
then these things would have
been-- looked very small, OK?

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So I should have put
a real floater there

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
so you would have seen
that these guys are

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.668 align:middle line:90%
moving a lot less.

00:21:18.668 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And these are different
kinds of countries.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the Hong Kong dollar
that, for all practical purpose,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:90%
is pegged.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
This little wiggles is just
technical things that happen

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:90%
overnight and stuff like that.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But they're pegged
to the dollar, OK?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So the Hong Kong dollar
is pegged to the dollar.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And that means they really don't
have independent monetary policy

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
relative to the US,
vis a vis the US.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:90%
This is the CNH.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:90%
This is the Chinese renmimbi.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a currency.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, I should have put it
with a real floater there.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot more controlled.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So it moves around, but
in a much tighter range.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And they are thinking
about exchange rate.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When part of their policy
programs and so on,

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
the exchange rate is something
they are thinking about.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.895 align:middle line:84%
This one here, the blue
one, is an interesting one.

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the Singaporean dollar.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And the Singaporean dollar, they
have a very interesting regime.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
They have a target zone, meaning
they let the exchange rate

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:90%
move within a range only.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's not pegged
against a single currency.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It's pegged against a
basket of currencies.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
And the recipe is secret.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.845 align:middle line:84%
So everyone is always guessing
what they're doing and so on.

00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
They do change the
weights a little bit

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:90%
to keep the markets confused.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:90%
But the currency is very stable.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
We all understand it's a
weighted average of the euro,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:90%
the renminbi, and the dollar.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But they don't disclose
exactly the thing.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But you can filter out
what they're doing.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And they keep things in a
range, and they occasionally

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:90%
change the slope of that range.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's very regulated
in that constraint.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they state
their monetary policy

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the effects.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
They said, that's our policy.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Interest rate is
whatever it needs to be,

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
so the exchange rate
remains in that range.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the way they state
the monetary policy.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.668 align:middle line:90%
They don't even think about--

00:23:26.668 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
so I let the markets
determine the interest rate.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.445 align:middle line:84%
We determine the exchange
rate here in that range,

00:23:31.445 --> 00:23:32.445 align:middle line:90%
and it's a narrow range.

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, I should have
put a real floater

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
that you would have seen that.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the point is
that everything goes.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts
of arrangements

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
happening around the world.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
These are different
kind of currencies, no?

00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:03.875 align:middle line:84%
This is the Turkish lira
and the Argentinian peso.

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I think, through this sample,
this has been called pesos.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Since they have this
very high inflation,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.043 align:middle line:84%
they keep changing the
name of the currency and so

00:24:10.043 --> 00:24:13.398 align:middle line:84%
on because you have to
remove zeros from things.

00:24:13.398 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think, through
all that period,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:84%
this is still the
Argentinian peso.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, look at
the scale, though.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So you cannot
see it, but all--

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
these two countries
are all the time

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
fighting against
the exchange rate.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Argentina today has,
like, five different exchange

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
There is the official
exchange rate.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.193 align:middle line:90%
There is the blue exchange rate.

00:24:36.193 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
There is the purple
exchange rate.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:90%
There are all sorts of things.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
You should never pay
with a credit card

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
if you go to Argentina
if you do tourism,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to pay
the official exchange rate.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You can get three times
that in the blue market.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't call it
the black market.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Since everyone does it,
they think blue is fine.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are all
sorts of exchanges.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But still this is
the official one.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And even the
official one you see

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:90%
sort of as completely exploded.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The Turkish lira
looks pretty good

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
here just because I put it
next to the Argentinian peso.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it also
would look pretty bad.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But most of these
countries are all the time

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
paying the exchange
rate because they use

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:90%
that to stabilize inflation.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing breaks up.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.957 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, they
go through big spikes.

00:25:19.957 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
You see this, for example.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.665 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
stabilize-- there you

00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:84%
see that they're trying
to stabilize the currency.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not floating
there, that range.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
They were a little
successful and [WHISTLES]

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
all the time today.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And now, obviously--

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
the size of this.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
This is an appreciation
of the dollar,

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.715 align:middle line:84%
so it's a depreciation
of the Argentinian peso.

00:25:44.715 --> 00:25:46.215 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is happening here?

00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.265 align:middle line:84%
It looks very
smooth, by the way.

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not that it's
moving around.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just [WHISTLES] What
do you think is happening.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Very high inflation,
in the thousands.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
is happening here.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is
a hybrid system.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
They try to stabilize
frequently the exchange rate.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.643 align:middle line:84%
The thing goes, and then they
stabilize it again and so

00:26:14.643 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:90%
on and so forth.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.165 align:middle line:84%
But you can't fight just
having much higher inflation

00:26:18.165 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the world.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.917 align:middle line:84%
You have higher
inflation, then there's

00:26:20.917 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
no way around that your
currency is going to depreciate.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:90%
They try to, but they can't.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so let me
go back to this model

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and think a little bit
more about the decision

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to have one kind of
exchange or the other one

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and therefore everything
that goes in between.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.195 align:middle line:84%
So remember, just to remind you,
that that's the model we have.

00:26:45.195 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So let me think
about policy first,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and then let's think
how do you deal

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
with policy in the different
exchange rate regimes.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll see
why would countries

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
would want one
thing or the other.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So suppose a country
is in a recession.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:90%
We're in this model.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And suppose that we are in the
flexible exchange rate regime.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So what should the
fiscal policy do?

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Suppose you are in a recession.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:90%
What should fiscal policy do?

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing unique
of closed economy here--

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.402 align:middle line:90%
in open economy.

00:27:23.402 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
In closed economy, you would
have given me the same answer.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a recession, what
will you do with fiscal policy?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Have expansionary fiscal
policy, increase [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So that means you move
the IS to the right.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Nothing changes in
the open economy.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.583 align:middle line:90%
You keep doing that.

00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that you get
is a little smaller multiplier

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
because part of that
will go to imports.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But still, it moves you in
the right direction, OK?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And yes, and countries rely
on other countries doing also

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
their own expansionary
fiscal policy.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But suppose we're talking
about a recession that

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.440 align:middle line:90%
is unique to this country.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to do an
expansionary fiscal policy.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:90%
What would the central bank do?

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.640 align:middle line:90%
In closed economy?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Drop interest rates.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.008 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Drop interest rate.

00:28:08.008 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, in open economy,
it does the same.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
You just drop the interest rate.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
will depreciate

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:84%
your currency, which will
help you, [CHUCKLES] as well.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's very expansionary
because of that,

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
because your currency
depreciates, so net export

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:90%
goes up as a result of that.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:90%
So you get the investment kick.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You lose a little bit because
part of it goes to imports.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But then you also get
the effect of net exports

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the
exchange rate, OK?

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy is a
great policy in open economy

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because it gets reinforced
by the exchange rate.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
It's even better than fiscal--

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.116 align:middle line:84%
other things equal, when
you compare the two.

00:28:44.116 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
The two policies lose power
relative to the closed economy

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
because the
multiplier is smaller.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.275 align:middle line:84%
But the difference is that
the interest rate policy

00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
gets an extra kick that
comes from the depreciation

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:90%
of the currency.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.145 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very powerful tool.

00:28:57.145 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you do if you
have a flexible exchange rate.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
countries do in practice

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:90%
when they are free-floaters.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have a fixed
exchange rate regime.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a credible fixed
exchange rate regime.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked you,
again, the question,

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.645 align:middle line:84%
what kind of fiscal policy
would you run in that country?

00:29:25.645 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:90%
The same, expansionary.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what you would do.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's effective, as
it was in closed economy,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.560 align:middle line:84%
a little less because the
multiplier is a little less.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
But no difference
in the analysis.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, fiscal policy has
exactly the same effect

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.045 align:middle line:84%
as fiscal policy in the
flexible exchanges in this case

00:29:47.045 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't moved
the exchanges in any event,

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:90%
in either of the two cases.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:90%
What should the central bank do?

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.949 align:middle line:90%
That's a trickier question.

00:30:00.949 --> 00:30:02.574 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If there's
a [INAUDIBLE] does

00:30:02.574 --> 00:30:05.273 align:middle line:84%
central bank know naturally what
the foreign country's doing?

00:30:05.273 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Yes, central bank knows.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:90%
So it will have too much.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.557 align:middle line:84%
So the central bank
cannot do anything.

00:30:11.557 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying suppose it is
an [INAUDIBLE] recession.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:90%
This country's in recession.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Now it wants to use his policy
tools to deal with that.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It has fiscal, but it
doesn't have monetary policy.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.345 align:middle line:84%
Unless the cycle of the
other country coincides with

00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
your cycle-- so it's a global
recession or something like

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
then you're doomed
because other country's

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.118 align:middle line:84%
doing the monetary policy for
what they're doing, what they

00:30:34.118 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:90%
need, not for what you need.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you don't
have monetary policy.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's a costly thing
of a fixed exchange rate.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We already said, but now
we're making it very concrete,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because we are in a
recession, and you realize now

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have a
tool that you had before.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's a cost of a
fixed exchange rate.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Here is an example.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Here, what I'm plotting is
the policy rate in the US.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the blue one.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the policy
rate in Hong Kong.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Very small difference,
but you can see that--

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:90%
these are technical things.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But you can see
that Hong Kong has

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to follow the US, essentially.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same shape.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So Hong Kong doesn't have
independent monetary policy, OK?

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, those are technical
gaps and not really--

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:90%
just look at the shape.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same,
not moving around.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So Hong Kong doesn't have
monetary policy, period.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Not something they have.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.770 align:middle line:84%
If they get a recession that
has to do with their own cycle

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and that is not a
result of something that

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is happening in the US,
they don't have the tool

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:90%
to deal with that.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, during COVID, and
during the global financial

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:90%
crisis, they were aligned.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So they [CHUCKLES] would have
moved in the same direction.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:90%
That worked.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But if there is a shock
that is Chinese-centric

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that is affecting Hong
Kong, the US monetary policy

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:90%
is not going to react to that.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And that that's a
problem for Hong Kong.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Still, they choose to do it.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:90%
A good question is, why?

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.548 align:middle line:90%
Always there is politics.

00:32:07.548 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:84%
There is more than
the kind of thing.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.632 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
economic arguments

00:32:10.632 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
for why you may want
to do these things.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Another situation
that I mentioned

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
happens all the time, every
other day in Argentina,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, is speculative
attacks on the currency.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have a
fixed exchange rate,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
but the markets
don't believe you,

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to be
able to keep it there.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And so what happens?

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:90%
So look at this equation here.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that you have
a fixed exchange rate,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
but now the market
thinks you're not

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to sustain it.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So that means suppose that
this guy starts going down.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This happens, again, in
Argentina, every other day--

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.113 align:middle line:84%
probably today,
every single day.

00:32:49.113 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
They want to say that they
want [INAUDIBLE] exchange rate,

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.947 align:middle line:84%
but the markets
don't believe you.

00:32:52.947 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And they expect your
currency to lose value

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in the next few hours,
in the case of Argentina.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.561 align:middle line:90%
So this guy is going down.

00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLES]

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
current exchange rate?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:90%
So expected exchange goes down.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.745 align:middle line:84%
Everyone expects your
currency to drop.

00:33:10.745 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
What will tend to
happen to the currency

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.745 align:middle line:84%
today, to the
Argentinian peso today?

00:33:19.745 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: It also drops.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.852 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: It drops.

00:33:24.852 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a fixed exchange
rate, you can't let it drop.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going to
maintain an exchange-- a fixed

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
exchange rate, and now you
have a speculative attack,

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
people think your
currency is going to drop.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
maintain your peg.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%
That's called defending the peg.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.533 align:middle line:84%
If you want to defend the
peg, then the only option

00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
you have as this guy is dropping
to keep the exchange rate

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.252 align:middle line:84%
is to raise interest
rates a lot.

00:33:46.252 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you fight--
the main way you fight it.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you fight it by closing
capital accounts and so on,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:90%
but that's the last resort.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You first try to fight
it with monetary policy.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So if this thing
is dropping, you

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:84%
fight it by increasing
interest rate a lot.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.843 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way you
stabilize the currency.

00:34:02.843 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
raise interest rates a lot

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to defend the parity, the peg?

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:90%
What is the problem of that?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.695 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.695 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Increases output.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.362 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Yeah, you
generate a domestic recession

00:34:20.362 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:84%
because just to defend
your currency, your peg,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:84%
you had to raise
interest rates a lot.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
So it means you're going to
have a recession at home, OK?

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's another problem
of fixed exchange.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.517 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem-- that's not
a problem for Hong Kong.

00:34:35.517 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1997.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:84%
They did have a speculative
attack despite the fact

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that they had twice
the number of reserves

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.755 align:middle line:90%
relative to their money base.

00:34:43.755 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But still, they had
speculative attack.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
But it rarely
happens in Hong Kong.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:84%
In Argentina, again,
every other day, but in--

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:90%
same in Turkey.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:90%
In Turkey, it's every 15 days.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's happening all the time.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's a problem,
as well, because if you

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.075 align:middle line:84%
have to spend a lot of energy
defending your peg, then

00:35:05.075 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
causing lots of recessions

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:84%
at home just to stabilize
the currency, OK?

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Thus, bigger economies
say, well, OK,

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
well, Argentina, Turkey, and so
on, but these are bigger boys.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Here we have-- this
is the ERM crisis.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So before the
euro, more or less,

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the eurozone plus the UK had
a system called the ERM--

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.085 align:middle line:90%
EMS, ERM.

00:35:35.085 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
ERM is the model.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, EMS is European
Monetary System.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
ERM is Exchange Rate Mechanism,
or something like that.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:90%
And they're both linked.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But let's call it the
European Monetary System.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And the basic idea of the
European Monetary System

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
was that they behave very much
like Singapore with respect

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to each other, meaning they
allow themselves to move around,

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:90%
but only in narrow bands.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The countries that
have the more stable

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:84%
domestic monetary position, like
France, [INAUDIBLE] Germany,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the Deutschmark, and the
French franc, where they have

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:90%
is bands of 2.5% up and down.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And they move
within those ranges.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a full peg,
but they allowed themselves

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:90%
to move a little bit.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Portugal, which was a little--
had a little less discipline,

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
they had 5% for each
side and stuff like that.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But the point is they would
have narrow bands, OK?

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And they moved around
in those narrow bands,

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and they kept their--

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:84%
kept it for quite a
while before the euro.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, here the whole system came
under a speculative attack.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
What happened around there?

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:90%
You probably have no idea.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
end of the Cold War?

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Well,
it's really linked to that, yes.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's the
German reunification.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, when East
Germany and West Germany unify,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:84%
they had to have a
massive fiscal policy,

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
massive expansionary
fiscal policy.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that big expansion put
lots of upward pressure

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:90%
on German interest rates.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And that led to
big appreciations

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Deutschmark.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And the other countries
tried to fight it

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
because it had to be in
this very narrow band.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But they were experiencing
these big speculative attacks.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to raise the
interest rate enormously.

00:37:38.765 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The UK tried to do it for a
while and, essentially, said,

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.040 align:middle line:90%
ah, we give up.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they
abandoned the system.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.572 align:middle line:84%
The French tried to stay in
there for quite a bit, OK?

00:37:48.572 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:90%
You can see the French franc.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.488 align:middle line:90%
They didn't move.

00:37:50.488 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't move.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was extremely
costly for them

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
because the interest
rate has to go up a lot.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they got into a
big recession and so on.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the whole
system broke up, broke down.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everyone left.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
rejoined, but now in the euro.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And the euro is a little
different because, in the euro,

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:90%
you gave up--

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
there's no space for
speculative attacks,

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
single currency, OK?

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's the most extreme form.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Speculative attacks
nowadays in Europe

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:90%
happen through different means.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the-- well, anyways
let me not get into that.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But here you have-- so I'm
saying having a fixed exchange

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:84%
rate is not easy,
even for countries

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that have sort of
very well developed

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
financial markets and
so on and so forth.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.085 align:middle line:84%
Now, it would seem, given
all that I said, that--

00:38:42.085 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is no reason to
have a fixed exchange rate.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It is something-- you
give up an instrument.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, you're
subject to speculative attacks

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:90%
all the time--

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.110 align:middle line:90%
not all the time.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends
on how bad you are.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
very well behaved,

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, you're
subject to speculative attacks

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:90%
So why not do flexible exchange?

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Why-- what is wrong with
flexible exchange rate?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the main problem
of flexible exchange rate

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:90%
is that it tends to move a lot.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that it moves
a lot more than fundamentals,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.168 align:middle line:84%
meaning productivity is a little
higher in one country than

00:39:20.168 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
in the other.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Demand is a little
higher than a country.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But the exchange
rate moves a lot more

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
than those little
differences justify.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason-- one way
of understanding this

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:90%
is the following.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And this will serve
as an introduction

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to the next topic of the course,
which will be asset pricing

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at-- revisit
our interest parity condition,

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
but now let's not
assume that the next--

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.188 align:middle line:84%
the expected exchange
rate is fixed.

00:39:48.188 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was an assumption
just to make our life simpler,

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:90%
but it needs not be.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's the uncovered interest
parity condition is this.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, I can
replace this guy here

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:84%
for what will
happen next period.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing shifted by
a period with an expectation

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So E t plus 1
expected-- this guy here

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 1 plus expected
domestic interest rate one

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.640 align:middle line:84%
period from now divided by 1
plus international interest

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
rate expected one
period from now

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.280 align:middle line:84%
times the expected exchange
rate for t plus 2, two years

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And I can keep doing this.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I can replace this by
something equivalent

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to that with all the subindex
shifted by one year, blah, blah,

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I can end up
writing this exchange rate

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
as this product
of lots of things

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that can happen in the future,
the monetary policy path

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
at home, the monetary
policy path--

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
not the next period, the
path for years to come,

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of a monetary policy
in the other country.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And there is always an expected
exchange rate at the end

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:84%
there that is free,
that can move around.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So the problem of this
exchange is that the future

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.170 align:middle line:90%
matters too much, in a sense.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And people have
lots of imagination,

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:84%
so all sorts of weird
things they imagine.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And when people have
lots of imagination,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.940 align:middle line:84%
then these things
are moving a lot.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason you
see enormous fluctuations

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:90%
in nominal exchange rate.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Now-- and that's a problem.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem to have
a very volatile exchange

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.550 align:middle line:84%
rate because it makes
transactions more difficult.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the price of things
are-- relative price of things

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.738 align:middle line:84%
are changing all the time, it's
a little bit more difficult

00:41:28.738 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to plan.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.745 align:middle line:84%
Financial investments
become more--

00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:33.120 align:middle line:84%
because you get
all this exchange

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.750 align:middle line:90%
rate volatility in between.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the main reasons

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:84%
you would prefer, if you could,
to have a more managed exchange

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It's because you don't want this
all this artificial volatility

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that comes from behavioral
traits and things of that kind,

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the main reason.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.067 align:middle line:84%
Look at this example,
for example--

00:41:57.067 --> 00:41:58.650 align:middle line:84%
example for example,
sorry about that.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But this is Russia
during the war.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:09.710 align:middle line:84%
This was the ruble,
the Russian currency.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And when they invaded, of
course, this thing collapsed.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.030 align:middle line:90%
The currency collapsed, OK?

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And this period is a little
longer than you think.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But it collapsed
for quite a while.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it recovered a lot--
actually overshot and came down.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is not because
the central bank said,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going to devalue
the currency or anything.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just people
said, well, this

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is a country going into war.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
mess, [MUTTERS] So all

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that future I talk
about, essentially,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.660 align:middle line:90%
destroy the currency, OK?

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of that
recovery happened there

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:84%
not because people now began
to see the future as a better

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.460 align:middle line:90%
future or anything like that.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:84%
It's because they have to
hike interest rates massively.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They were around
4% or 5%, and they

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.685 align:middle line:84%
had to go to 20% interest rates
to defend the exchange rate.

00:43:01.685 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you, you
have a speculative attack,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and you have enormous
pressure on your currency.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the main tool
you have to offset that

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.810 align:middle line:90%
is to raise interest rates.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So they hiked interest
rates massively.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They did a lot of
other things as well.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.080 align:middle line:84%
They put capital controls
on lots of things.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
main thing they did.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they dragged
the recession--

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
the economy into recession
for war-related reasons

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
monetary policy response

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:90%
they had to do with that, OK?

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's an extreme
case of a war.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's the kind of things
that can happen in a floating

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.420 align:middle line:90%
exchange rate.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Even when-- I mean,
the main constraint

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina and Turkey
and so on is reserves.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.273 align:middle line:90%
They don't have enough reserves.

00:43:46.273 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you have to defend
your currency by intervening

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.918 align:middle line:84%
in the FX market, if
you don't have enough,

00:43:52.918 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:90%
then you're not credible.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
massive capital outflows,

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and you have a few
billion dollars there,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case of Russia.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.740 align:middle line:84%
They had massive
amount of reserves.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.210 align:middle line:90%
So that was not the issue.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
expectations of things

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.063 align:middle line:90%
that happen in the future.

00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:11.405 align:middle line:84%
It was all about these
kind of terms, OK?

00:44:11.405 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so that added
to the cost they had.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So how do we choose these
things, then, in practice?

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Again, there are lots of things.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And politics play
a role and so on.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.050 align:middle line:90%
But there is a case--

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:84%
so again, I would put it
even the other way around.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that, if you
could, you would like

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:90%
to have a fixed exchange rate.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.520 align:middle line:84%
If you could, you would like
to have a fixed exchange

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:84%
because then you remove all
this spurious noise that

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
happens every single day because
of exchange rate volatility

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.910 align:middle line:90%
that complicates your life.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So when can you do that?

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, you can
do it with respect

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to some other country where
the shocks are very similar

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.150 align:middle line:90%
because if you know that--

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:90%
say your Mexico, but--

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.320 align:middle line:84%
or the north of Mexico,
something like that,

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.153 align:middle line:84%
and you know that all
your shocks are really

00:45:09.153 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:90%
shocks to the US.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Then the US can do the
monetary policy for you

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
because you have
the same shocks.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.710 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] I'm exaggerating.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.732 align:middle line:84%
So if you are very
similar, then it

00:45:19.732 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
makes sense to have
a fixed exchange rate

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
because why pay for
all that volatility

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to be
doing the same policies

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.755 align:middle line:84%
in both countries, more or less
at the same time because you're

00:45:27.755 --> 00:45:28.910 align:middle line:90%
exposed to the same shocks?

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:33.320 align:middle line:84%
That's one reason why the
eurozone is the eurozone,

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.180 align:middle line:84%
because there are
European countries that

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:84%
have very similar
business cycles and so on.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Germany is a little different.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason they
always have some problems.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the north and the south,
they're a little different.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're much more
similar than other countries.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they have one.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:46:01.765 align:middle line:84%
Another option is when you
have lots of fiscal capacity

00:46:01.765 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:84%
because, if you have
lots of fiscal capacity,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.980 align:middle line:84%
then the cost of not
having monetary policy

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.230 align:middle line:84%
is not that large, because
you can fight your business

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.030 align:middle line:90%
cycle with fiscal policy.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the case of
Hong Kong, for example.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Hong Kong-- Hong
Kong, first of all,

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.320 align:middle line:84%
is not subject to
speculated attacks

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because they have massive
amount of reserves.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.092 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that
dares attacking them

00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:90%
is going to lose their shirt.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So they're safe.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Soros tried many
years back, and he

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't do as well as he did
attacking the British pound.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But they also have lots
of fiscal resources,

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:84%
so they can fight their
domestic recessions and so

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.490 align:middle line:90%
on with fiscal policy.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The other factor, which
also applies to Hong Kong,

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.950 align:middle line:84%
if you have very
flexible factor markets.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So if wages move very easily,
prices move very easily

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.010 align:middle line:84%
domestically, then
you don't care

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.528 align:middle line:84%
about having a fixed
nominal exchange

00:46:51.528 --> 00:46:53.570 align:middle line:84%
rate because a fixed
nominal exchange rate is not

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.778 align:middle line:84%
the same as a fixed real
exchange rate, which is what

00:46:55.778 --> 00:46:57.410 align:middle line:90%
you really need to move around.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:59.035 align:middle line:84%
If your prices are
flexible, it doesn't

00:46:59.035 --> 00:47:00.952 align:middle line:84%
matter that the nominal
exchange doesn't move,

00:47:00.952 --> 00:47:02.610 align:middle line:84%
because the prices
are moving around.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you still have
lots of flexibility

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:90%
in the real exchange.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason I would say--

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.930 align:middle line:90%
it's one of the reasons--

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.100 align:middle line:90%
political reasons, as well--

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.480 align:middle line:90%
but why they can afford it.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the case of Hong
Kong, it's the other way around.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.997 align:middle line:84%
There were some
political reasons.

00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they built a system
so that it's a coherent system

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.260 align:middle line:84%
because they have lots
of fiscal capacity,

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
they can defend
the currency well,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and they have very
flexible market.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.402 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.402 --> 00:47:36.692 align:middle line:84%
This is-- well, again,
this is what I said before.

00:47:36.692 --> 00:47:39.985 align:middle line:84%
If you-- this is
what I said before.

00:47:39.985 --> 00:47:42.372 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like that
noise, if you-- especially

00:47:42.372 --> 00:47:44.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to be
trading a lot with people

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and so on, in
Europe, many people

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.480 align:middle line:84%
cross the border
many times a day,

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and you want to go shopping
one way or the other.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a pain if the exchange
rate is moving all the time.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.182 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier if
things are stable.

00:47:57.182 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And the same applies to
financial transactions.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:84%
People have deposits
in different banks

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.565 align:middle line:84%
It's better if you don't
have all that fluctuation.

00:48:05.565 --> 00:48:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the case
of the euro area,

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:84%
they decided that the advantages
of having a very fixed

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:16.090 align:middle line:84%
exchange rate were
more than the cost

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:84%
for individual
countries of not having

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.390 align:middle line:90%
independent monetary policy.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It's still a work in progress.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.557 align:middle line:90%
They're building that.

00:48:22.557 --> 00:48:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not finished, but
they're working at it.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The other reason why
countries fix exchange rate--

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
Argentinian reason

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- is when they
have no control on inflation,

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:90%
they have no credibility.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if you peg to another
currency that has credibility,

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:84%
then the idea,
the hope at least,

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is that you will
inherit the credibility

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.490 align:middle line:90%
of the other currency.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they tried to do.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Argentina had a currency board
like Hong Kong for a while.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea was
to control inflation.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's peg to someone.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And if the markets
believe you, then

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:84%
it would work because
then you inherit

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the credibility of the--
you're saying, when you take

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
a fixed exchange
rate, I'm not going

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to run monetary policy, which
is the main source of inflation.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to let the
credible country run

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:90%
the monetary policy for me.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives
you credibility.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.360 align:middle line:84%
As long as somebody believes
it, you're not going to [LAUGHS]

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.710 align:middle line:90%
quit the thing.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's the reason
countries do it, often

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.610 align:middle line:90%
to stabilize inflation, as well.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:90%
