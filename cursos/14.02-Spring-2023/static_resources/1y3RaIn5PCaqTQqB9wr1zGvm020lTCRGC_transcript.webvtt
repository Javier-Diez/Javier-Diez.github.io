00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So let me continue
with the IS-LM-PC model.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I want to rush a little
bit because I was overexcited

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:90%
with the SVB bank event.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make sure that you
certainly understand this model.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be very important.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's one of the most
important models in this course,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:90%
as I said before.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, I want to use it a little
bit more, this model itself,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to explain what is
going on right now.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Today, we got hit by a second
shock from the financial system.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's getting
exciting these days.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So let me skip all
this and remind you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
that that's where we were.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the IS-LM-PC
model, which I

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
said is nothing else than just
integrating the IS-LM analysis

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:90%
with the Phillips curve.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the IS part.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said at this point,
I will follow the book

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and assume that the central bank
can control the real interest

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
rate, rather than the nominal
interest rate, which is what

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:90%
really controls in practice.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to make that
assumption so the pictures have

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
less curves moving
around when things are

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:90%
moving when we do the dynamics.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a IS-LM,
nothing different.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at
the Phillips curve.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, this
is not very useful

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
because in the IS part I have
output here and in the Phillips

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
curve, I have inflation but
then I have unemployment

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to be carrying
around three variables,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
endogenous variables.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.338 align:middle line:84%
And so it's difficult to
diagram in three dimensions.

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything is less clear.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.383 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to replace this
unemployment here for output.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to do that
with the production function

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
we have because output is
just equal to employment.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And the employment is just
equal to the labor force times 1

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:90%
minus the rate of unemployment.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And we could define a
concept of potential output

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
as simply that output that
happens when employment

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the natural
level of employment, which

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
labor force times 1

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
minus the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And taking the difference,
subtracting the second line

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
from the first one,
you get a concept

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that is used very frequently
in macroeconomics, which is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:90%
the concept of the output gap.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
An output gap refers to the
difference between actual output

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and potential output, in which
potential output is nothing

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
else than the level
of output that you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
get when unemployment is at the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So we get the output gap is
related to the employment gap.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And now we can replace the
employment gap from here

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:90%
with the output gap.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with
a Phillips curve

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in the space of
inflation and output gap,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
which is something
we can integrate

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
very easily with the IS-LM
model that has output in it.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So the IS-LM model
is really combining

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
this equation with
that equation,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and some model about
expected inflation.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
IS-LM-PC model is.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So I gave you one example
here, 1 mole of inflation.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the case of the
central banks do not like,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
an anchor inflation expectation.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's my model of expectation,
then my Phillips curve.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I plug this into
my Phillips curve

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and I get this relationship
between the change in inflation

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and the output gap.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's an increasing
relationship.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm plotting here.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
For any given level, for
any given level of Yn,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
then as I increase output,
the Phillips curve--

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
the change in inflation,
the left hand side,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the difference between inflation
and expected inflation rises.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
this upward sloping.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this rises has
to do with all the things that

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:90%
happen in the labor market.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
If output rises, I mean,
unemployment is falling.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You need more employment
to produce more output.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
it's more wage pressure

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that leads to a price
pressure because there

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is a markup in between
wages and prices.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way you
get into inflation.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So I gave you one example.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It says, OK, suppose that
we have some equilibrium

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
level of output.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This, which is the result
of this monetary policy,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
this rate set by
the central bank.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the IS, which is a
function of the fiscal policy

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of the country, how
confident are consumers,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:90%
and all these kind of things.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So in quiz one, we really worry
only about this top diagram.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And all the shocks we
had were shocks that

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:90%
happened in this top diagram.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And we look at what happened to
output, to equilibrium output

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
as a result.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, this hasn't changed.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't changed.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
That block is the
same as it used to be.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
that we have here

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
is that this level
of output, which

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is the equilibrium level of
output at any point in time,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.038 align:middle line:84%
needs not be equal
to potential output.

00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And if it is not equal
to potential output,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to something
with inflation-- inflation,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
disinflation, or
something of that kind.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case, the
equilibrium level of output,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
which is still determined
as we used to determine,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
happens to be higher than
the natural rate of output.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And if output is higher
than the rate of output,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that means this is positive,
which means inflation is rising.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we see here.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
It means inflation is
above expected inflation.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
When expected inflation
is equal to log inflation,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
then that means
inflation is rising.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have here.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So any question about that?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- we
just, what we did

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is kept analysis we used to have
and now we added this diagram

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
here at the bottom.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out
that, yes, any equilibrium

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
here, if I move the
interest rate around,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change
the level of output.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
All those are equilibrium
levels output.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean that they're

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:90%
consistent with the natural--

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:90%
with potential output.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not equal
to potential output,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a valid equilibrium
at any point in time.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to lead to
issues on the inflation front.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
The second diagram
here tells you

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that we get issues on
the inflation front

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
with any equilibrium
level of output that

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is different from the
natural rate of output.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what this diagram does.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.338 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.338 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.963 align:middle line:84%
In the short run,
that's what it does.

00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So we keep doing what we used to
do in the first seven lectures

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And this diagram just
tells us what are

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
the implications for inflation.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:90%
That's in the short run.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The medium run, we said, is
when we start processing,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
which output converges
back to the natural rate

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to potential output.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it involves
the central bank.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that the central
bank is doing crazy things.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The central bank is reacting
to what the economy is

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:90%
telling it needs to do.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Here is a central bank that was
before doing whatever change

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
in the interest rate or in the
IS delivered the equilibrium

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:90%
output here.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Had an inflation of around 2%.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
That was consistent
with the target it had.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now suddenly it finds itself
in a situation like this

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%
and inflation starts climbing.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We get 3% one year,
4%, the next, 6, 9,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
in a situation like that.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very natural
for that central bank,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
if it's a responsible central
bank, to react to that.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the only reaction the
central bank can have,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
the main reaction can have,
is to raise interest rates.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what starts happening.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
The central bank finds
itself with inflation,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
in this case that
is accelerating.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It will start increasing
interest rate.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And this process of acceleration
of inflation in this case

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
would only stop when output is
equal to the natural potential

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.932 align:middle line:84%
And we can define implicitly
what that interest rate is.

00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can call it the
natural rate of interest rate.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call
it [INAUDIBLE] rate

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
of interest rate, neutral
interest rate, R star,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.783 align:middle line:84%
lots of names for
this interest rate.

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But this interest
rate is simply the one

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that gives us an equilibrium
output in our IS-LM diagram

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that is equal to
potential output.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Thus, that's all
that this Rn means.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm solving it as the
rate that implicitly gives us

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
an equilibrium
output here that is

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
equal to the natural rate
of output that defines it

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:90%
implicitly.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, there we are.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Is all that clear?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to have a
big chunk of your current pset

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
about this model and so on.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it
also in the next one.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, I think
this is important.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Then they talk about the
difference between anchor

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and unanchor expectations.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, here,
we have a situation

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that suppose we started at 2%.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we found ourselves
in a situation like that.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
That means inflation
starts building up.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:90%
We go to 9% or so.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So now the Fed
gets scared and it

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:90%
starts raising interest rates.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's moving
up, lowering output.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And as it lowers output,
reduces the output gap.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, reduces the
change in inflation here.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But inflation keeps rising
in this particular model

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
because expected
inflation is an anchor.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, suppose
that eventually the Fed gets

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:90%
to that interest rate here.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So we get to a
situation like that.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I ask the question, has
the Fed solved the problem now?

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, finally we
get to a situation

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
where the interest rate is equal
to the natural rate of interest

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
That tells me that output is
equal to potential output.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
That tells me here that
inflation is not changing.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Problem is that we already had
inflation of 9% at some point.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So here, inflation stops
rising in this particular model

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
with expected inflation and
anchor expected inflation.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But stopping is not enough
because that leaves us

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
with a level of inflation of 9%.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
That means that the Fed, in
order to bring back inflation

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to 2%, it needs to
go into this region.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So inflation starts coming down
from 9%, 7%, 6%, 5% and so on.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
anchor expectation,

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
an inflation
overshoots, you're going

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
to have to cause a recession,
and probably a severe recession.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:90%
There is no way around that.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Fed
has been struggling to do,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
is struggling not to.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the Fed, we are in a
situation-- not only in the US,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
but in the US in
particular, where inflation

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:90%
is way above the target level.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But expected inflation has
been more or less stable.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
talk about being

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
able to restore sort of
reasonable levels of inflation

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
in a soft landed manner,
with a soft landing,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that means that you don't
need to cause a recession

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:90%
to bring inflation back to 2%.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
You just can bring
it smoothly here.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
With this model of expected,
inflation doesn't work.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But if the bank, central bank,
has credibility and inflation

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
remain anchored, people continue
to believe that the Fed will

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:90%
go back to 2%.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't need to
cause a big recession.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you need to invest
in bringing expectations down.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you
can invest in doing that

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:90%
is causing a recession.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But that's the reason I said
central banks worry so much

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:84%
about keeping
inflation credibility,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise they
need to overshoot in order

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to restore a long run balance.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may wonder, well, I
mean, this looks pretty simple.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And just, if you have
a problem like this,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.020 align:middle line:84%
just go quickly to
that point there.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:90%
And then the problem is over.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't let inflation build
to 9%, or something like that.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:90%
You react immediately.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, there's
a famous sentence that

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
was coined by
Milton Friedman, is

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that monetary policy
acts on the economy

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:90%
with long and variable lags.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, it's very
difficult at any point in time

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to know where is
potential output

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and what is a natural
rate of unemployment.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you sort of sense it.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that the
only way you really know

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:90%
is by looking at inflation.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's inflation that
really tells you that you

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:90%
are on one side or the other.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to--

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you have some historical
average and so on.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.812 align:middle line:90%
But these things do move around.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's difficult to
at any point in time

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to know whether you
are at our end or not.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that here
everything happens immediately.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
If I move immediately, then
output immediately jumps here.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way monetary
policy operates in practice.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It takes time for monetary
policy to affect the economy.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the situation that
happened, I would say,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
until last week, was the
Fed knew that the inflation

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:90%
was still too high.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But it also knew that
it had done a lot.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It had hiked rates very
aggressively by a lot.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And since there are lags between
the increase in interest rate

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and the decline in
output, the Fed's concern

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
was, well, it's clear that
I still have inflation.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But it may well be the case
that when this thing finally

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
hits the economy,
it hits it too much

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and we end up in a recession,
and an unwanted recession.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
That was the concern.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.313 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is
happening right now,

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
there is a little
bit of a concern

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that we got to that point
because things were very

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%
slow for a variety of reasons.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:90%
But now something broke.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, now
that something has broken,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
will we sort of decelerate
the economy very, very fast?

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's a concern.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what is
happening right now.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
But that's what makes monetary
policy much more difficult

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
than this little
diagram, is that you

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
have all these lags, these
uncertainties, and all

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
these non-linearities.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly things happen.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you when things
can go really, really wrong.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not the issue now.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But we were very close to that
during the global recession.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Japan has experienced
several episodes

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
like this, which
is the following.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.747 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have a situation
where your inflation is low.

00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Typically, these things
happen in situations

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:90%
where inflation is low.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, your
natural rate of unemployment

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
is negative.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have inflation
close to 0, say.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the natural rate of
interest rate is negative.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have
a 0 lower bound.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a 0
lower bound means

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going
to hit this rate.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.797 align:middle line:84%
The best you can do with
inflation is around 0.

00:15:20.797 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you set the nominal
interest rate to 0.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the real
interest rate is around 0.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem is that at 0,
you generate negative inflation.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you generate
negative inflation

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and the nominal interest
rate is fixed at 0, then

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
now you get a positive
real interest rate

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because the real interest rate
is equal to the nominal interest

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
rate, which is 0, minus
inflation, expected inflation.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But if your expected inflation
or inflation is negative,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.530 align:middle line:90%
minus, minus is positive.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So that means your real interest
rate is actually positive.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So you wanted
something negative.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But you end up with
something positive.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
That means now you
have a big gap here.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So inflation, you
get into deflation.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Now inflation is very, very low.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:90%
It gets very negative.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, as inflation gets
more and more negative,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
your real interest
rate keeps climbing.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So you keep moving
further and further away

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
from the natural rate
of interest rate.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Thus, something that is
very scary for an economist,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that deflationary trap.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way you
get into deep recessions.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what happened
during the Great Recession

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The no, during the Great
Depression in the US.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
During the Great Recession,
we were close to it,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't get quite
there because lots of things

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
were done to prevent a repeat
of the Great Depression.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest problems
with the Great Depression

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
was that monetary policy was
not against the 0 lower bound.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:90%
But it was very slow to react.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.840 align:middle line:84%
They were in a situation
like in this diagram here.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But they kept the
interest rate high.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And they moved very slowly.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they tried to
catch up, well, they

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
went into deflationary
environment.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So the real interest rate
was moving away from them,

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.428 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that they were
moving the nominal interest

00:17:25.428 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
rate down.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And that you can see here.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Depression
starts around 1929.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:90%
It starts really in 1929.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Unemployment initially was low.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The nominal interest
rate was around 5%.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And inflation rate, growth
declined very rapidly.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:90%
The inflation rate was around 0.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
So you had a one year--

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the real interest rate
was around 5%, as well.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, things got worse.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment began to
climb very rapidly.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the Fed began to lower
interest rates, nominal interest

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Went from 5% to 4%.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Those were unusually low
interest rates for the time.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that the
inflation by then was -2.5%.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.987 align:middle line:84%
So the real interest
rate-- they were lowering

00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:90%
the nominal interest rate.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But the real interest
rate was rising.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And unemployment, accordingly,
was rising, as well.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:90%
It kept going.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Then they began to cut the
interest rate more aggressively.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But we got into real
deflation, -10% or so.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So the real interest
rate kept climbing.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
At that point was a very
poor time interest rate hike,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
was a disaster for
unemployment because it really

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
hiked the interest rate, real
interest rates even more.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And eventually got
out of it with a bunch

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of policies that were
non-monetary policies.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happened.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Depression
was very much

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
a story of this kind
in which essentially we

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
fell into depression so that
interest rate began to climb

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and got the economy deeper
and deeper into recession

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and unemployment higher
and higher and so on.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, monetary
policy just didn't work.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason you
have to essentially do

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
massive fiscal policy
to get out of it.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk about
some of the shocks

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
we have discussed in the context
of this more complete model now.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And actually-- OK, let me talk
about two canonical type shocks.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You can have two broad
type of shocks or policies

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
in these models that
you want to analyze.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are aggregate
demand, either policies

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:90%
or shocks or whatever.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Those are things that you know.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Aggregate demand policies
move the IS curve--

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
IS and LM, but moves
operates in the goods market.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is one case of a
contractionary fiscal policy,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:90%
a fiscal consolidation.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:90%
So what happens here?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you start an
equilibrium level of output

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
equal to the natural
rate of output.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But now, for whatever
reason, we're

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
running deficits
that are very large.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
You want to reduce the
size of the deficit.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, you move the
IS to the left.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you cut government
expenditure.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
You increase taxes.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
That will bring output below
the natural rate of output.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
Phillips curve here.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
That means inflation now, you
get into the deflationary forces

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.170 align:middle line:90%
or inflation starts declining.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:90%
The result of that--

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So in the short run,
you get exactly what

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
we had in lecture
five, six or whatever.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:84%
You get a contraction
in real output.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, you
start getting inflation

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
coming down, or
even going negative.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
the central bank will react.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And it will react.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And that reaction will
stop when in the long run

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
when output goes back to
the initial level of output,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:90%
its natural rate of output.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So the point of
this picture that

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is new relative to
things you already knew

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
is that in the short run,
you get very much the type

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:90%
of responses we had early on.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In the medium run, in the
medium run, you don't get that.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
A fiscal consolidation does not
reduce output in the medium run.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
The fiscal consolidation does is
reduces the real interest rate

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:90%
in the medium run.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So you see here,
output eventually

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
goes back to that level with a
much lower real interest rate.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The point is
sometimes this path,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
this path takes your output down
initially and then comes back,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:90%
can be very painful.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It can take a long time to
generate a procession and so on.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it can happen
in any sort of conditions

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and be faster and so on.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Many of the policies,
agreements that people have,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
people that understand
what they're talking about,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the speed at
which these things happen.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people
can agree that you

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:90%
need a fiscal consolidation.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But someone may think, no, this
stuff is going to be very slow.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.713 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't want to incur in
a very deep recession for very

00:22:00.713 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
long just to adjust a little
bit the fiscal deficit.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And others may
think the opposite.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly about the speed.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But shorter response to
a fiscal consolidation

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
or to any aggregate
demand contraction

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.523 align:middle line:84%
is different than the
medium term response.

00:22:15.523 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, the signals
for the central bank

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
move interest rate,

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
they all come from this block
here-- inflation falling.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
That tells the
central bank, oops,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
we may have a
problem, and so on.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of shock
that is more complicated

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and that has played
a role actually

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:84%
very much in the
recovery from COVID

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of
supply side shock--

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
for example, an oil shock.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The price of energy goes
up or something like that.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, that one, how
do you analyze that?

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
A supply side shock is not
something that comes from,

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that would go to the
IS-LM part of the model.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
A supply side
shock, remember, we

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
analyze it when we analyze the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's something that affects
the supply side of the economy.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We can model that as an
increase in the markup.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know that an
increase in the markup

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:84%
will increase the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
That means that this shock will
do what to potential output?

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So an energy shock, especially
if it's a persistent one,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
will operate like
a markup shock.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we know will
increase the natural rate

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to
the potential output?

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Goes down, of course.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.052 align:middle line:84%
Output is equal to
employment, to labor force

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
times 1 minus the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.843 align:middle line:84%
If the natural rate of
unemployment goes up,

00:23:50.843 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
then the potential
output goes down.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So that is not a shift
in the top diagram.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a shift in
the lower diagram.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It says, we used to have
this Phillips curve.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And now the Phillips curve
has shifted to the left.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.243 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a new
natural rate of an output.

00:24:07.243 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
natural rate of output

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is at that point when output
equal to the natural rate

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:84%
of output does not produce
inflationary forces.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
this shock here?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the economy was
in this equilibrium here

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and now it gets hit
by an oil shock.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:84%
In the short run,
if no one reacts,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
nothing happens to output.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't move much.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.725 align:middle line:90%
But what happens?

00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.240 align:middle line:84%
You see, if I don't
move something

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
in this part of the diagram, I'm
not moving equilibrium output.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
In the short run,
equilibrium output

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is determined exactly
in the same way

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:90%
we have determined up to now.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we get a markup shock,
nothing happens to output.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
If nobody moves, nothing happens
to output in the short run.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
that we may not like?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the
Phillips curve went up.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Before, that level of output
was consistent with no changes

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:90%
in inflation.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's not.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:90%
We get an increase in inflation.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first place where you'll
see the effect of the oil shock

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.617 align:middle line:90%
here is inflation will pick up.

00:25:28.617 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the price of gasoline
going up and all those things.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
you see it first.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Before activity falls,
you see it there.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes up
the Phillips curve also,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s and '80s.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see lots of
shocks of this kind.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Initially, unemployment
didn't move much,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:90%
but inflation kept climbing.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.252 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happens.

00:25:48.252 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
when that happens,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.593 align:middle line:84%
if it persists-- and
typically central banks,

00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
if they think is
very short lived,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.718 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to
react to this stuff.

00:25:54.718 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But if it is persistent and
they think it's persistent,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:90%
then the reaction is what?

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, they need to--

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
this only means that the
natural rate of interest

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
has gone up because I
need, for that same IS,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I need to bring down
equilibrium output.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
That means I need a higher
natural rate of interest rate,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.893 align:middle line:90%
or a higher R star.

00:26:17.893 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So what the Fed needs to do,
the central bank needs to do,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
is just start increasing
interest rates.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a natural response.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what happened
during the COVID,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
why inflation picked
up so much in COVID

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
is because we had a
shock of this kind.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It was not energy.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:90%
The energy shock came later.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was supply side,
transport costs, and stuff

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:84%
like that, the network, the
production network and things

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:90%
like that broke down.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But they thought it was
going to be very temporary.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So understanding this model,
they thought, OK, look, this,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
this curve will
come back by itself,

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:90%
so better not react right now.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Because a recession
is really, this curve

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
will come down,
back down by itself.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem is
that it didn't come back

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:90%
by itself that fast.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Some things came up fairly fast.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Some others did not.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
In particular, labor
force participation

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:84%
did not come
sufficiently fast back.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason
we stayed too long

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:90%
in a situation like this.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the main
reasons inflation sort crept up

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
in the US, and also in
other places in the world.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, the big reason for
why inflation picked up there

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
is because this
curve moved a lot up.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.941 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.941 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:90%
They had a massive energy shock.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that moved
that curve up a lot.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.235 align:middle line:84%
I want to now return to
what is going on right now.

00:27:55.235 --> 00:27:57.842 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Actually first, I'm going
to-- yeah, right now,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:90%
meaning the last few days.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
that this diagram

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that I used for the
fiscal consolidation shock

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
can also be used to
understand a little bit what

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:84%
happens with the Silicon
Valley Bank event.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we model
that as a credit shock.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We said that x we had
is like x going up.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, x going up
does exactly that.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It moves IS to the left.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So a shock to x, a panic of
the kind that we saw, is that.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It moves IS to the left.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So for any given level, the
safe, real interest rate,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
a panic, a shock to credit and
so on, moves the IS to the left.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.248 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:28:50.248 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.718 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.718 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So the safe interest
rate doesn't go up.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But what goes up is the cost
of borrowing because firms need

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:90%
to pay this extra risk premium.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And then for any given safe
interest rate, the real interest

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
rate, firms have
to pay more, which

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
means there is less
investment for any given level

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:90%
of the real interest rate.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And so the IS moves to the left.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And if that happens,
then you start

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.655 align:middle line:90%
getting deflationary forces.

00:29:22.655 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, all this
happens very quickly here.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.330 align:middle line:84%
In reality, I told you there
are lots of lags and so on.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.425 align:middle line:84%
But markets begin to
anticipate what will happen.

00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:90%
So markets begin to anticipate.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So in the immediate,
output doesn't collapse

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:90%
immediately or anything.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And inflation doesn't
collapse immediately.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But markets realized
that there are long lags.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:90%
But there is a shock already.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's likely that
these things will happen.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's likely that
this will happen.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's also likely that
the Fed will react to that.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:84%
What should be the
reaction of the Fed

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.446 align:middle line:84%
if this stuff gets
to be persistent?

00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
How do you get out
of a shock like that

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
if you really want
to go back there?

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
You cut interest rates.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the US, they
were hiking interest rates

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:84%
because we dealing
with high inflation.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
This tells you, well, you should
slow down the pace of hiking.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, they don't
do it immediately.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They meet next week.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But the markets don't
need to wait for the Fed.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:84%
They anticipate what
the Fed is likely to do

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and they start betting on that.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you
next a bunch of charts

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
that show you that
someone in the market

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.762 align:middle line:90%
understands these mechanics--

00:30:49.762 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people,
because the prices

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:90%
are moving exactly that way.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
This is something-- this is
the one year ahead inflation

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
expectation, as
traded in the market.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's called Inflation breakeven,
the one year inflation break.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So these things are
traded in the market.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can trade
expected inflation

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
all the maturities you want.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is what the market was
expecting before this shock.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
We're getting hotter
and hotter numbers.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So the economy was-- inflation,
expected inflation, as price

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in the market, was
climbing one year out.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And then the shock came.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And look what had happened
to expected inflation.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:90%
It collapsed.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, why is that?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, people thought this
shock, that leads to that.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what they thought.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:84%
This bounce was markets got
a little excited yesterday.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
risk on environment.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.935 align:middle line:84%
Today they lost all
that already for a shock

00:32:00.935 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
about in a few minutes.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, the point
I wanted to highlight

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is, again, expected
inflation was getting

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:90%
a little out of control.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And then this x shock
came, the panic shock,

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately
expected inflation

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
declined because people
anticipated something like this.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The market anticipates
something like that.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the market's
expected next hike.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So March 22nd, the Fed
will decide on the increase

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:90%
in interest rate.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Fed
had decided, as I

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:84%
said in the previous lecture, to
go for a path of 50 basis points

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
initially, very high.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But since a couple
of meetings ago,

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:84%
they decided to slow
down to 25 basis points,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
precisely because they want
to wait and see a bit what

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.902 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] do we have?

00:32:53.902 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
long variable lags.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.060 align:middle line:84%
They have increased
rates a lot and so on.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So they have gone
back to a pace of 25.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you see somewhere
here, in February 22,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
if you ask the market, what do
you think will be the next hike?

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:90%
There will be lots of answers--

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:90%
trades, and so on.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But when I say answers, I mean
what is price, what is traded,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:90%
these financial instruments.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The average answer
was 30 basis points.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.332 align:middle line:84%
30 basis point is that
most of the people

00:33:25.332 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
thought that they were going
to increase the interest

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.912 align:middle line:90%
rate by 25 basis points.

00:33:28.912 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
few guys out there

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that thought the Fed doesn't
increase the interest

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:90%
rate by 33 basis points.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
That's 25, 50, 75.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.768 align:middle line:84%
So this 30 meant that
almost everyone thought

00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%
it was going to be
25, but there were

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.643 align:middle line:84%
a few people that were concerned
that it could be higher

00:33:44.643 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:90%
What happened here?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We started getting very
hot numbers on inflation.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden the
equilibrium changed dramatically

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and we went to 45, which
means most people then

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
thought in the market that
the next hike on March 22

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:90%
was going to be 50 basis points.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And a few people
said stay at 25.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason this is 0.5.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But it was almost
priced in that.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:84%
When people say pricing,
they are talking about this.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
What is the hike
that's priced in?

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It's this statistic.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Look, that's what happened with
the Silicon Valley bank event,

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:90%
a collapse in this thing.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's trading at
around 13 basis points.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:36.070 align:middle line:84%
That means most of the people
think, the traders here think,

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.219 align:middle line:84%
that there will
be no hike at all.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So a few days ago,
they all thought

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be 50 basis
points, which is a big hike.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And now most people think there
will be no hike whatsoever.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But a few think that
it's going to be 25.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's almost 50/50.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I think today is a
little lower than that.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost 50/50
that it's 25 or 0.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
But had you asked
anyone around here,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and certainly around here,
is there any chance of 0,

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and there will be
no one, literally.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:90%
That contract was not traded.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:90%
OK well, you see things happen.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Accidents happen.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:90%
So now that's where we are at.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this all lasts a week
and everything gets resolved,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.420 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have a lot of
macroeconomic consequences.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.505 align:middle line:90%
It's just a little panic.

00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, some
people make money.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people lose
money, and so on.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But this can be a very
problematic shock, actually,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Because what you see
here, this is the size,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:90%
this is Silicon Valley Bank.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.180 align:middle line:84%
These are all the banks
smaller than that.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that all
this bank at this moment

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:84%
are reshuffling
their portfolios,

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:90%
are becoming very conservative.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want to
be exposed to similar risks.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.635 align:middle line:84%
They realize that
the environment

00:35:59.635 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:90%
became very unfriendly to--

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:84%
there can be ransomed
banks in any moment,

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that it's a
big policy package out there.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But people are still
withdrawing lots of deposits

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
from small banks, small
and regional banks.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And they all deposited it in JP
Morgan, you know, the big banks.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of deposits
that, despite the insurance,

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
the blanket insurance
that is implicit,

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
at least at the moment, lots
of deposits from these sectors

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:84%
are moving to these
major banks here.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That's called a
flight to quality.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem of that
for the economy as a whole

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is that small banks
and regional banks

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
play a huge role in lending.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I think a little more
than 50%, for example,

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of the commercial and industrial
loans are made by small banks.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.720 align:middle line:84%
80% of the mortgages are
given by a small bank.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So it has a big
potential consequence.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to say
is that x may stay high

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:90%
for quite a bit of time.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason,
there is anticipation

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
that this will have
macroeconomic consequences.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
that the Fed will react,

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.305 align:middle line:84%
that inflation will
change, and all that.

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.175 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we
were at on Monday.

00:37:20.175 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we
had the lecture,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you more
or less that the story.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You can read it there, but
it may not mean much to you.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm
highlighting is this.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty big.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
35% decline.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:90%
This is an equity.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a share.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the value of the
equity of a pretty major bank,

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Credit Suisse.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So Credit Suisse has been
in trouble for a while.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But today got into
really big trouble

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and saw a massive collapse
in the equity shares.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they stopped trading
for a while and so on.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:11.420 align:middle line:84%
This thing here-- you know, I
updated your slides many times

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.860 align:middle line:84%
today because I began to look
at this event around here.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing kept going
and they stopped, kept going,

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
where he's at now.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I stopped-- at what
time did I stop?

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:90%
9:00 in the morning.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was awake at 4:45 today.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So they tell you this
was pretty intense.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But what this is is the credit
default swaps on Credit Suisse.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Credit default swap is whenever
it's a bond issued by a bank,

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.820 align:middle line:84%
you can buy an
insurance on that bond.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So if the bond defaults on
you, you then use the insurance

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and you get paid.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So these things
for banks normally

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.842 align:middle line:84%
are very small numbers,
but for Credit Suisse,

00:38:55.842 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
bigger than for other
big banks because they've

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:84%
been in trouble for a
while, all sorts of trouble.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:90%
But look at that spike there.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's pretty big
for these kind of things.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not Lehman yet, but big.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.535 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that caused
a little panic today.

00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:19.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the stock prices
of the main European banks.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:90%
It's sold today.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.900 align:middle line:90%
So look at this.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a little rally
yesterday and so on.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the decline
as a result of the US problem,

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the Silicon Valley Bank's.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Then a rally yesterday.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And then Credit Suisse happened.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And you had a big decline in
all the major banks in Europe.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
The US banks are also declining.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But that was bigger
for the major banks.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
The Vix, remember I
told you last week,

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
last Monday, about
this indicator of

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.300 align:middle line:84%
fear in the market, which is
really the price of put options?

00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm simplifying things.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, protection for big
declines on the equity market.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, it began to spike very,
very sharply as a result.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
with the US event.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Then yesterday we got a
rally, risk on type thing.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then today we
got a new event.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I like this picture.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:90%
What this is.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what
the blue line is.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The blue line is the market
expected federal funds rate

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.480 align:middle line:84%
at different dates
in the future.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Today the federal funds
rate is around 4 and 1/2.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.535 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the market expects.

00:40:49.535 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So they expected the Fed to
continue to hike interest rates

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and to reach a peak around
in June 14 in that meeting

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:90%
of the order of 5.3% or so.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.375 align:middle line:90%
That's what's the average.

00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of dispersion.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That people are betting on
6%, but that's the average.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what people expected.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The yellow things is
the number of hikes

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that you're likely to see.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So you're likely to see one
hike in the next meeting,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:84%
another one in the next
meeting, and another one

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:90%
in the next meeting.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And then stop and begin
sort of cutting rates.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
That was expected
path on Friday--

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.197 align:middle line:90%
10th was Friday.

00:41:32.197 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:90%
More or less around there.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Thursday,
I don't remember.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that
was expected path.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So still, hike
rates reach a peak

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:84%
of 5.3% and still pretty
high interest rates

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.810 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the year.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.195 align:middle line:90%
That was expected path.

00:41:49.195 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it looks now.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Very different.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Now people are expecting very
small changes now, I showed you.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like 13 basis points
what people expect.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Still people expect sort
of a hike, but small one.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Now they expect the peak to be
sort of in May and then the Fed

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to start cutting
very aggressively

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.140 align:middle line:84%
to at the end of
the year, end up

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
with much lower
rates than today.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly what
I was telling you before.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The market is
anticipating that we

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
had a huge contraction in the
IS because x went up a lot.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
The major consequences, that
is going to be lower inflation.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have a problem.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if the US did not
have 5.5% of inflation today,

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that the Fed
would have come out and said,

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.230 align:middle line:90%
we cut the rates right now.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:84%
The only reason they're
not cutting right now

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:90%
is because we have two problems.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.298 align:middle line:84%
We have the financial
panic on one side

00:42:56.298 --> 00:42:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and we have the high
inflation on the other side.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So they have to balance
these two forces.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.655 align:middle line:84%
But the expectation
of the market

00:43:03.655 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is that the balance
of two forces

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.090 align:middle line:84%
is going to be dominated by the
contraction in aggregate demand

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
much sooner than
people were expecting.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the market
is pricing at the moment.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
is, I was trying

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to highlight that this is
very consistent with that.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just the market
looking ahead,

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:90%
but what is likely to happen.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It started from
a situation which

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.075 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit more
complicated, again, because we

00:43:32.075 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:90%
already had high inflation.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do not know, really.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is on one
hand, more complicated

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because we have a problem
of high inflation.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.897 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
having high inflation

00:43:45.897 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:84%
allows you to cut the real
interest rate much more

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:90%
aggressively.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you bring the
nominal interest rate to 0

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and you have
inflation of 5%, that

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:84%
allows you to cut the
real interest rate to -5%.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you start
with a situation

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:84%
where your inflation is 0,
you don't have any space

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.610 align:middle line:90%
to cut the real interest rate.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.377 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed can be
very aggressive here.

00:44:04.377 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason is not
being very, very aggressive--

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.085 align:middle line:84%
They were very aggressive in
terms of supporting deposits

00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But they can be very aggressive
in terms of interest rate cuts

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:90%
if the need arises.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully we won't.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
space because we're

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.150 align:middle line:84%
starting from a much
higher level of inflation.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:90%
That helps.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It hurts in the sense that
it will delay the reaction.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But it helps in the
sense that they have

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.245 align:middle line:90%
much more space for policy.

00:44:31.245 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.455 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:44:36.455 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:84%
This is just one
year interest rates.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
That reflects the
previous picture, as well.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:57.340 align:middle line:84%
One year out rates were over
5% a few days ago and now are

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.530 align:middle line:90%
in the low 4s.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And this picture I kept
updating, as you can see.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.335 align:middle line:90%
It was really dropping fast.

00:45:04.335 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:90%
That's a big change.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.195 align:middle line:84%
The one year rate, 60 basis
points, that's a big change.

00:45:12.195 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we're at.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And from the next lecture, I'm
going to start with growth.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.950 align:middle line:90%
But any questions about this?

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to start
growth now in four minutes.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But so the set of
topics we're going

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.310 align:middle line:84%
to discuss from the next
lecture are very different,

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:84%
subject to not having
any major events.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.590 align:middle line:84%
If there is a major event,
I'm going to reshuffle things

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:84%
so we can talk about financial
panics and things of that kind.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope that it can
stick to the program

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.020 align:middle line:90%
and do growth in the next week.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Have a good weekend.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:90%
