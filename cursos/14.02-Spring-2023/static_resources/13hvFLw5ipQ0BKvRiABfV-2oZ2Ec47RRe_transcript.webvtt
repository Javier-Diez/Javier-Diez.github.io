00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: So today
we're going to look at--

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start looking
into the labor market.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the labor market is very
interesting for a wide variety

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.405 align:middle line:84%
of reasons that we will
not discuss in this course,

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
about labor economics,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:90%
it's about macroeconomics.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But there are at
least two reasons

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
why labor markets are
very important in macro.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
One is because things
like unemployment rate

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:84%
is a very important indicator
of the macroeconomic health

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:90%
of a country or an economy.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And the second one, which is
quite relevant these days,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:90%
is that the inflation rate is--

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the main drivers
of the inflation rate

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is what is going on
in the labor market.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And we will try to
understand this mechanism

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of lectures.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But you have there is the
inflation rate in the US.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm showing you this
picture several times

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
after going through a long
period in which the inflation

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
rate hovered around
2% with cycles.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing an episode
of very high inflation.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Things are coming down.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But they are still at extremely
high levels, 6% or so.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And actually, very
recently these numbers

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
have picked up again a little.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that's very high
inflation rate-- way

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
too high for an economy like
the US to feel comfortable with.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And whenever some member of
the FOMC comes out and explains

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
why interest rates are
so high at this moment

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and explains why they are likely
to remain high for quite a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
while, they say, well, look,
inflation is uncomfortably

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
at high levels and labor market
conditions are very tight.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And that suggests that the
inflation problem is not

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
likely to go away
in the near future.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's something we need
to understand in macro.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
labor market being tight

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.113 align:middle line:84%
says anything about the
inflation rate, for example?

00:02:31.113 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind
of things that we're

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
going to discuss in particular
on the Monday lecture.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Now today we're going to start
with more basics of the labor

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
market and at the
same time, we're

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
going to begin a transition in
the course in which we have been

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.620 align:middle line:84%
focusing on things that
are in the very short run

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:90%
into things that take more time.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because many of the things that
we're going to discuss today

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
are things that you're
not likely to see

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
in every single quarter.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But there are things that
you're likely to see over

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
averages over several
quarters, several months.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to look at today.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- let me just
recap a little bit what

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
we have been doing up to now.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We have been looking
at this IS-LM

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
model, which is a great model.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a very good
model to build on.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very nice
model, starting point,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
happens during a recession

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and what are the likely impact
of the different macroeconomic

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
policies, monetary policy,
fiscal policy, and so on.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It is not such a great model
once the aggregate supply

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
side of the economy, something
we have completely ignored,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
starts becoming binding.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember that to now
in the IS-LM model

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
we had basically, as a model,
we had two assumptions,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:90%
related assumptions.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:90%
One, prices were fully sticky.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They didn't move at all.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Second, that output was
aggregate demand determined.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So whatever aggregate
demand wanted,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
producers found a way to
produce it at some given price.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
That combination is
unlikely to happen when,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
for example, when firms
are finding trouble

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:90%
finding new workers.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.467 align:middle line:84%
Because there may
be more demand,

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:90%
more demand for its goods.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But the firm may find it
hard to expand production.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is also highly likely
that in a situation like that,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
firms are going to want
to keep prices constant.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
At some point they
will, look, you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
have lots of meals
at my restaurant.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I cannot find people to
work at my restaurant.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll hide the prices so
at least fewer tables

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and I can manage one
way or the other.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start
building a model that

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
takes those things
into consideration,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
what is the impact
of a tight supply

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:90%
side of the economy on prices?

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And how that starts
affecting, feeds back

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
into equilibrium
output eventually.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the main thing
I would say we're

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
going to do, really, relative
to the model in the next two,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
three lectures is endogenize
the inflation rate.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
We have kept prices fixed.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:90%
But now we're on endogenize.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And the story of that
endogenization of inflation

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:90%
starts from the labor market.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.012 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why we're going

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to start looking at
the labor market today.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me remind
you a few things

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that I think we discussed
in the first lecture

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
or so or maybe second,
I don't remember.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.275 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a picture
of the labor market

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and some variables, important
statistics of the labor market,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that matter for understanding
inflation and so on.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is a picture
that's the one

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have in the
book of the labor market.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a picture of the labor
market at some point in 2018.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know when.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a picture at one point.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And that says that at that
time the US had about 330

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
million people, that the
noninstitutional civilian

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
That is, those people that
in principle could work,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
were about 260 million.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
That excludes people
under 16 years old,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
people that are
incarcerated, people

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
that are in the armed forces.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are excluded from--

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
that's the difference.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.938 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason you have such
a big gap between these two

00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of this people
that potentially could work,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:90%
some of them want to work.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the civilian labor force.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them are
out of the labor force--

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:90%
again, at one point in time.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that these
people are permanently out

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.622 align:middle line:90%
of the labor force.

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
They may be temporarily out
of the labor force, and so on.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But we started with
about 330 million.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And by the time that we look
at the people that really want

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to work at that point when
the picture was taken,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
was about half of that,
162 million people.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, these 162 million people,
the great majority of them

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
are typically employed.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:90%
They have a job.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
a group of people

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.678 align:middle line:90%
that would want to have a job--

00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that's the reason they are part
of the civilian labor force--

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:90%
but do not have one.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's about 6 million
in that picture there.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear the
unemployment or the unemployment

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
rate, you're really talking
about these people here.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear about
the unemployment rate

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
is these people not divided
over total population,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but is these people divided
by the civilian labor force.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's a picture.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The most recent numbers we have
about that kind of statistics

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:90%
is here you have them.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the unemployment rate
in the US today is about 3.4%.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:90%
That's very low.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you historical data
in a minute and a half shown

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
you historical data
in the recent past.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But this number
is very, very low.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
The change in the
unemployment level--

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:90%
this is for January--

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:90%
was a reduction.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:90%
This is not rate.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.393 align:middle line:84%
This is number of
people that were--

00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
it's not number of people
that were unemployed

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:90%
that are no longer so.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:84%
You look at the total stock of
unemployed in December and then

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
you look at the total stock
of unemployed in January 2023,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
these two is 28,000 workers.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So 28,000 less workers are
in the unemployment pool.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now notice that how
this number is made.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you 25,000,
28,000 people just gain a job.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's not what happened.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
What happens is first
employment, 895,000,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:90%
894,000 people got a job--

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:90%
much bigger number.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But also, the civilian labor
force went up by 866,000 people.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back
to this picture,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
what you have in January, or the
numbers reported in January--

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I do not know which month
they correspond to exactly--

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:90%
is that yes, this decline.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But that decline was made of
a big increase in employment

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
together with a big increase
in the civilian labor force.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So that must have been mostly
movement out of the labor force

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and probably had
something to do-- well,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get into that here.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But all these numbers
are seasonally adjusted.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So they are corrected relative
to what happens normally

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:90%
in January and so on.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.628 align:middle line:84%
And COVID and weather
can derail a lot

00:10:16.628 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
what happens in
January and February.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Numbers tend to be very noisy.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Since COVID they
have been very noisy

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
because the seasonal
adjustments are different.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And also, weather matters a
lot in January and February,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.007 align:middle line:84%
So you can get pretty
large fluctuations

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
which are really not that
interesting to macroeconomists.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, those
are the numbers.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You look at the civilian
labor force participation.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Then it was about 62%, 62.5%.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And the employment population
ratio is of the order of 60%.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So the employment
population ratio

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:84%
is just this divided
by total population.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And those are the averages.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The number of
unemployed in 2022,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:84%
about 6 million people
that's unemployed.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So there you have the
unemployment rate.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And it moves, as
you would expect it.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It typically goes
up in recessions.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The last sort of large
recession we had big swings.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
One thing that was interesting,
and we couldn't quite

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
understand what was going
on, is that we noticed right

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
before COVID the
unemployment rate had already

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
declined to very low levels.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And so people were
wondering whether something

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
was going to talk about
later in this lecture,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
whether the natural
rate of unemployment

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:90%
had changed for some reason.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll come back to that.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we got COVID, obviously
a very recessionary shock

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
initially, massive
unemployment and so on.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But then it came
back very quickly.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And today we have record
low levels of unemployment.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen numbers like
this since the '60s really--

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:90%
very low levels of unemployment.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
when you hear the FOMC

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
members talking about the
labor markets being very tight,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
well, one of the things
they're looking at is this one.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.827 align:middle line:84%
There are other statistics
that I'll show you.

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:90%
But this is one of them.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment rate is
really, really low.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, again, especially
post-COVID because of movements

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.020 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the labor
force, the unemployment rate

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is not such a great
statistic, not as reliable

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
because many people
left the labor force.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So people look a lot
at the employment rate.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This is not the employment
population ratio.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Its employment
rate-- so employed

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
over the non
civilian population.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And that number, you can see,
we have discussed this before,

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
was trending up here because
of the increase in the labor

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
participation of women,
then it came down,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:84%
had a lot to do with the
students and things like that,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:90%
systematically.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But then it was
climbing up enormously.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It collapsed during COVID.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:84%
That's mostly unemployment and
people out of the labor force.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:90%
And then recovery.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But the recovery has not
picked up to back to the trend.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So we are back to more or less
the levels we had before COVID,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.228 align:middle line:84%
but we're certainly
off the trend.

00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons the
labor markets are very tight

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is that we haven't
recovered the employment

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:90%
rate that we used to have.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with migration
flows, with a variety of things.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:90%
But that's the issue.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's sort of--

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
those are very static
pictures of the labor market.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the stock of
unemployment at one point?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
What is the unemployment
rate, and so on and so forth.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
that labor markets

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
are very dynamic, especially
in an economy like the US.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
The flows are very large.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I have there-- and
I don't know for which state

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
this is in the book-- but the
pictures look more or less

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the same for the
point I want to make.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
This is monthly labor flows.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
in some months--

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't care, 2018,
at some point.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at what happened there.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:90%
You have this.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the stocks recently.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So employment in that
month was of the order

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:90%
of 132 million people.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Out of the labor force,
about 79 million people.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.745 align:middle line:90%
Unemployed, about 8.6 million.

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Those are the stocks.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Those were the type of numbers
I was showing you before.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
But look at these arrows.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:90%
These are flows.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So in every single
month, you see in the US

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
about 3 million people that
move from one job to another.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:90%
So employment to employment.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You see about 1.8 million
that moved from employment

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to unemployment and
about 2 million people

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that move from unemployment
to employment, large flows.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Not only so, not everything goes
to unemployment to employment.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
There are people are also
moving out of the labor force

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and into the labor force into
an employment, into employment.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Here in this particular
case, out the flow,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
out of the labor force into
employment is 3.4 million.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Flows from employment, without
going through unemployment

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
without the labor
force, 3.7 million.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:84%
During COVID, this must have
been a very thick arrow,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
lots of people move out from
employment to out of the labor

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
the economy has

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
had in the recovery on
the labor market side

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
is that this arrow hasn't been
as strong as we would want it.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
This arrow or this arrow for
that matter of fact-- people

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the labor
force into unemployment.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:90%
That's also a big flow.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
are not working.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they decide they run
out of unemployment insurance

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they decide
to start looking.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And they move into unemployment
here, or they run out of savings

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:90%
and they have to come back.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And they may not
find a job initially.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They have to go
through unemployment.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So point is that these
flows are very large.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And these flows matter
a lot for the kind

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of things we want to talk
about in this course.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at what we have here.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The red line is the
unemployment rate

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's measured
on the left axis.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
here in the blue line

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:90%
is measured in an inverse scale.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Look at this-- this
goes up as you go down--

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:46.365 align:middle line:84%
is the percentage of unemployed
workers becoming employed.

00:16:46.365 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's the job finding
rate from unemployment.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:90%
So you have unemployed people.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.217 align:middle line:90%
And they will be finding jobs.

00:16:55.217 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:90%
They are looking for jobs.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:90%
And they will be finding jobs.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
This number here, this blue line
here, shows you the likelihood

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that they'll find a
job in inverted scale.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what correlation
do you notice there?

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
it's very tight.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: There's
a percent of people

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that get a job each
month is smaller,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.995 align:middle line:84%
there's more people
without a job.

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
That means when the
unemployment rate is high,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
it is harder for unemployed
workers to find a job.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of a
direct implication

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
of that is the typical
unemployed worker

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.707 align:middle line:84%
will spend more time
in unemployment,

00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because they're going
to be looking for jobs

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.513 align:middle line:90%
and it's harder to get a job.

00:17:47.513 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be looking
for a job for a longer

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Why are we talking
about these things?

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of
these type of reasons.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, this means that
when unemployment is high,

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.648 align:middle line:84%
workers are worse off
in at least two ways.

00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
ways that are going

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to be important for
what I'll say next.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.627 align:middle line:84%
One is that the employed
workers face a higher

00:18:11.627 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:90%
probability of losing job.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.793 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
unemployment-- the reason

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
unemployment gets to be high
is because firms are firing

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:90%
workers and so on and so forth.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when
unemployment is high,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
the workers know is

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that it's very likely that
they'll lose their job,

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
more likely that
they'll lose their job.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But the second channel, which
is what this picture highlights

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
here, is that if you
fall unemployment,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a lot harder
to get out of unemployment.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So when unemployment
is high, it's

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
scary for workers
for two reasons.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
One, you're more likely to
lose a job because you're

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
capturing recessionary
conditions and so

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%
on in the economy.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But second, if you end
up in unemployment,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
hard to get out of it

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And later on, this
unemployment rate

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to show up
in wage bargaining.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason is going
to show up is of this kind.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.932 align:middle line:84%
And also think about
the other side.

00:19:11.932 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
When there's bargaining,
there's two in a bargaining.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
firm and workers.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
From the firm point of view if
there's a lot of unemployment,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
do you think it's hard
or easy to find a worker,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to replace a worker that decides
to leave for whatever reason?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.787 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:30.787 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of
people to choose from.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes easy.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So unemployment is high,
workers are more scared.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
If they get out, they're
scared of losing the job.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:84%
If they get out, it's
hard to get a job.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
the firms, for the firms,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not that scary to lose
a worker because it's fairly

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:90%
easy to replace that worker.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Today, firms are very worried
about losing their workers

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:90%
in some sectors.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:84%
In some sectors are
getting rid of workers.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you run a
restaurant, you're

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.572 align:middle line:84%
very scared of
losing your workers

00:20:05.572 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to be
very difficult to find

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:90%
a replacement for that worker.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Surprise, surprise,
wages in that industry

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:90%
are going up a lot.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get there.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's what comes
next-- wage determination.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at what I'm
trying to build here.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting from
telling you stories

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
about the labor market, what
things are important for workers

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to get
into wage determination.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And obviously the
variables I talked

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:84%
about are going to be important
in this way determination.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But my ultimate goal is
to talk about inflation.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:90%
So the next step--

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to talk about
wage determination here.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to
talk about prices.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And there we're going
to be one step closer

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to talking about inflation

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go through
the intermediate step, wage

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:90%
determination.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so just to give you
a little background,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes wages are set by
collective bargaining, unions,

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.343 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the US unions
are not a big thing.

00:21:08.343 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
They were a much
bigger thing many years

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:90%
back than they are today.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:84%
In other economies
they are a big thing--

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Japan and Europe.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And the unions can happen at
different levels of aggregation,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the firm,
at the level of the sector,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and you name it.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
In general, regardless of
the level of unionization

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
you have in a country
or in a sector,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the higher the skill needed
to do a job, the more likely

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it is that bargaining takes
place between an individual,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
between an employer, and an
individual, rather than a union,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's sort of much more
idiosyncratic and customized

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But either way, regardless
of whether wages

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:84%
are set at a collective level
or at an individual level,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
the main macroeconomic
drivers of wages

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.692 align:middle line:90%
are similar across both of them.

00:22:09.692 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the particulars
are going to be different.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Even the dynamics can
be different and so on.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But the big drivers,
the big macro drivers,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
are similar, regardless
of the bargaining

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.793 align:middle line:84%
mode you have at the level
which happens, and so on.

00:22:22.793 --> 00:22:25.085 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things
we're going to highlight here.

00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So a fact of life is that
workers' wages typically

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%
exceed the reservation wage.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does it mean
the reservation wage?

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.972 align:middle line:84%
The reservation
wage is a wage that

00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
would leave you indifferent
between employed or unemployed.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean, it's a
nice wage or anything.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.082 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.082 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And certainly it doesn't
mean that you wouldn't

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:90%
prefer to have a higher wage.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But it tells you that, look,
at that wage you'd rather

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:90%
be employed than unemployed.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way,
long list of reasons

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.585 align:middle line:84%
why that ends up being
the equilibrium type wage.

00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
discuss them here.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:90%
But take it as a fact for now.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So workers preferred
to be employed.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They may take the risk
of becoming unemployed.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But they typically
prefer to be employed.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And now wages-- and this is
where it becomes important,

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:90%
interesting for us in macro--

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
is the wages that
are finally set

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
depend on labor
market conditions.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So very clearly, the lowest
unemployment rate, the higher

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:90%
the wages will tend to be.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.493 align:middle line:90%
And you're seeing it now.

00:23:42.493 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
The unemployment
rate is very low.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Wages are rising a lot.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And workers' bargaining
power depends,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
again, there's a huge
literature on these things

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and just compressing it
into the bare minimum.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And the bargaining
power of our workers

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
are things that we
already discuss.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends on
how costly for the firm

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:90%
to find the workers.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, if
unemployment is very high,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy for
firms to find a worker.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
That's not good for the
bargaining of a worker.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want to bargain
with your employer

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.045 align:middle line:84%
and there lots of people
like you out there,

00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to have
a lot of bargaining power.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.045 align:middle line:84%
So it's unlikely that
you're going to come up

00:24:21.045 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:90%
with a very high wage.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, the
other side of it

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is how hard is for workers
to find another job if they

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:90%
were to leave the firms.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you know that there
are lots of jobs like the one

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:84%
you currently have out there,
which are not occupied--

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.017 align:middle line:90%
so there's empty, vacant, jobs--

00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
then you probably are going
to have a much stronger hand

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
with your employer
because you can say, OK,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:84%
if you don't pay me what I
want, I move to the next door.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
macroeconomic variables

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
we care about, a
situation like that

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is very likely to
happen when unemployment

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
is very low because that
means that other jobs are

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.827 align:middle line:84%
unlikely to be filled because
there are lots of people looking

00:25:00.827 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
for things, but it's
difficult for the firms

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:90%
to find the workers.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you're going
to be a lot more attractive

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:90%
to that labor market.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, at
the aggregate level,

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
we can write a wage setting
equation of this form.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So the wage-- and this
is a nominal wage--

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
can be written as an increasing
function of the expected price,

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
meaning wages are not
set, in most professions,

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
they are not set
second by second.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You bargain for
a wage and so on.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And that thing sticks for
a year or so at least.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously if you
expect, if inflation is zero,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
you're going to demand a wage
that is more or less what

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:90%
you need today.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
If inflation is 10%,
you say, well, I'm

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
going to have to demand a
higher wage because I have

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to live with this
wage for a year

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and prices are going to be
rising when I have this wage.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So if they expect
lots of inflation,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
if I expect prices to
be high in the future,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to ask
for a higher nominal wage

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
today because I'm
going to have to live

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
with that wage on average
for the next year or so.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.072 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing, and it's

00:26:22.072 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
going to play an
important role, is

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that wages are an increasing
function on the price level

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
workers expect.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
They expect a higher
price level in the future

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
or during the life
of the wage contract,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:84%
then they obviously are going
to demand a higher wage,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:90%
other things equal.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:90%
What are other things?

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the arguments of
this function here--

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:90%
unemployment.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:84%
For any given expected price, if
the unemployment rate is high,

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
workers are going to
demand a lower wage.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because it's going to
be harder for them to find a job

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.788 align:middle line:84%
so they have less
bargaining power.

00:27:01.788 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: And they have
less bargaining power, exactly.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going
to demand a lower wage.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:84%
This variable, z, here is a
catch all variable for strength,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
workers' strength in the
bargaining position situation,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this is things
like employment protection

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%
laws, firing costs.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
If it's difficult
to fire someone,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the z will tend to be high.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So this only tells you that
given the level of unemployment,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
if it is very hard
to fire someone,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
workers are going to be very
likely to demand a higher wage.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:90%
It's hard for you to fire me.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bargain
hard for my wage.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And these type of
institutional factors

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.785 align:middle line:84%
play a huge role in Europe,
much more than in the US.

00:27:58.785 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of
definition, we're

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
going to say an
increase in z, z is

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:84%
something that increases the
bargaining power of workers.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, for
any given level

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment and
expected prices,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
they're going to lead
to a higher wage demand.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the workers'
demand in a wage.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We have to figure out what
happens in equilibrium.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is what the
workers are demanding.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it clear what we have here?

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's now move
to the other side.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's one side
of the scissor.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:90%
We have the workers.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And they given certain
macroeconomic conditions

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
summarized by the unemployment
rate and expected prices.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:90%
They demand certain wages.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can find
the equilibrium wage

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
until we don't see the
other side, what firms

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:90%
are willing to pay and so on.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So we need to explore
this other side.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And the starting point
of that other side

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
is the production
function, meaning firms

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to end up
setting prices for goods.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But producing those goods will
take factors of production.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to use
something to produce that.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And the cost of that something
will determine, importantly,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
what is the price
they end up charging.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to simplify
things a lot here.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume the
production function is

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:84%
first linear and linear only
on labels, so no other factors

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:90%
of production.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Meaning this says
that to produce

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:84%
one unit of the aggregate
good, you need--

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
well, this says that if
you add an extra worker

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
to the big production
function of the economy, then

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get A
more units of output.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what this says.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So Y is output, the output
we've been talking about,

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
measuring the way we have
been talking about, and so on.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:90%
N is employment.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And A is labor productivity.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.513 align:middle line:90%
That is the output per worker.

00:30:07.513 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to make
things very simple.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a lot about
in the next part of the course

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and the part of growth
about this A, what

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:84%
moves this A over time,
what it does, and so on.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to simplify
things a lot here for now.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
set A equal to 1.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.158 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't get
any simpler than this

00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
as a production function.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This production
function says you

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.090 align:middle line:84%
want to produce one more good,
you need one more worker.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:90%
This is what this says.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
If you have 10 workers, you
produce 10 units of good.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If you have 11 workers, you
produce 11 units of goods.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:46.245 align:middle line:84%
To produce one more unit of
good, you need one worker more.

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you think I'm
simplifying it so much

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm even repeating this idea
that one more worker one more

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:90%
unit of good?

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
That tells you that how much
does it cost to the firm,

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to the firm that has
this production function,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to produce one extra
unit of workers, of one

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.522 align:middle line:90%
extra unit of goods.

00:31:14.522 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to ask
the question, well,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:90%
what will the firm have to do?

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first--
so suppose a firm

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
wants to produce one
more unit of goods.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.382 align:middle line:90%
What is it that it needs to do?

00:31:25.382 --> 00:31:26.632 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Hire another worker.

00:31:26.632 --> 00:31:28.757 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: It needs
to hire another worker.

00:31:28.757 --> 00:31:30.065 align:middle line:90%
How much will that cost?

00:31:30.065 --> 00:31:36.578 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: The wage.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: The wage.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So now we're beginning
to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
wage, in this case

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:84%
is the cost per unit of
production for this guy.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So the marginal cost of
production for this firm

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:90%
is the wage.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:84%
All the rest, intermediate
inputs, is all summarized.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
This value added is
built on something else.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So this production function,
as simple as it is,

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
says exactly that.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The marginal cost of production
is equal to the wage.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to come up with
a pricing model, a price setting

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:90%
rules.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Firms that understand
how much more it

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
costs to produce an
extra unit of good

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
now have to decide
the price they

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:84%
want to charge for that
extra unit of the good.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot that
comes into that decision.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to summarize
it with a markup, very simple.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, look, the
firm will do the following.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll say, it
costs me one worker

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to produce one unit
of extra of good.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
A worker costs me
W. So the price

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to charge is 1 plus is M.
M is a positive number times W.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:90%
So M is a number like 0.2.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:90%
So you pay 100 in the wage.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Then you're going to charge--

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and suppose the wage is 100.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:84%
If the markup is 20%, you're
going to set a price of $120.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the price setting rule
that we're going to adopt.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's not that crazy.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Simple, but not that crazy.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So thus, we call this the
price setting equation.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The firm takes the
wage because that's

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
the marginal cost of production
and then adds a markup.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the final price.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can rewrite this
price setting equation

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
as a wage equation in
the following sense.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's still a price
setting equation.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But all that I've done here is I
divided by P, by P and 1 plus M.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I get that the
wage, the real wage

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the firm is willing to
pay, is equal to 1 over 1

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:90%
plus the market.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:90%
That's another way of saying it.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I took this price
setting equation.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And I just rewrote it.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I rewrote it this
way because then when

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I look at the wage
setting equation,

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I also wrote it that
way, W over something.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to write the
price setting equation

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.740 align:middle line:84%
in the same sort of units
as my wage setting equation

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
so then I can use one diagram,
put them together easily,

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and find an equilibrium
of something.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So what you see here is, for
example is that the higher is

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the markup, the lower
is the real wage

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.800 align:middle line:90%
the firm is willing to offer.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.863 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:34:26.863 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is an equilibrium at
the level of the economists,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:90%
not you individually.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But on average, that's
what ends up happening.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:84%
Firms, on average, end up
charging a higher markup.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the case that
in equilibrium the real wage

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:90%
offer by the firms is lower.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in a situation
where the markup was 0

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.179 align:middle line:84%
and now all of a sudden
because of imperfect

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
competition or perhaps some
price of a key input went up

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's not well measured
in value added or whatever,

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:84%
if the market goes to 1, then
the real wage in equilibrium

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
will fall to half
what it used to be.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
firms will offer.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an equilibrium
or not, we shall see.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Or how do we get that
to be an equilibrium?

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.498 align:middle line:90%
We shall see.

00:35:18.498 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
firms will offer.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what the price
setting equation says.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.902 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you already
know from this equation

00:35:24.902 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
the real wage will

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.322 align:middle line:84%
be because there is no variable
here that can adjust to that.

00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
something else will

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:90%
have to give in the economy.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So this ends up being
the equilibrium wage.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But you'll understand
that a little later,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
or you'll understand it
better a little later.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're almost
ready to come up with--

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to discuss a very important
concept in macroeconomics.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the concept of the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first
warning is that there

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is nothing natural about the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:07.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that God
gave us or anything like that.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll say for us, and
what typically means

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the natural rate
of unemployment,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
simply means what I wrote there,
which is the unemployment that

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:84%
takes place when the expected
price is equal to actual prices.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what we'll define for
this class, for this course,

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
we'll define the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.270 align:middle line:84%
The natural rate
of unemployment is

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
when the expected price is
equal to P. That's what we mean.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.610 align:middle line:84%
If we ask you any question about
the natural rate employment,

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:84%
we don't mean that
that's what is good,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that that's what is bad,
that that's what God decided

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:90%
or someone else decided.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
This is all that it means,
is that in any equation where

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
you have P, you can stick in P
and then solve for equilibrium.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And the unemployment
rate that comes from that

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, you can also
think of that unemployment rate

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
as a good proxy for
what is likely to be

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
the average rate of unemployment
of an economy over a longer

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
unlikely to be fooled

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.640 align:middle line:84%
all the time in
the same direction.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they're
going to expect

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.342 align:middle line:84%
a higher price [INAUDIBLE],,
sometimes it's lower, and so on.

00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:25.650 align:middle line:84%
On average, unless there is
something very weird going on,

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.573 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get
right, because you

00:37:27.573 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:84%
know more or less what the level
of inflation of the economy is.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you miss up.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you miss down.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But on average, you're
going to be right

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:84%
if you take an average
over a long period of time.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So for that reason, you can
also interpret this natural rate

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment as
the unemployment

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.387 align:middle line:84%
rate of the medium
run, if you will--

00:37:43.387 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:84%
so when you have
collected enough data

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.652 align:middle line:84%
and positive errors are balanced
with negative errors, and so on.

00:37:49.652 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But that's all that we
mean by the natural rate

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, notice that with
this assumption, that Pe

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is equal to P. I can go back to
my wage setting equation, which

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:90%
was W over Pe equal to F that.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what I had
divided by P. But I had P there.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I divide by
P both sides, and then

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to set Pe
equal to P. And now

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I have that my wage
setting equation

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
can be written this way.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And notice that the
unemployment rate I put here

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is N. It's a natural
rate of unemployment.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because once I have a
model in which I assume

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that Pe is equal to P,
the unemployment rate

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of that is a
natural rate of unemployment.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all that it just means.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
It says OK, you allow me
to replace Pe by P, well,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.250 align:middle line:84%
then I can call my unemployment
rate here the natural rate

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.549 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:38:42.549 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And it has lots of names--

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
natural rate, structural rate
of unemployment, and so on.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Now what this tells you--

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can see the
slope of this function.

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:84%
If the natural rate
of unemployment

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is higher in this
economy, what is

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:84%
the real wage that comes from
the wage setting equation?

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Lower.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a downward sloping curve in
the space of wages to real wages

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:90%
to unemployment.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So the natural rate
of unemployment

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
is a downward sloping
curve for the reasons

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:84%
we discussed before--
bargaining power and so on.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I can put together--
remember, the price setting

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.620 align:middle line:84%
equation led me to
also an equation

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.468 align:middle line:84%
the real wage, which was
not a function of anything.

00:39:31.468 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It was only a function
of parameters.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's a horizontal curve
in the space of real wages

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and unemployment, natural
rate of unemployment.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a
downward sloping curve.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And the intersection
of these two curves

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
is the natural rate
of unemployment.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So this was the price
setting relation.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's 1 over 1 plus
M. This is the wage setting

00:39:53.640 --> 00:40:00.610 align:middle line:84%
equation with the assumption
that Pe is equal to P.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.243 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:40:04.243 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And here you can
understand what I

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:84%
said before is that you see,
in this economy, the real wage,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:84%
because this price
setting equation is flat

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
in this simple economy, the real
wage is pinned down by the firm,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:90%
by the firms collectively--

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:24.425 align:middle line:84%
and not collectively in
an oligopsonistic way.

00:40:24.425 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
in equilibrium.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But the equilibrium
unemployment,

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:84%
natural rate of
unemployment, is intersection

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of the real wage set by the
firms and the wage setting

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to a
point, say to the right?

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
What happens in this point here?

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:90%
What is the situation we have?

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that high
level of unemployment,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.933 align:middle line:84%
workers are willing to work
for much lower real wages

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:90%
than the firms are offering.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what workers, at
this level of unemployment,

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
very high level of unemployment,
workers would be fine with this.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Firms are paying that.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So unemployment is
very likely to be

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
falling because workers
are not demanding a lot

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and firms are going to
hire all these workers.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:90%
The opposite here.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:84%
If here, workers are
demanding a wage that

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.440 align:middle line:84%
is much higher than
firms are willing to pay,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.240 align:middle line:84%
that's likely to lead
to more unemployment

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.300 align:middle line:84%
because firms are going to
be very reluctant to hire

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:90%
these very expensive workers.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
unemployment in this direction.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, nothing natural
about it is the equilibrium

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.880 align:middle line:84%
when you assume the expected
price is equal to price.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So there are some important
parameters in this diagram here.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.290 align:middle line:90%
One is this M, the market.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a parameter, very
important markup here.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
See, if the markup changes, the
natural rate of unemployment

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:90%
will change.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.170 align:middle line:84%
There's another set of
parameter here, which is z.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We took as given
the institutions

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that protect the bargaining
power of workers institutions,

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:90%
supporting institutions, the z.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a parameter here.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If that changes, the
natural rate of unemployment

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:84%
will change, which
is, again, something

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that confirms that
there is nothing

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:84%
natural about the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So let me just do it in
equations very quickly

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll do a couple
of important shifts.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of equation,
all that I did is says,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
look, the wage setting equation,
the price setting equation

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:90%
gives us that.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The wage setting
equation gives us that.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, that equal to
that, that's a point we found.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
rate of unemployment

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So from here, that's
when the two are equal.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:90%
This was the flat curve.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.160 align:middle line:84%
This was the downward
sloping curve.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, these two are equal when
these two things are equal.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you get there.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So from there you solve the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happens to
the natural rate of unemployment

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:90%
is z goes up.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's just be very mechanic
at this point, just math.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.760 align:middle line:84%
If z goes up, watch
what happens to F?

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Goes up if z was positive.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, the right hand
side hasn't gone up.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So this went up.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Something has to give,
so F comes back down.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that
can give, the only thing

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that's endogenous
in that picture

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:55.930 align:middle line:84%
there is a natural
rate of unemployment.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So if z goes up, F goes up.

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I need to bring F back
down because the right hand

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:90%
side hasn't given an inch.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So what do I have to do to a
natural rate of unemployment

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.090 align:middle line:90%
for F to come back down?

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Rise-- because that's what
will weaken bargaining power.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Workers' bargaining power got
stronger because increasing z.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have to weaken it some--

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Equilibrium will
weaken it somehow

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we end up in
the same situation,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.540 align:middle line:84%
with the same real wage
that we had before, which

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.930 align:middle line:90%
was equal to 1 over 1 plus m.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:90%
What happens if m goes up?

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if m goes up, markups go
up, that means firms real wage--

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the real way to
firms offers drops.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So if this right
hand side drops,

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:84%
then I need the left hand
side to drop, as well.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that is endogenous here

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.860 align:middle line:84%
is the natural rate
of unemployment.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I need to drop
F, what do I need to do to?

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:90%
So I need to bring F down.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And the only tool you
have is not a tool,

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:09.100 align:middle line:84%
but in equilibrium anything
that will can change here is uN.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It will increase uN
because that will

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.940 align:middle line:84%
reduce bargaining
power of workers

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and that will reduce
the real wage demand.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you restore
equilibrium that way.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So this environment is
a very nasty environment

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:84%
for workers in a sense
because it's always

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the escape value is the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So here you have what I
just said in pictures.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's example of z
going up, bargaining power

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:90%
of workers going up.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you start at
an equilibrium like this.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And now z goes up.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means that
workers, for any given

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.930 align:middle line:84%
level of unemployment,
natural rate of unemployment,

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:55.010 align:middle line:84%
want a higher wage because they
have more bargaining power.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that higher wage is
inconsistent with the wage

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.130 align:middle line:90%
that firms want to pay.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.350 align:middle line:84%
What restores equilibrium
is unemployment,

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:06.480 align:middle line:84%
the natural rate of
unemployment goes up enough so

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that the wage demand sort comes
down to the same original level

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:84%
because this price setting
equation is completely flat.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So there you have
a situation where

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.490 align:middle line:84%
bargaining power of workers went
up and all that end up happening

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is that, in the
medium run, at least,

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that the natural rate
of unemployment went up.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
That's very much the story
of Europe, by the way,

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.180 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s--

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:90%
France in particular.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
France had major labor reforms,
z boosting, if you will,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:90%
in the 1980.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Initially it was a
great deal for workers.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Real wages went up and so on.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But eventually with
the passage of time,

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
they ended up just with
a much higher real--

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:84%
not a much higher real wage, but
a much higher real unemployment

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.970 align:middle line:84%
That went from single
digit, low single digits,

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to 15% unemployment rates
and things like that.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And since then, they have been
sort of reforming the labor

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:90%
market to fix some of that.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But that was very much what
happened in continental Europe

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the case of
a markup increase,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.350 align:middle line:90%
the other one I described.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So if markups go up, then that
means firms in equilibrium

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.650 align:middle line:84%
are not willing
to pay real wages.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
They want to pay
a lower real wage.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this level
of unemployment,

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.247 align:middle line:84%
workers are not
going to take it.

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
will restore equilibrium

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.747 align:middle line:84%
is that the natural
rate of unemployment

00:47:33.747 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
goes up that weakens
the hand of workers.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And you end up with this.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, there is
nothing natural about this.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this
is good or bad.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why
the markets went up.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It is just imperfect
competition, going up,

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.570 align:middle line:90%
that's clearly not a good thing.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But it may have been something
else-- the price of oil

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:90%
went up a lot, I don't know.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a war somewhere and
then productivity came down,

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.400 align:middle line:90%
something of that kind.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.197 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what it did.

00:48:00.197 --> 00:48:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing
I'm describing here

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.620 align:middle line:90%
is the mechanics.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So the quiz is up to here.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:90%
So the quiz ends here.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.400 align:middle line:84%
In the next lecture, we're
going to start the Phillips

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.160 align:middle line:84%
curve, which is now
using this model,

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.990 align:middle line:84%
but looking at
deviations situations

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.900 align:middle line:84%
where the price is not equal to
expected price, or the expected

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:84%
price is not equal
to the actual price.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.685 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to lead
to interesting situations.

00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to be
talking about inflation.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.238 align:middle line:84%
Here, this is not a model
to talk about inflation.

00:48:38.238 --> 00:48:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about what
happens in the medium run.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I haven't told you whether
the adjustment happens

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
through the nominal wage,
through the prices, or what.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are many ways of
reaching the same real wage.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
You could have it--
you could lower

00:48:53.780 --> 00:49:00.620 align:middle line:84%
real wages by increasing wages
by 50% and prices by 60, say.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you could do it by
lowering nominal wages by 10

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and not moving prices.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:07.128 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ways of doing it.

00:49:07.128 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The Phillips curve is going to
allow us to get into that part.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be part of your quiz.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:84%
The quiz, that's going to
be part of the second quiz.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So in the next
lecture, I'm going

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.837 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the Phillips curve
and then on Wednesday a review.

00:49:18.837 --> 00:49:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And then you have your quiz.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:34.000 align:middle line:90%
