00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT CABALLERO:
OK, let's start.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to talk
about technological progress

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and economic growth.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big topic,
certainly, at MIT.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is one
of the main ways we

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:90%
contribute to human well-being.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But before I do that,
let me do a brief review

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
of the things I did
in the second half

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
of the previous lecture.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
For two reasons, I want
to do that brief review.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
First, after spring
break, so I assume

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
there is some depreciation of
knowledge since the last time.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And the second is that while
the equations I showed you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
at the end with population
growth are correct,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I think I said something
which is not correct.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.092 align:middle line:90%
I think I kept saying--

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But I kept saying,
look, if x is small,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
1 over 1 plus x is
approximately equal to minus x.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
No, it's approximately equal
to 1 minus x not minus x.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
correct that typo.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So let me remind
you what we had.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So we started with a
production function.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
One important part
of economic growth

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to have
capital accumulation will be

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a very important variable here.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we haven't talked about
capital in the production

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
function in the previous
part of the course.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.752 align:middle line:84%
But now we were
explicit about it.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And we started with
a production function

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that had constant returns to
scale on capital and labor.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And here, remember in
this part of the course,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about
unemployment or anything

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I say labor,
I also mean population.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean labor force,
all of them together.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
You know the distinction
between each of these concepts,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're not that
important for growth matters.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Mostly because all
of those aggregates

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
move in tandem
over the long run.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for a
population and the labor force

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to diverge for a very
long period of time.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe fluctuations and so on,
but then tend to move together.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So but we decided that we wanted
to look at things normalized

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
by population.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And so output per person
is an increasing function

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
of capital per person
but also is increasing

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:90%
at a decreasing rate.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
There is decreasing
returns with respect

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to the capital labor ratio.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so output per capita
grows as the economy becomes

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
more capital
intensive, that is you

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
have more capital
per worker, but it

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
grows at a decreasing rate.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The second key
equation of our model

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
was that we're saying
this part of the course,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to assume
that the government is not

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
running any fiscal deficit
or anything like that,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and the economy is
closed, which is

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.725 align:middle line:84%
an assumption we have
maintained and we

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
will keep assuming until
three lectures from now.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And so in closed economy,
no fiscal deficit.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We have that investment
is equal to saving.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And we made an
extra step to assume

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that the saving is proportional
to income, so S proportional

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:90%
to income.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So with all these
things together,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
putting these two
things together,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
we got to a very important
equation in any growth model,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
which is the capital
accumulation equation.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And this equation says, well,
the capital stock tomorrow--

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow means in the
next unit time, next year,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or whatever --is equal to
the current stock of capital

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
minus the depreciation
of that stock of capital

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
minus the delta times
kt plus investment.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But investment is
equal to saving,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and saving is proportional
to output, OK.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So that was common
across all the things we

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:90%
did in the previous lectures.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Is there any question
about these equations?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
No, no, good.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the next
step was to say, OK,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and I did remember all
the initial derivations.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that n was constant,
population was constant.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the next step was I
divided by a constant here.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So we did everything in terms
of capital output per person.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But actually, since
population was constant,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
the per person part
was just trivial.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:90%
We just divided by a constant.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I did, though,
in the previous lecture,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
was to say, OK, what
if that's not the case?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
What if population is
growing over time as well?

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:90%
How does our analysis change?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I did this.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, I said, well, OK, let's
start by dividing everything

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%
by nt plus 1.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So then we get capital
per person at t plus 1.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, I said is when
I divide the right hand

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
side by nt plus 1, I
don't get what I want.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I want capital T divided
by population of t.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I want output of t divided
by population at t, not

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
at t plus 1.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I multiply
and divide by nt both of these.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So I multiply by 1
and t over nt is 1,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
so I multiply by 1 everything.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And then rearrange terms, so
I got expressions like this.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I got what I wanted here,
which is capital per person

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:90%
at the same point in time.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But now it's multiplied
by nt over nt plus 1, OK.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same I can do
for this expression here.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
OK so this is what I'm using
the approximation here,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:90%
in which x is equal to gn.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
This thing here, is
just 1 over 1 plus gn.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this is
approximately equal.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I can approximate-- if
gn is a small number,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
this is approximately
equal to 1 minus gn.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we have.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
second approximation

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
going from this
line to this line

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%
in which we did the following.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We said, OK, this is equal to 1
minus delta minus gn plus delta

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:90%
times gn.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But the delta time gn
is the multiplication

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of two small numbers.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So I said assume that
it's close to zero.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And the same we have here.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We have saving rate
times 1 plus gn.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
You get you get the saving rate
plus the saving rate times gn.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But the saving rate times
gn is also small number,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.050 align:middle line:90%
so we also drop, OK.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.367 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
more explicit steps

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
of what I did in the
previous lecture.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think the final equation
I showed you was this,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
but it comes from, again,
two approximations.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The one down here,
which I use here.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the fact that I dropped
the second order terms, OK.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
rearrange things.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I move kt over n to
the left-hand side.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the change in
the stock of capital per person

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing
function of investment

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
per person, which
is this because this

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:90%
is saving per person.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And I can replace this by
the production function,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:90%
which is f of k over n.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what I have here
is a difference equation

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:90%
in capital per person.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is investment.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So the capital stock per person
will be growing as we invest.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It shrinks with the passage
of time just because

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:90%
of depreciation.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Some things break down.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
That reduces the
stock of capital.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But the new term
that we introduce

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last lecture,
is that now this ratio also

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:90%
declines with population growth.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And so who can explain
why we get this term?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, look,
suppose that we

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
have take as given the
amount of investment.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
We take as given depreciation.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But now I say,
well, if gn rises,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest
remains constant,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
then the left-hand side
will start declining,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:84%
or it will grow less
rapidly than what's going

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:90%
to grow before I increase gn.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is that the case?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's counterintuitive.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason I thought I
rush in the previous lecture

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:90%
over that.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And since it's going to be an
important intermediate step

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
into the next one, which
is going to introduce

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
technological
progress, I want us

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to understand why that gn
appears with a negative sign

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] returns
for the same amount of capital

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that have increased
in [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT CABALLERO: That term
is going to be captured here.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to play a role.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But this one comes from
something much more mechanical

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Hint, observe what I have
on the left-hand side.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't have on the
left-hand side, the change

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
in the stock of capital.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I have the change in the
stock of capital per person.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So suppose I don't change
the stock of capital

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
at all from this period to the
next, but population grows.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What happens to this
expression here?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Decreases, it becomes
negative because I

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
haven't changed
the capital stock,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:90%
but the denominator is growing.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the gn part.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And that means this
term's negative.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this term is here

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:84%
for is to capture the fact
that the denominator Now.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Is also moving on the
left-hand side variable.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And you say, so what?

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, I
care about the capital.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Why do I care about
capital per person?

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.362 align:middle line:84%
Well, my analysis,
I told you it's

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
much easier if I
do it on something

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
which has a steady state.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason I'm
looking for this normalization.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But once I look at the dynamic
equation of accumulation

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:84%
of capital in this
divided by population,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
then I need to take into account
the fact that my denominator is

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:90%
also moving, OK.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
that gn is there.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.973 align:middle line:84%
And again, the reason I
wanted to pause on this

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is because when we introduce
technological progress,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
a similar effect.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
And so I want you to understand.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
counterintuitive

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
because it sounds like
technological progress is

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
something negative.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not negative.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But in this space, it turns
out that if population

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
grows very fast, then you
need a lot of investment

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to keep up the capital-labor
ratio constant, OK.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:84%
If population is not growing, I
don't need a lot of investment

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to keep the capital-labor
ratio constant.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But if population is
growing very fast,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
then I need a lot of
investment to really

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:90%
keep that ratio constant.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
is capturing there.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So to repeat, if this
guy is very large,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
then I need a lot
of investment here

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to make this thing
equal to zero.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So the capital is stock per
person is not declining.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
That's idea, OK.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Good, OK, so and then I said--

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is where we finished.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, OK, so let's
go back to our diagram.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Once I have everything in
this space, k over Ni, n,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
I can go back to our diagram.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Assume that ga is equal to zero.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know what
a is for the time being.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:90%
You will know in five minutes.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But assume ga is equal to
zero, then that's exactly

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
the model we had before.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.533 align:middle line:84%
So and remember, this is
exactly the same diagram.

00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It looked the same, at
least, that we had when

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:90%
population was not growing.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying I can use
the same diagram when

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
population is growing as well.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
important difference,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
which is this curve
looks exactly the same.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
This is just output
per worker, OK.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the blue line.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The green line looks exactly
the same as in the basic model.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just little s
times the blue line.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's exactly the same.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:90%
But this line is different.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
What happens to this
red line as gn goes up?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to this
line as gn goes up?

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Becomes steeper, no?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.195 align:middle line:90%
So it rotates up, OK.

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:90%
It goes up.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And that can sound
counterintuitive sometimes

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
because you say, look
what happens here.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's spend time on this.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that we are at some
steady state, say this one.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.115 align:middle line:90%
And now population growth rises.

00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, it sounds like Ireland
in 2000s and so on.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So population
growth rises a lot.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:90%
What happens in this diagram?

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we are at
the steady state here.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:59.355 align:middle line:84%
No, and that steady
state investment saving,

00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to
investment, is exactly what

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to maintain
the stock of capital

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:90%
per person constant, OK.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what the red line
tells us, that here.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:90%
So the gap here is--

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
this is a gap between
investment and what

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you need to maintain the stock
of capital per person constant.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So when the gap is zero,
then this left-hand side

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
is equal to zero.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's the red line.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the green line.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
When this is equal to
zero, that's equal to that.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly that point.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, but I'm saying, suppose
we are at that point,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and now population growth rises?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:90%
So what moves in that diagram?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Does the blue line move?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.207 align:middle line:84%
I don't see gn in the blue line,
so the blue line doesn't move.

00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If the blue line doesn't
move, and the saving rate

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
hasn't changed, then the green
line doesn't move either.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.453 align:middle line:84%
So for this diagram to be
interesting, what moves?

00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Something has to move.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that it
has that can move here,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:90%
is the red line.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the red line, we
already said, if gn goes up,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:90%
it's going to rotate upwards.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
That means, OK, so now
we have that line there.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So what happens at the
previous stage stock of capital

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
per worker at this level?

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.195 align:middle line:90%
Is that a new steady state?

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
No, but what happens
in particular?

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying, suppose
that you are here,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and now I rotate
the red line up.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means
the red line that

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
represents the
amount of capital I

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
need to maintain the
stock of capital constant

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is greater than how much is
society saving and therefore

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:90%
investing.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.184 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen
to capital per worker?

00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Decrease.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT CABALLERO: Decrease,
exactly because you need

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:90%
more than you're investing.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.463 align:middle line:84%
So the capital stock
has to decline.

00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's what will happen.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
The new steady state is going
to be to the left of that point

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
That sounds very weird.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
How can it be that-- after all,
labor contributes to output.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
How can it be that we end up
with a lower output per worker

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
when we increase
population growth?

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Is population growth bad in
a sense for growth itself

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:90%
for output?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is no.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It's true that the
new steady state will

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:90%
have lower output per person.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.643 align:middle line:90%
So in that sense, it's bad.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:90%
You have lots of population.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
If you don't change the
saving rate or something,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
then output per
person will be lower,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
but output will be
higher than it used

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:90%
to be at any point in time.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It just happens that
in the transition,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
the growth of output--

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
so the growth of
output in this model

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is going to be equal to
the growth of population.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's if you have a
steady state, where population

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
is growing and output per worker
or per person is not growing,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that means output is growing
at the same rate as population.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So that means that if I increase
the rate of population growth,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the rate of growth of output
will increase together

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:84%
with the rate of
growth of population.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But in the transition, as the
output per capita goes lower,

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
output will grow
less than population.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
is happening here.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:90%
But output is growing.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
If population starts growing,
if you increase migration,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:90%
you're going to see output grow.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But output per person
will start declining,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
until you get to a
new steady state.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And then you'll get the same--

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
you'll get the
higher rate of growth

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
if you continue with
population growth

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
population growth.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But output per worker will
be slightly lower rate, OK.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, this may have
been fast, the last part.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But since I'm going
to repeat it now,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
in the context of technological
progress, we should be fine, OK.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a little
confused now, it's OK.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're a little confused
at the end of the lecture,

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not OK because I'm counting
with you sort of getting it

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in the second pass,
OK, the second try, OK.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So next step is following.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So here, we assume
already population growth,

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
but we assume the technology,
so the production function

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
stay put for any combination
of capital and labor.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to think what
happens when the technology

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
itself is getting
better over time.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
technological progress, OK.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:90%
This is TFP.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Let me not get
into the specifics.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
At the end, I'll
say a little more.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But this TFP stands for
Total Factor Productivity.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And this index here
captures the level of TFP

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:90%
in the US over time.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's clearly growing.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So technology is getting
better and better over time.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%
What that means?

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll say a little
more, not a lot more,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
but it's getting better.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
we have here is

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.393 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to address
next is, how does this?

00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to put together

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.437 align:middle line:84%
our entire economic
growth model.

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
population growth.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
also technology growing.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Up to now, the only reason you
could grow output per worker,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
was because you were
accumulating lots of capital.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.305 align:middle line:84%
You were catching up
with your steady state.

00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what would
make you grow faster,

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:90%
but then there was nothing else.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
TFP is going to be the
only growth in technology.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
the only thing that

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
will give you sustainable
growth in the long run in output

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:90%
per person.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very important
component of growth.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's the
only thing that will

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:84%
make you growth in a sustainable
manner in per-person terms.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The previous model
didn't have that.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
In the previous model,
we had a steady state

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%
on output per worker.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So in the previous
model, we didn't

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
have growth in output per
worker in the steady state.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We could have transitional
growth when we were catching up.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
If you started
here, then you were

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
going to have
growth, fast growth,

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:84%
but eventually, we'll put it
out, OK, output per worker.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So up to now, we
don't have a reason

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
to explain why we see
that output per worker

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
grows in most
economies in the world.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:90%
And the answer will be this.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
really output per worker

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:90%
can grow in a sustained manner.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Technology is getting
better and better over time.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's see, so
the question is,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
let's now see what this
does to the model we have.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, in practice, technological
progress takes many, many forms.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
At the most basic
level, it means

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.162 align:middle line:84%
that you can produce larger
quantities of output,

00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
the meaning we're

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.230 align:middle line:84%
going to have here, larger
quantities of output

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:84%
for the same amount
of capital and labor.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have 10
machines 10 workers,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
technological progress
means, well, you

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
used to produce 12
units, now we're

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
going to produce 12, 14,
15, and so on and so forth.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the main ways
technological progress shows up.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
We can do more with
the same if you will.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Second dimension
is better product.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that you
produce more cars,

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.825 align:middle line:84%
but you produce better cars,
better computers, and so on, OK.

00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
That's another dimension
of technological progress.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:84%
You can produce new products,
things that didn't even exist,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
but now you have.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
That counts more than having
one more unit of good.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.418 align:middle line:84%
It counts more because
you have things

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't even
satisfy in the past,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you can satisfy now because you
have this certain kind of goods.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:90%
That the nx is before.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
important dimension

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
of technological
progress, it just

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
creates new sort
of forms of inputs

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:90%
of production and technologies.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Think of AI what that will
do to technology in general

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and to consumption
very directly.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I mean.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Even within a product,
you can get more variety.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And more variety,
it improves welfare

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
because you can align better
the needs with the product

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
make it very simple.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
In this course, we're going to
model technological progress

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:90%
as if it was workers.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
capture technology

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
with this variable a,
which is going to be--

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:84%
we're going to model
it as labor equivalent.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That is, if a grows, it's
going to count for us as

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.492 align:middle line:90%
if we had more workers.

00:23:25.492 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:84%
That's just one
way of modeling it.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can do it in
many different ways,

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and many of these
are equivalent.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very
nice way of modeling,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
so we can use exactly the same
diagrams we had and so on, OK.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
technological progress.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The way I'm going
to model this here,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
is you can think of
technological progress

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
as if this economy was
receiving more workers.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Or a more accurate description
is, with the same workers,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:84%
it's as if it had
more labor input, OK.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
That's one way of capturing
technological progress.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So now that means that I'm
going to refer to this term

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
a n as effective labor.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So with the same
number of n bodies,

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I may get more effective
labor because each worker

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:90%
can produce more things.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a better input
of production,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:90%
factor of production, OK.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I like to model it
this way because now I

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
can use exactly the same
diagrams we had before,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:84%
but rather than
normalizing by population,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to normalize by
effective label, by a n.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.652 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.652 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
So, let me do that.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So recall that we had
our production function

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:90%
with constant returns.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:90%
So this holds.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to set this
x now as 1 over a n.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:90%
We used to have one over n.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have one over a n.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to now have
output per effective worker

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to be also the
same little function

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
f of capital per
effective worker.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And what is nice of
this, is that now here

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than plotting y over n,
I'm going to plot y over a n.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Rather than plotting
k over n here,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to plot k over a n.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have the blue line looks
exactly like it used to look.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just I'm
dividing by a over n.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the trick
in all these models,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is to find the right
normalization, that

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
is to find the right x, So
I can find a steady state

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%
in my diagram.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want these curves
to be moving around.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a steady
state, something, a point

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to converge to
after enough time has passed.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
thing that will do it

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in a model in which I have
effective workers growing,

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is one in which I divide
everything by effective workers.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.895 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what
I'm doing here.

00:25:52.895 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to build
a diagram that

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
looks like the other one
that has a nice steady state

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
as the previous one had, OK.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:90%
So I have my blue line.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.263 align:middle line:90%
Here I have my blue line.

00:26:01.263 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I know I have my green line, no,
because the green line was just

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:90%
little s times the blue line.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:90%
So I have that.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I need, and
I already showed you that,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to show it
again, is the red line.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But for the red line, I
need to find the term--

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
remember, the red line
represents the capital

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
we need to maintain the
current stock of capital

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:90%
per effective worker constant.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what I need
my red line for.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's get there.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.463 align:middle line:84%
And it always starts
from this equation.

00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So this equation is still
the same as it used to be.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't change.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm going to do now,
is rather than dividing by n,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to divide
by a times n.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So the same as I did
earlier in this lecture.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I now I want to
divide by a over n.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So I get capital per effective
worker on the left-hand side.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't like what
I get here, but you

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
know that I can divide and
multiply by a n, n over a n.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So I can write the
right-hand side

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.365 align:middle line:84%
after I do all my
substitutions as this.

00:27:02.365 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So first step one,
I divided everything

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:90%
by a t plus 1 times nt plus 1.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Step two, I multiply each of
these terms by a, t, and t.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I multiply by a, t, and t.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Divide by a, t, and t and.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I regroup things,
So I end up with that.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, this, using
the approximation

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
we have here, is approximately
equal to 1 minus gan and gan,

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%
is equal to ga plus gn.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I already showed
you that case

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
for the case in which
ga was equal to zero.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing now.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The same thing but, since
I renormalized things

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:84%
by effective workers, effective
labor rather than actual labor,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I need to use a n rather than n.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then by the same
approximation I had before,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
which is that these
products are close to zero,

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
then I get to the
equation I want.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And if I write it
in first difference,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
then I get my red line.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.065 align:middle line:90%
This is my red line here.

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:25.565 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:25.565 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me that
when the green line is

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
equal to the red line,
then I have a steady state.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Capital perfected
work is constant,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and this is equal to zero.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I
find my steady state.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
If I ask you a question,
find the steady state

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of this economy,
what you'll do is

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.570 align:middle line:84%
you'll set this equal to
zero and find the capital

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
stock that gives you
this equal to zero.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the way you do it, OK.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And then we get back to--

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
well, this is the
same as we had before.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what I just said.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you find
the steady state, OK.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
back to the diagram

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I started with in this lecture.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But now we have here a n,
and now, in the first part,

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I said assume this
ga equal to 0.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Now the main actor
is ga positive, OK,

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and we get this diagram.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So now I can ask
you the question

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that I asked you before
with population growth,

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and see how much
I can confuse you.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Suppose that ga goes up.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like
a good thing, no.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suppose that we are
at the steady state here,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and this diagram
has too much stuff.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we're here.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
That's our initial
steady state zero.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And this line here is delta plus
ga plus gn times k over a n, OK.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:31:01.615 align:middle line:84%
So well first, so suppose
we are the steady state.

00:31:01.615 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.100 align:middle line:90%
Its output constant there.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a steady state.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Is output constant there?

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we are
at that point here.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Here, we know that investment
is exactly how much we

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:84%
need to maintain the stock of
capital per effective worker

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
constant.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
steady state means.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.245 align:middle line:84%
Question, is output
constant there?

00:31:34.245 --> 00:31:35.395 align:middle line:90%
It's steady state.

00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:84%
This only says that capital per
effective worker is constant.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That means that if effective
workers or labor is growing,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:84%
then capital is growing
at the same rate

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, output is
growing at the same rate

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:90%
as effective workers, OK.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the whole trick,
so the curves would not

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:84%
be moving around, is I find
the right normalization.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.045 align:middle line:84%
So everything is growing at the
same rate in that steady state.

00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So let me actually
show you that, and then

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go over the
experiment I want to have.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is what is happening
in that steady state.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So capital per effective
worker at the steady state,

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:90%
so at that point there, is zero.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
That's my definition
of a steady state, OK.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Output per effective worker is
also growing at the rate zero.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:90%
That's that one over there.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.500 align:middle line:84%
That's my steady state level
of output per effective worker.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:90%
So these are constant.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a steady state.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Those are constant.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:90%
This ratio is constant.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Each of those components is not.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
plotting there.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:90%
So those are not growing.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Capital per worker,
what about that?

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, you see there.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So claim, capital per worker
is growing at the rate ga.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So the question
I'm asking there,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:84%
is what is the rate of growth
of k over n given that I already

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:26.639 align:middle line:84%
know that the rate of growth
of k over a n is equal to zero?

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:33.860 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, this, the rate
of growth of k over n,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is the rate of
growth of k over a n

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
plus the rate of
growth of a, no.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if a is growing
and this ratio is constant,

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that means that k over
n must be growing.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be growing
at exactly the same rate

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.862 align:middle line:90%
as this a is growing.

00:35:03.862 --> 00:35:06.445 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to maintain that ratio constant.

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And the same logic applies
to output per worker

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because in that steady state,
output per effective worker

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.110 align:middle line:90%
is constant.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But a is growing,
so output per worker

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:84%
must be growing at the
same rate as a i growing,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:90%
and that's ga, OK, good.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Labor, well, labor is exogenous
which in population, is growing

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:90%
at the rate n that's given.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:90%
What about capital and output?

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, claim, capital
and output are

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:90%
growing at the rate ga plus gn.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can do the same
as I was in here.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking you the
question, gk, what

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:90%
is the rate of growth of gk?

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's going to be equal
to the rate of growth of k

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:84%
over n plus the
rate of growth of n.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:90%
This is equal to ga.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's ga plus gn.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And the same happens
for output, OK.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I said earlier
on, that if an economy has

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
more population growth,
it will grow more.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt of that.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, output per
worker will not grow more

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because population growth grows
more in the new steady state.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.780 align:middle line:90%
gn doesn't show up there.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing that will
make output per worker grow,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:84%
is technological
progress, so it;s ga.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.695 align:middle line:90%
And that was my claim earlier.

00:36:58.695 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:90%
We're going to use this later.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not going to
do this to myself now.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.427 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get back
to what I wanted to now.

00:37:22.427 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I need to tell
you a little bit more

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.740 align:middle line:84%
about the production function
to growth accounting,

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.320 align:middle line:90%
which is what I wanted to do.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:90%
So but this is clear.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is important, OK.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reason ga is
such an important variable.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:84%
What you guys do here at
MIT is very important.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.897 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, it's
very important, OK.

00:37:48.897 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing that
can drive really growth

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:90%
in the long run, in per capita.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.140 align:middle line:90%
This gn plays also a role.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You look at countries, not only
the growth in per capita output.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You tend to look at
growth at total growth.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the big concerns
in big parts of Asia

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
now, in Europe as well, as I
said earlier in the course,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:90%
is that gn is turning negative.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to affect
output per worker growth,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
but it does affect
output growth in general.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it here.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So if dn goes down,
that will reduce

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:90%
the rate of growth of output.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't reduce the rate of
growth output per worker,

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:84%
but it does reduce the rate
of growth of output, good.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happens-- remember,
we did in the basic EOQ

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
we did an experiment in which
we increased the savings rate.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:90%
So we can do the same here.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we get an
increase in the savings rate?

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Do we get more growth
in the long run?

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, for the
same reasons we had before, no.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:84%
If we increase the
savings rate in this,

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:84%
now, this full model,
all that happens

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is that this green
line moves up.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It means that at the
initial steady state, now

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
we have more savings.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, more
investment than we

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
need to maintain the stock of
capital per effective worker

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
constant, which means
that we're going

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.760 align:middle line:90%
to get transitional growth.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Capital per effective worker
will start growing, for a while.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And as that happens,
output per effective worker

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.500 align:middle line:90%
will also start growing.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
decreasing returns

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:90%
will kick in here, as well.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And that transitional
growth will stop,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and we'll end up at a
higher level of output

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
per effective worker and
a higher level of capital

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:84%
per effective worker, but the
rate of growth, in the long run,

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
will not be affected
by the saving rate.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll get more
transitional growth,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:55.590 align:middle line:84%
but we will not get
faster long-term growth.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the Asian miracle,
the Southeast Asian miracle

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in particular, we saw
very fast rates of growth

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in many economies of Asia,
was a lot of that kind,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:84%
meaning was a combination
of what we had before.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Economies that were relatively
poor had low capital per worker

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.430 align:middle line:84%
early on in which the saving
rate increased enormously.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And that combination gave them
enormous transitional growth.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:90%
So rate of growth of 10%, 12%.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
That was Japan, and then it
was Korea, Taiwan, and so on.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:84%
All those economies had
very fast rate of growth

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.850 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:84%
China, later on, and China
was a big thing for the world

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because it was much
bigger at the same time.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But it was mostly a combination
of those two things.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It was having a lower stock
of capital early on combined

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
with, for a variety of reasons,
an increase in the savings rate.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And that combination gave them
very fast transitional growth.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But they all getting
a little stuck now.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
concerned with that.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're fighting
against this model.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.480 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of concerns of
what is happening to China.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to follow
the Japan path and so on.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
following this model.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what is happening
to our first order.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll say a little bit
more later on about that.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular case, what
I have done is, in log space,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.300 align:middle line:84%
so I can have linear things
when it's growing, in log space,

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:32.360 align:middle line:84%
this economy with the low
saving rate was growing here.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:84%
This is output, so the slope
of this was ga plus gn.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in the steady state,
output is growing at ga plus gn.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:84%
If the saving rate
now increases,

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.560 align:middle line:84%
then output starts growing
transitionally faster

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:90%
than ga plus gn.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
output grows faster than--

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:84%
here, it's growing
faster than [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.782 align:middle line:90%
Here, it's very fast, OK.

00:41:54.782 --> 00:41:56.990 align:middle line:84%
This is what we saw in
[INAUDIBLE] the rate of growth

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:90%
of 12% and stuff like that.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:90%
We were there moving there.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And but eventually,
it sort of peters out.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You end up with a higher level
of output per capita per worker,

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.710 align:middle line:84%
a higher sort of
path, an entire path.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:84%
The rate of growth goes
back to ga plus gn,

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.260 align:middle line:84%
but you get this transitional
growth, which is very strong.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And once you're here,
once you run out

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:84%
of the high saving and
the catching up growth

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and so on, the only way
you're going to really change

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:84%
your rate of growth in a
sustained manner is doing what?

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.900 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Once you have used the
tool of catching up

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
with the world, of increasing
your saving rate sometimes

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.570 align:middle line:84%
to levels that incredibly
high, you still

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:90%
want to keep growing very fast.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:84%
What is the only option you
have according to this model?

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, let me bring
even more realism to the story.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, if gn is
dropping, and you still

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:90%
want to keep your growth high.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And your gn now, you used
the catching up growth.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.807 align:middle line:84%
You used the higher saving
rate, which gives you

00:43:22.807 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:84%
transitional growth,
but it doesn't give you

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:84%
permanently higher
rate of growth.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that. for
reasons you don't control,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
population growth
is declining, even

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:90%
turning negative in some cases.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But suppose you still want
to keep the rate of growth

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:90%
very high.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.145 align:middle line:84%
What is the only
option you have.

00:43:40.145 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Increase ga.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.887 align:middle line:90%
Increase ga.

00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT CABALLERO: Exactly,
technological progress,

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.303 align:middle line:90%
that's the only option you have.

00:43:46.303 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:90%
So it makes sense.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.070 align:middle line:84%
You see, that in
the case of China.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:84%
They're obsessed about
technology and so on.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:90%
They understand the Solow model.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:84%
If you want to maintain
growth at a high pace,

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.317 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need to
work on that side a lot.

00:44:00.317 --> 00:44:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't have
to be you, necessarily.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.072 align:middle line:84%
It's the world as a whole
because technology moves

00:44:05.072 --> 00:44:05.780 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But ga is at the end what puts
the limits of what we can do.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.070 align:middle line:90%


00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:84%
What I was going
to do is, that's

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
what I was drawing this
diagram for, is say,

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:84%
well, suppose that
in this situation,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:90%
we are in a steady state.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And we do increase ga.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:90%
What happens if we increase ga?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, this curve rotates up, no.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it's
clear that if ga grows,

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start
growing at the faster rate.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But transitionally,
actually, you're

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.245 align:middle line:84%
going to grow less than in
your long-term rate of growth.

00:44:44.245 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Why is that the case?

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So my claim is, suppose
we manage to increase ga.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that this line
here now is a bit steeper.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Or say this.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:84%
We were in this line,
whatever, we were in this line,

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and now we make it steeper.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So we want to start
growing faster, eventually,

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:90%
in the new steady state.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And my claim now, is
that in the transition,

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:84%
growth is less than the
new rate of growth--

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:84%
in the new steady
state rate of growth.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It's higher than
the rate of growth

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of the previous
steady state, but it's

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.400 align:middle line:90%
lower than the long run.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:90%
How do I see that?

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I need another diagram, I think.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:37.520 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So let me just put
the sy curve here.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're here at
this steady state.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.740 align:middle line:84%
If I increase ga,
the only thing that

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:84%
will move here, and remember
the output equation is there

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to put
it, the only thing I do,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.560 align:middle line:90%
is I rotate this curve up.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this moves up.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So this curves moves
up when ga goes up.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So at the old steady
state, what I have now

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is a gap between the savings,
this economy in investment,

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and how much I need in
order to maintain capital

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:84%
per effective worker
constant, which

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:84%
means that I'm going to start
moving in this direction,

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
until I reach the
new steady state.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, during this transition,
I'm growing at a lower pace

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:90%
than in the new steady state.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:47.255 align:middle line:84%
In this new steady state,
I'll be growing at a much

00:46:47.255 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
faster than in
this steady state.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:90%
How much faster?

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, equal to delta ga.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the transition, I
will grow faster than that

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.640 align:middle line:84%
but not as fast as in
the new steady state.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the claim I was making.

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:16.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.457 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd rather
discuss this with more time.

00:47:19.457 --> 00:47:21.415 align:middle line:84%
So questions about what
we have done up to now?

00:47:21.415 --> 00:47:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it clear, or is
it very unclear?

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.295 align:middle line:90%
Probably both.

00:47:35.295 --> 00:47:39.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So let me keep this
for the next lecture

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because might take a
little time to explain, OK.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:90%
