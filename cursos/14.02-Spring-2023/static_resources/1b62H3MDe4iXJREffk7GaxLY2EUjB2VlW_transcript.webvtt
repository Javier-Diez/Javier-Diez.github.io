RICARDO CABALIERO:
So now we're going

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the first part
of the course in the sense

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to go
back to the short term.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to essentially do
the IS-LM model again, but now

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
an open economy.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But before I get
into that first model

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of this part of
the course, I want

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to finish the previous lecture
in which I was introducing

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the concept of openness
and the key relative prices

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:90%
in open economy.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped after
discussing this and says,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
well, one of the things that
opening an economy means

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.988 align:middle line:84%
is that now you can buy
goods, both at home or abroad.

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be able
to compare these two

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of goods and
controlling for quality and all

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:90%
these differences and all that.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
you want some sense

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of relative prices,
which good is more

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:90%
expensive than the other one.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And we said for that, we
use what is called the "real

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
exchange,"

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And we define the real
exchange rate as well,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
essentially it's
the relative prices

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:90%
of goods at home versus abroad.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
But we have to put them
in a common currency.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.372 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we
couldn't just directly

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
compare the prices at home
versus the prices abroad.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to convert
the prices at home

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
to the unit of account
of the other country.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.332 align:middle line:84%
And then we could
compare these two things.

00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the real exchange rate.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
When that thing
goes up, we call--

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that's a real appreciation
of the local currency,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
of the local economy.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And that means that the goods--

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
domestic goods--
become more expensive

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
relative to international goods.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
When that epsilon goes
down, then we call,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
we say the real exchange
rate has depreciated.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the domestic
goods become cheaper relative

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:90%
to foreign goods.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So as a key concept in what it
means when you open an economy,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
you need to have this price
is very important to decide

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
whether you're going to, again,
whether you and foreigners are

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
going to buy goods
abroad or domestically.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The second concept of
openness that we're

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
going to explore in this course
is openness in capital account,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:90%
in financial market.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And openness in financial market
means something very similar,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
which is now you when
you have a to invest--

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
financially invest, not
physical investment,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
not real investment--
well, you can

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
decide whether to invest
in domestic assets

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
or foreign assets.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.708 align:middle line:90%
We're going in this--

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
later on, we're going
to talk about equity.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:90%
But for now, bonds.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have a domestic
bond and a foreign bond.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can decide whether
to invest in the domestic bond

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:90%
or in the foreign bond.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Now to make that
comparison, it's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
not enough to have the current
exchange rate because it doesn't

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
mean much if I tell you
that the British bond is

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
more expensive than
a domestic $1 bond.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
What you really need in order
to decide where to invest

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is some sense of what is
expected relative return

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
of these two things.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Do I expect to make more
money in the dollar bond

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:90%
or in the pound bond?

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the comparison
I need to be able to make.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There are also
risk considerations

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and so on that we're not going
to discuss in this course.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But the very basic comparison
is not the value of things

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about financial,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.405 align:middle line:84%
but what is the
return you expect

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:90%
to get in one or the other.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is what you need to do.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have a dollar to
invest and you have two options.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
One is you buy $1 bond.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
The dollar bond gives you
an interest rate of it.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So you know that, say, 5%
nowadays, more or less,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a dollar today
and you invest it in a dollar

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
bond, you're going to get next
period, you're going to get a--

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.102 align:middle line:90%
how much is it, $100?

00:04:15.102 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have
$1, then you're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
going to get a $0.05 on that
dollar at the end of the year.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what you get if
you invest in the dollar bond.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're giving now
an option because we

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
are open to financial
markets, to also

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
invest in a British bond,
in a pound bond that is

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:90%
as safe as the US bonds, say.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
call that the UK bond.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know, for example,
that the UK bond is

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:90%
offering a 10% interest rate.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that I
think i star is 10%.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked you
the question, well,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that does mean that
obviously, since you

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
want to compare returns that you
should be investing in the pound

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
bond, in the UK bond
rather than the US bond.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.003 align:middle line:84%
So suppose this is
5%, and that's 10%.

00:05:07.003 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, where do
you want to invest your money?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to invest it in
the US bond or in the UK bond?

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
What is your answer?

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I told you, you know,
they pay you 10%,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.465 align:middle line:90%
the other one pays you 5%.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] as well?

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Exactly.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.981 align:middle line:90%
Why do I need to know that?

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.642 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Excellent.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is not enough
information for me,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because it may happen that
what I get in terms of return,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I lose on the currency
exposure, for example.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's see how
that can happen.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
So how would I do this?

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I have $1 of wealth
that I want to invest.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And suppose I want to
go the UK bond route.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I have to do is

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I have to convert the
dollar into pounds today

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to buy my dollar, which is my UK
bond, which will be in pounds.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I
have to use is suppose

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that I get a 0.8
pounds per dollar,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
then I can invest 0.8 pounds
in, UK bonds with my dollar.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
That will give me 0.8 times
1.1, plus i star tomorrow,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
but what are the units of this?

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:90%
What do I get there?

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Next year, what do
I get next year?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I invested 0.8 pounds and I got
0.8 times 1.1, say, pounds back.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I just told you.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I get next
year is pounds.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I cannot compare a
return in dollars,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
which this was $1.05
with a return on pounds.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I need to be able to convert
those pounds in the future

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to dollars in the future.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And the best I can
do here, we're not

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
going to open four world
markets or anything, is well,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I can-- that means I have to
divide by the exchange rate

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
next year to convert
from pounds to dollars.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't the exchange rate of
next year, so the best I can do

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:90%
is use expected exchange rate.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So I divide this by the
expected exchange rate next year

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and then I get--

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
thus, my return in dollars of
having gone the UK bond route.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what I need
to compare in order

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
to decide where do I
want to put my money

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is that return here
versus that one there.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
That's in the same
units of account

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
is I invest the same today,
$1, and I get dollars tomorrow.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:90%
So now I can compare.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you correctly
pointed out,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
this thing here
therefore requires

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that you think about
what the exchange

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
rate is likely to be tomorrow.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
in my example here,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
when I said suppose
i is 5% and i

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
star, the interest rate
in the UK bond, is 10%.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it obvious that I should
invest in the UK bond?

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
no, not so fast.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I'm going
to make 5% more in terms

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:90%
of return of the bond.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But then when I convert
it back to dollars,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I may lose all that gain because
the pound has depreciated

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:90%
vis-a-vis the dollar.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
In particular, is the
pound, I expect the pound

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
to depreciate
relative to the dollar

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or if I expect the dollar to
appreciate relative to the pound

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
by 5%, then I'm indifferent.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:90%
In one case, I'll get--

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
because if I go
the US bond route,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I get 5% next year from
this year to the next.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If I go to the UK
bond route, I get 10%

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
in return on the bond
minus 5% in the capital

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
loss due to the
appreciation of the dollar.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:90%
So net I get 5% as well.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.555 align:middle line:90%
That's what appears here.

00:08:58.555 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've done here.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So what I did here is says if
the markets are very integrated

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and the function fairly
well, those two returns

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.102 align:middle line:84%
should be more or less
similar in equilibrium,

00:09:09.102 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
because prices are
going to adjust,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
exchanges are going
to adjust and so on.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.647 align:middle line:84%
So there's two ways of investing
are more or less the same.

00:09:16.647 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
the extreme assumption

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
that they are exactly the
same here so that this holds.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
That in equilibrium, we have
to find that equilibrium,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
these two things are
going to be equal.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
That's called-- and it's
a very important concept

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:90%
in international finance--

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
the "uncovered interest
parity condition."

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me why it's uncovered,
but it's the interest parity

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, that
one in particular

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
is called the uncovered
interest parity condition.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
If you do a little bit of--
and this just tells you

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that in equilibrium you have to
be indifferent between investing

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:90%
in one bond or the other.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
If you do a little
algebra here of the kind

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have done in
the past, like 1 plus i

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
is i is approximately equal to
1 over 1 minus i or this one,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
1 plus i star is approximately
equal to 1 over 1 minus i star,

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
That's a kind of approximation,
Taylor expansion,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:90%
when these terms are small.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you can write this
as this expression here.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And this says exactly
what I just said in words.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
It says, look, if the
interest rate in the US bond

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is lower than the UK bond's
interest rate, that's

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
OK in the sense that
we can be indifferent

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
when we do those things as
long as you're expecting

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:90%
an appreciation of the dollar.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
That is equivalent to the
difference in these two interest

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's called the
interest parity condition.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The two, in
equilibrium, the two are

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
same once you adjust

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:84%
for the expected appreciation
or depreciation of the currency.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So in my example before,
we had this interest rate

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:90%
of 5%, that was 10%.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Then the only way that that's
going to be in equilibrium

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:84%
is that if we also expect the
dollar to appreciate by 5%.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so dollar appreciation,
remember, is this guy going up.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So if this is 5%, then
it's fine to have 5% here,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
10% there, because they
both gave me the same return

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:90%
in expectation, at least.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
If I do it in dollars, I
say I'm going to get 5%

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
either way investing in American
dollars, or through the UK pound

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
because in the UK bond and
the bond, I'm going to get 10%

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and then lose 5%
because of the currency.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Or I can do the
comparison in pounds

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and then I say, well, I'm going
to get 10% in pounds directly.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And if I go the US way,
I'm going to get 5%,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to get also 5%
in the currency appreciation.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:90%
And that gives me 10%.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Key concept.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, so these
are the two senses

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of opening that we can have,
opening in goods market,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
opening in financial markets.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And the key relative
prices and things

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
equilibrate both markets.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And one is the real exchange
rate in the goods market,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and this one is the uncovered
interest parity condition.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to shut down this part
of openness for a lecture or so,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to focus now on
the goods market opening only.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to come back to this.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to show you
the two senses of opening.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So now let's forget a little
bit about financial opening

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and let's just focus
on opening the goods

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:90%
markets to international trade.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So that means we're
going to have now imports

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and exports floating around.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.355 align:middle line:84%
So this is, we'll go back
again to our IS-LM model to--

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:06.230 align:middle line:84%
actually, we're going
to go back to our goods

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
market only model, the
very first model we

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:90%
saw in this course.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to bring
back a couple of terms

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
that we shut down there.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.702 align:middle line:84%
Now something that will
be-- that we didn't

00:13:17.702 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
need to worry about,
but what we're

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:84%
going to have to worry
about here a lot,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a
distinction between the demand

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
for domestic goods and the
domestic demand for goods.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:90%
This can be tricky.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
difference between demand

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
for domestic goods versus the
domestic demand for goods.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what residents say, US
residents, households firms,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
government demand
in terms of goods.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
This is how those same agents,
plus the rest of the world,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
demand of
domestically-produced goods.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the distinction.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
When the economy was
closed, they were the same,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:90%
but now they're not.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So the domestic demand
remains the same as before.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Domestic demand is whatever
the households demand--

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
consumption--

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
plus firms investment, plus
government expenditure.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the same we
had in closed economy.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
This hasn't changed.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:90%
The domestic demand is the same.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a function of the
same behavioral functions

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.917 align:middle line:90%
that we had there.

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And the only behavioral
function that was-- the only two

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that we had was the consumption
function and the investment

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.958 align:middle line:90%
function, remember?

00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So that remains the same.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has changed.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
What does change is that
this is no longer what

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
determines the demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And remember, that's very
key in the short run,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
because this is a Keynesian
model with very sticky prices.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Demand determines
output activity.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to determine
domestic production from demand,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
we better be very
careful about what

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
is the demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
This is demand for both
domestically-produced goods

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and foreign-produced goods.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of those demands will
be satisfied by imports.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
That's not demand for
domestic production,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we will not be
determining equilibrium output

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:90%
domestically.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
a new concept, which

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
is demand for domestic goods.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And demand for domestic
goods is the same as demand--

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
as domestic demand
for goods that--

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
the thing we have in
a closed economy--

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
minus that part of demand
that is satisfied by imports.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So minus imports and
divided by the exchange rate

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
because imports may
be priced in euros,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
say, and I have to
convert them into dollars.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very changing.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry
about this for now.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have to subtract
from that imports.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that's demand by
residents, US residents.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't go to demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Is demand for BMW, whatever.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's not going to affect
the demand for Ford cars

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, will not affect
the production of Ford cars

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
demand for that.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.942 align:middle line:84%
But against that, we
also have a component

00:16:07.942 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of demand for
domestically-produced goods

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't have
before, which is what

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:90%
foreigners demand from the US.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Part of the demand that US
would-- probably not Ford a lot,

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:90%
at least.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Part of the demand that
US goods perceived--

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
US production perceived--
is not due to residents,

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
it's due to foreigners that
are importing US goods.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Apple sells a lot of phones
to the rest of the world.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That's determined
by foreign demand

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:90%
for domestically-produced goods.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.125 align:middle line:90%
That's what I call X, exports.

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is our new
key concept here,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Z. We're just the same
as we used to have.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But now we need to
understand two more terms--

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
the export, and that's going to
be a function, and the imports,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
which also will be a function.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:90%
So let me introduce that.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So exports, we're going to
assume to simplify things,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's a sensible
behavioral assumption.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume
that exports are

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:90%
increasing in foreign output.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what Y star means.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the rest of the world.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, emerging market, the
commodity-producing economies

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
today are very excited
about the recovery in China.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
China is reopening so it's
a big boom domestically.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
That's great news for the
emerging markets, commodity

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
producers, because that will
increase the demand from China

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
for goods produced
around the world,

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
in particular in
commodity-producing economies.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
this is capturing.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an important trading
partners' output goes up,

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
income goes up,
then they're going

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to consume everything,
their domestic goods,

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
but they also going to
consume the goods they import,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
which are our exports.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
this is increasing.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Exports are decreasing on
the real exchange rate.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a sensible assumption.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think it's
a sensible assumption?

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
that exports--

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
US exports-- are decreasing
on the real exchange rate?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.465 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Major [INAUDIBLE]
for foreign customers to buy?

00:18:29.465 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Exactly.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Because then US goods
become more expensive

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.553 align:middle line:90%
relative to foreign goods.

00:18:34.553 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where the real
exchange rate appreciation is.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore there is less
demand for domestically, for US

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:90%
goods.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason we have that.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:90%
What about imports?

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, imports are
the dual of that,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:90%
meaning of the export function.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Is actually, our imports
is what the other countries

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:90%
sees as their export.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So our imports will tend to go
up when domestic output goes up,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
because if domestic
income goes up,

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
domestic consumers will both
consume more goods at home,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
but they will also
consume more goods abroad.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
They're going to scale
up their consumption

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
consume from both places.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So imports is an increasing
function of domestic output.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
What about the real
exchange rate here?

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, imports are an increasing
function of the real exchange

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:36.535 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:41.953 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.953 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
argument of exports,

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.578 align:middle line:90%
but seen from the other side.

00:19:44.578 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember when-- why do we use
this epsilon for to decide where

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:90%
do we want to buy our goods?

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
If epsilon goes up, it means
our goods become more expensive.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
If our goods become more
expensive for any given

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
level of domestic
consumption, where do you

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:90%
think you'll buy your goods?

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You'll buy more abroad,
because they're cheaper.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So then that's an increasing
function of epsilon.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Any question about that?

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.322 align:middle line:84%
Because these are the only
sort of new behavioral

00:20:21.322 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
equations that we're going
to have for this model.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going
to do next is I'm

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
going to start from the same
model we had in, I don't know,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:90%
lecture 2 or 3.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:40.405 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to add these
terms and see how things change.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I think the
first curve that we--

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
the very first diagram we had
in this class was this one.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
This was just a demand for
domestic demand, sorry,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
which was just C plus I plus G.
It's an increasing function here

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
because consumption
and investment are

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
increasing function of output.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And then in closed economy, what
we did is we had a 45-degree

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
line here and we
said in equilibrium,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
output equal to demand.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the intersection
of this curve with the 45-degree

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:84%
line gave us our
equilibrium output.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what we had.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to change
things a little bit.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put the 45-degree
line in the next slide.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
But we first need to--

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
this is not the relevant demand
for domestically-produced goods.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So we need to go from
here to the demand that

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is relevant for
domestic producers.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we need to do
is we need to subtract imports.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Because part of that demand
will go for foreign goods.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm doing here.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
To this domestic
demand, I'm subtracting,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the part that is going
to foreign goods,

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
not domestic goods,
because this is not

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, this
is a shift down,

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:90%
but there is also a rotation.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we're subtracting
imports from domestic demand,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:90%
so that moves us down here.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But it also is not
a parallel shift.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.665 align:middle line:90%
This curve becomes flatter.

00:22:27.665 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the decline
is larger for the difference.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
The gap is larger for
high levels of income

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
than for low levels
of income, or output.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.685 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dependent on output?

00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Exactly.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It's because there is a positive
marginal propensity to import.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll import more
if the output is higher.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
we have this curve.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Notice that this
also means, well,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.498 align:middle line:84%
let me get to the end of
that and of these diagrams

00:23:01.498 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll get back to this.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So one step more.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Still, this is not what I need
to integrate with my 45-degree

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
line because this is not the
demand that domestic producers

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:90%
will face.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:84%
We still have to add the demand
that comes from foreigners,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's exports.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So to this AA function,
I have to add exports.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And exports is a parallel
shift because it didn't

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:90%
depend on domestic output.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
It depends on foreign output.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So foreign output is going to
be a parameter in this curve,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:90%
but it's not--

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't change the
slope of that curve.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So here we went
from the DD curve

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to the new curve, which is
the relevant for equilibrium

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
domestic equilibrium output,
which is this ZZ curve.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Now notice two things, or
one thing about this ZZ curve

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
relative to DD.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.843 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
obvious difference

00:23:58.843 --> 00:23:59.885 align:middle line:90%
between these two curves?

00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
No, this is the one we use in
lecture 2 or 3, I don't know.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And then what we did
yesterday and all that.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one we're
going to use now, the ZZ.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It's flatter.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.745 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, why is that?

00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Flatter is low.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Slope will mean
lower multiplier.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Why is the multiplier lower
then, in open economy?

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because part of the
demand falls on foreign goods.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.795 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Exactly.

00:24:32.795 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Because part of the-- remember
the way we got to the multiplier

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is that income went
up, consumption

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.358 align:middle line:84%
went up, that increased income
again and so on and so forth.

00:24:42.358 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But if part of that
increase in consumption

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is going to foreign
goods, that's

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:84%
not reflected in demand for
domestically-produced goods,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and therefore there is
less of a multiplier.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's one characteristic
of an open economy,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is that the multipliers
are smaller.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:90%
The other distinction is that--

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't see it here, but
we have more parameters.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
In particular, a very
important parameter

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:90%
here is Y star, Y star.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
We didn't worry about what
was the income in Germany When

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
we look at the IS-LM,
the closed economy model.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Now we worry about what the
income of our main trading

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:90%
partners is.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
There is an extra
parameter there.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Now we still haven't
found equilibrium output,

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
but there is a point that
is already interesting here,

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:90%
which is this one.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:90%
What do I know of this point?

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this point,
domestic demand for goods

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the demand for
domestically-produced goods,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:90%
for domestic goods.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And that also means that
the trade balance is zero,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning at that point, exports
is exactly equal to imports.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:90%
So net exports are equal to 0.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what I'm
plotting here, actually.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:90%
This is the net export function.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The net export
function is simply

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that minus that divided
by the exchange rate.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
I'm plotting here.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Is a decreasing
function of output.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:14.135 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Why is this decreasing
in domestic output?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is
export minus import

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:90%
divided by the exchange rate.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But we're not moving the
exchange rate for now.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Why is this decreasing?

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
That means here,
exports exceed imports,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:90%
here, imports exceed exports.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
a trade deficit.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Here you have a trade surplus.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Why is that the shape?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Why is it downward sloping?

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.855 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because import grows
when outgrossed by exports.

00:26:55.855 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALIERO: Exactly.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Exports is not a function
of domestic output.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a function
of foreign output,

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
while imports is an increasing
function of domestic output,

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and net export is
exports minus imports.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's why
this is decreasing.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And this point here
happens to be when the two

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:90%
things are exactly balanced.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Thus, trade balance happens
to be the point where

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.988 align:middle line:90%
DD is equal to ZZ.

00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- there's no reason
why equilibrium output should

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:90%
be at that level, I'm saying.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the point
where that happens.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going to find
the equilibrium output.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And to find
equilibrium output, I'm

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
going to erase all
these extra curves here.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to keep the ZZ here,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
because that's the demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing short run
here, so I know that domestic

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:90%
production-- that is the Y--

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to be equal to the
demand for domestic goods.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a demand-determined model.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what the short
run is all about.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So erase all these
curves, and I'm

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
going to just keep
the ZZ curve there.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So now I have my 45-degree
line because in the short run,

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium output is
equal to aggregate demand.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Aggregate demand for what?

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:90%
For domestically produced goods.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
I'm using ZZ, not DD.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, but there you are.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Then you do exactly the
same as we did before.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%
That's our equilibrium output.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.272 align:middle line:84%
And here you can do all
sorts of experiments

00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get
the same type of things

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that we did there,
the multiplier, it's

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
a small multiplier,
but you're going

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to still get a multiplier
and all these kind of things.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is just--

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
in this example, it happens
that this equilibrium output,

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
this country has
a trade deficit.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I just made up that.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
equilibrium condition

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is output equal to Z, output
equal to domestic demand

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:90%
plus exports minus imports.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the net export is just,
I'm plotting this term here.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have here.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But equilibrium is just Y equal
to Z. Is not this equal to 0.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:90%
You can think about equilibrium.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is what it is, given
that that's equilibrium out.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.525 align:middle line:90%
This is clear?

00:29:26.525 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
the start diagram

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:90%
of this part of the course.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.795 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
understand this diagram.

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Go over it.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Play with it.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Think, what is a parameter
in there, and so on.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
little bit of that

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
now, but make sure that
you understand this.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:90%
So there's a few things here.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's do things that
we did in closed economy.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that you
have a fiscal expansion.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So what did we do when we had
a fiscal expansion in lecture 2

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
or 3?

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, that moves
the ZZ curve up.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Output will go up, and then
there will be a multiplier.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So output will go up by more
than the initial increase

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:90%
in government expenditure.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what we had before.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It will go up by more,
but not as much as it

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:90%
did in the closed economy.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So the increasing
output will be more

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
than the increase in
government expenditure,

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:84%
but it will be not as much
as it would have been had

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:90%
we had a closed economy.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.075 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:30:33.075 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Why is the last part true?

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Why not as much as it would
have been in the closed economy?

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can read it here.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's because part of
that extra energy,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
the demand for consumption,
will go to foreign goods.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So it will not come back to
demand more domestic production.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.142 align:middle line:84%
And that's reflected
in the trade deficit.

00:31:05.142 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
In this particular example,
we start with a situation

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:90%
where the trade was balanced.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We had no-- net export
was equal to zero

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up with
a trade deficit.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
That trade deficit is
exactly the same reason

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
why we got a smaller
multiplier is

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
because part of the
extra demand that

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.720 align:middle line:84%
came from the
extra income that's

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
created by the
additional expenditure,

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:84%
by the aggregate demand effect
of additional expenditure

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.110 align:middle line:84%
went to the demand
for foreign goods.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So do the same things we did in
closed economy and just practice

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Increase taxes, do things like
that, increase [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens both
with the equilibrium output.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Qualitatively it will
be exactly the same

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
as you had in closed economy,
except that the effects are

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.267 align:middle line:84%
going to be smaller,
but you're going

00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to get something new, which
is what happens to the trade

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.195 align:middle line:90%
deficit as a result?

00:32:04.195 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
This is a shock we couldn't
do in the closed economy

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:84%
case, which is what happens
if foreign demand comes up?

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
saying, even when

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:84%
it's jubilant in
emerging market world

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because China's
output is going up.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So what are all these
economists thinking and say,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
well, China's
output is going up.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:84%
That means they're going to
import a lot more from us.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:84%
That is, they think
our exports are

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:84%
going to go up because Chinese
consumption is going up.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, exports going up means
that our ZZ curve moves up.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, so then what do you get?

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get now an
increase in exports

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:84%
for any given level
of income means

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that eventually you're going to
get higher output immediately.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But higher output also has a
multiplier, although smaller.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.290 align:middle line:84%
going to get higher
equilibrium output.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.142 align:middle line:90%
So it's great news.

00:33:10.142 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
they're so happy.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.975 align:middle line:84%
It's great news that China is
expanding because that also

00:33:13.975 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:84%
leads to an expansion in
the rest of the world.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, you
know, that if China decides

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
to do an expansionary
fiscal policy,

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:84%
it also expands US
output or more important,

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:90%
for Chilean output.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:90%
It does that.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same--

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Chile could have
done it by having

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
their own fiscal policy that
would also have expanded output.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's wonderful
that China decides

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to do it because that
expands output as well,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:90%
with one advantage--

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
two advantages.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
What is-- but there's one that
you can see here, which is what?

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that they prefer
that China does therefore

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.590 align:middle line:90%
rather than me?

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.215 align:middle line:90%
What looks better here?

00:34:04.215 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Assume that they're
of comparable size

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and so on in terms of the
impact in the top diagram.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you generate the
same increase in output

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.338 align:middle line:84%
as a result of one policy, which
is by domestic expansion in G,

00:34:21.338 --> 00:34:23.130 align:middle line:84%
which is what we did
in the previous slide,

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:84%
or because China
goes into a boom

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and it starts importing a lot?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
That is, we can
export a lot to them.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we get the
same increase in output.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:90%
What looks a little better?

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Not a little better, it
can look a lot better.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:84%
There are two things, but one
is in this diagram, which is,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:84%
remember, if I did
government expenditure,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
the net export function
wouldn't have moved

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up
with higher output.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I would have ended up with
a bigger trade deficit.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's
export-driven,

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:90%
so it's the opposite.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Because now the net export
function is shifting up.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I move Y star
up, I'm moving exports up.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
That means the net
export function

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.180 align:middle line:90%
is moving up, shifting up.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm losing
some of that because

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in increasing domestic
output goes into imports.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, in this case,

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I end up with a trade surplus
rather than a trade deficit.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So lots of-- that's the reason
when you open the world,

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
free riding here.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.467 align:middle line:84%
You want the other one to do the
policies for you because then

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
you're a lot better.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can get the
same increasing output.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But here you end up with a
trade surplus rather than

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.303 align:middle line:90%
a trade deficit.

00:35:42.303 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is a second thing
that I'm not showing you here.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:84%
There is a big difference
between doing it domestically

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.780 align:middle line:84%
by increasing government
expenditure versus the other one

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%
doing it for you and then
pulling you through export.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.850 align:middle line:84%
What else will look better in
the US in this case, relative

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:90%
to the previous slide?

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Do interest affect it?

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALIERO: But
that's too sophisticated.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.938 align:middle line:84%
We're still keeping the
interest rate constant.

00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Aha?

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.100 align:middle line:90%
That's even more sophisticated.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
This is short run,
completely sticky prices.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Forget all that.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:23.700 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Fiscal deficit.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:84%
In the other one, I
need to increase G

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:90%
so I had a fiscal deficit.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Here, I don't need to do that.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in reality,
taxes are typically

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
indexed to output--
domestic output.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So that probably will improve
the deficit in the US.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:90%
So anyways.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The last point I
want to talk about

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.260 align:middle line:84%
is another variable
that we didn't

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:84%
have in the closed
economy, which

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.780 align:middle line:84%
is the role for the exchange
rate, what the exchange rate can

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so for this, we need
to look at, you know,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:84%
the only term that depends
on the exchange rate

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:90%
is this net export term.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the exports minus imports.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So what you know
from net exports,

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:84%
it's very clear what
happens to net exports

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.240 align:middle line:90%
when we increase Y star.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:90%
We did an experiment before.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what increased exports.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So net exports will increase
if you increase Y star.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
net exports will

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
decrease if domestic output goes
up because imports increase.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But from this expression,
it's a little ambiguous

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
what happens to net
exports when there

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is a-- when the real
exchange rate appreciates.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little ambiguous
for the following reason.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The volume expression is clearly
increasing in the real exchange

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.520 align:middle line:84%
If US goods become
more expensive,

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:90%
you want to import more.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what we discussed before.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But the value may not be such
because if you are importing

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.900 align:middle line:84%
those goods in euros and
now the euro is cheaper

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
for you, than you are paying
less for each unit you import.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going
to assume from now

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
on that this second
effect is not

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.680 align:middle line:90%
as strong as the volume effect.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
realistic assumption

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.380 align:middle line:84%
except for the very,
very, very short run.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
be our assumption.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Our assumption will be
that net exports decrease

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:90%
when the currency appreciates.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:84%
If your goods become more
expensive, then on net,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.465 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
less net exports.

00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:90%
That's an assumption.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It simply says that this
guy in the numerator

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:84%
responds more strongly than the
denominator to a depreciation--

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to an appreciation
of the exchange rate.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.823 align:middle line:84%
So the quantities effect
is much more important

00:38:41.823 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:90%
than the price effect.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.908 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not going to have
three questions about this

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume
that from now on.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.040 align:middle line:90%
That's your assumption.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:84%
If I make a mistake and I try to
trick you in the quiz for that,

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.570 align:middle line:90%
you can charge me the points.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't intend to do that.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Just as I did in a spot
when one of the TAs sort of

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
wrote something there.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And because this is a
very realistic assumption.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So now let's see
what happens, then,

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:90%
when the exchange rate moves.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And let me use it.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that you are in a
situation where you want

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
to reduce the trade deficit.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.110 align:middle line:90%
What would you do to--

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:84%
so the experiment I have
here has two components.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the first one.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that your country
has a big trade deficit

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and you want to reduce
that, and the only tool

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:90%
you have is the exchange rate.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.955 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:39:45.955 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Because suppose you have a trade
deficit, you don't like that.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can move the
exchange rate around.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you depreciate.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You make the domestic
goods cheaper relative

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So depreciate your
currency, which

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:84%
is the prices are
completely sticky, fixed.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Then nominal depreciation
means also real depreciation.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And that will
increase net exports.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So what that will do
if you depreciate,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the exchange rate is also a
parameter in this net export

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And given my assumption, when
you depreciate the exchange

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:84%
rate, that then moves the
net export function up.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is that
if you do that, that's also

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.015 align:middle line:84%
going to be
expansionary because now

00:40:41.015 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:84%
you have certain
equilibrium level of output.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And now there's going
to be expenditure

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.583 align:middle line:84%
switching all around the
world towards your goods.

00:40:46.583 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
end up producing more.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And so suppose that you didn't
want that extra production.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You just wanted to fix
your trade balance.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Then you have to set that.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I've done here.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.473 align:middle line:84%
So typically--
that's very typical.

00:41:01.473 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you're in a situation
where you have very large trade

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
deficit, but you're OK with
the equilibrium level of output

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Then a typical package is
you depreciate your currency,

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:84%
but you also reduce
government expenditure.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the depreciation of
the currency is expansionary.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:90%
It's expansionary.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.263 align:middle line:84%
It improves the trade
deficit, but it's also

00:41:19.263 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:84%
expansionary
because you relocate

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:84%
expenditure, both of
residents and foreigners,

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:90%
towards your good.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.360 align:middle line:84%
That increases demand for
your good, increases output.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, if I
don't like that, I

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.120 align:middle line:90%
have many ways of setting that.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.800 align:middle line:84%
One of them is by reducing
government expenditure.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I've done here.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is a great package.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:90%
You see, this is doing--

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:55.090 align:middle line:84%
remember I told you here
that people tend to prefer.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said, this is one
way of increasing output.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:90%
If you want to increase output.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:09.095 align:middle line:84%
And another way is to
do it by exports rising.

00:42:09.095 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:84%
If I don't want to increase
out, but this is better

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because this increases the trade
balance, well, suppose I do--

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
which is what is [INAUDIBLE]
is I do the converse.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Suppose I don't want
to change output,

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:84%
but I want to increase
the net export.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, these two charts,
this and the previous one,

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:90%
tell me exactly how to do it.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I use this for the
expansion of output

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and to improve the net exports.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I use the other one to
offset the effect on output,

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:90%
but with the opposite sign.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I use this, but
with declining G.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I did here.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
tempting for a country

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to do, to depreciate the
currency and at the same time,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.700 align:middle line:84%
if you think that you need
to cool off the economy,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.590 align:middle line:84%
then you can use some
other instrument,

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:90%
domestic instrument to.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, China was
accused of doing just this.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It was called the mercantilist
policies of China.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And especially sort of in late
'90s and 2000s and so on, China

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:20.850 align:middle line:84%
had massive amounts of exports
and the US had a huge trade

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:90%
deficit.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It was called the time
of the global imbalances

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:84%
because big deficits in the
US, big surpluses in China.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
world kept accusing

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
China of really
maintaining their currency

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:84%
at artificially low levels
with the purpose of doing that.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And anyways, I'm not going
to take sides on that.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that--
but the reason why

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.430 align:middle line:84%
the currency, the Chinese
renminbi was so depreciated

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.730 align:middle line:90%
was different from that.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.210 align:middle line:90%
But that's a different story.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:90%
But the result was this.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It was that they had very
large trade surpluses.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the result was this,
that they had very large trade

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.460 align:middle line:90%
surpluses.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And they grew a lot
because they had this.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.310 align:middle line:90%
But it was very export-driven.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the rest of
the world pulling.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact the domestic economy in
China, they were saving a lot.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So domestic consumption
was very low,

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but they had massive
amount of exports,

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's what was
pulling their output up.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So open economy,
you get new tools.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's all that
I want to say for today.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:90%
So summary.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
A very important demand
for domestic goods

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:53.810 align:middle line:84%
is no longer equal to
domestic demand for goods

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:84%
because part of the latter
will go to foreign goods.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, part of the former
will come from foreign demand.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's what is
new of this part.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.575 align:middle line:90%
You have an extra component.

00:45:08.575 --> 00:45:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing that is
new of this part of the course

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.523 align:middle line:84%
is that, well, these extra
components, the exports

00:45:13.523 --> 00:45:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and the imports, are
functions of things

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.900 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have before.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.390 align:middle line:84%
For an output, the exchange
rate, in particular.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So equilibrium output, again,
is determined by a output--

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
domestic output-- equal
to that, not to that.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.100 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The difference
between the two is

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.540 align:middle line:90%
reflected in the trade balance.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So the trade-- another way of
thinking about the trade balance

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is simply the difference between
the demand for a domestic goods

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and the domestic
demand for goods.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So the trade balance
is nothing else

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:90%
than that DD minus the ZZ curve.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the trade balance, OK?

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.070 align:middle line:90%
The ZZ minus the DD curve.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.380 align:middle line:90%
That's net exports.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me write that down here.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So remember that we started
from the demand, which

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:84%
was C plus I plus G. That's
the domestic demand for goods.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:34.910 align:middle line:84%
We went to Z is equal to
demand plus net exports.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is
that net exports is

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
just equal to Z minus Z. So
that's the reason you can--

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.980 align:middle line:84%
very early on when I want to
show you this thing here--

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the distance between ZZ and
DD is this net export here.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
when the two of them

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:10.330 align:middle line:84%
are the same, that also means
that the export is equal to 0.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Very important also, message
from this part of the course

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is that a depreciation
improves the trade balance

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and increases the demand
for domestic goods.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's why it's called
expenditure switching mechanism.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The expenditures-- both
of domestic residents

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and foreigners switches
towards domestic goods.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's also very important.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:84%
For a given exchange
rate, changes

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.110 align:middle line:84%
in aggregate demand in one
large country induced by policy

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.170 align:middle line:90%
or the private sector--

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:90%
in this case, China reopening--

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:48.240 align:middle line:84%
affects other countries through
Y star, through exports.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.087 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to stop here.

00:47:53.087 --> 00:47:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
lecture, what we'll do

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.050 align:middle line:84%
is we'll integrate this
with the financial opening.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.815 align:middle line:84%
And that will get
us to what I think

00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most important
models in this course, which

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Mundell-Fleming model.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:17.000 align:middle line:90%
