RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
I expect that there

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:84%
will be many fun
lectures in the sense

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
discussing a little more exactly

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
at the right time in
which that issue is

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
an important issue, at least
as described in the newspapers.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we are going
through a very interesting time

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:90%
for macroeconomics.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Inflation is unusually high.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Something needs to
be done about that.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And we still have problems
on the supply side

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of the economy as
a result of COVID,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the slow
reopening of China.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have a war
going on, which

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:84%
is affecting also
the price of energy,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and is particularly
impacting Europe.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And all these things, the
situation is very fluid.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
All of them can
change at any moment.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And policymakers are, therefore,
paying very close attention

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
to all these things.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not a normal time.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're a policymaker,
macroeconomist policymaker,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
you are not sleeping
a lot these days.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I expect that we
will have plenty of time

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to discuss interesting
things and analyze them

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
at a slightly higher level
than you can do at this moment.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also told you
in the introduction

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that this particular lecture is
not going to be of that kind.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very
boring in the sense

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that we need to start
with definitions.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, who
likes definitions?

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very boring.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is an
interesting, a curious side

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of the definitions
we're going to discuss,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.067 align:middle line:84%
which is that if you were
taking 1401, microeconomics,

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
many of the concepts
we're going to describe

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:90%
require no definition.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
They're obvious.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I ask for an output
of a factory that produces cars,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty obvious that
it's a number of cars.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:84%
If I ask you for the
prices of those cars,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty obvious what
the price of a car is.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Not so for macro,
because if I ask you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
what is the output of
the US economy, well,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:84%
there's millions of
goods and services

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:90%
are produced at the same time.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So what do we mean by output,
a single measure of output?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if I ask you about the
price level or the inflation,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
the rate at which that
price level is changing.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, what are we talking about?

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to see whether
the price of a car is going up.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we're mixing sort of
millions of different goods

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.948 align:middle line:84%
and services, then
it's a little harder.

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
we need this lecture,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's a little
harder than 1401

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and we need to
define basic things.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
trick because you're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
summing apples and oranges--

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
not only apples and
oranges, apples, oranges,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
health services,
financial services,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:90%
all of them in one piece.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a little trickier.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason we
need this boring lecture.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
We need to go through that
slightly trickier definition

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
of output prices and so on.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So let me start with
the most basic thing--

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:90%
aggregate output.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day when
the economy is in a recession

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
or not, and so we don't
like it or we do like,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
it depends on what is
happening to output.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Is output growing at the
pace it used to grow?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Or is it growing less
or it's declining?

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's very
important for macro

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and to understand the
health of an economy,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the macroeconomic
health of an economy.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But we need to start by
defining what we mean by output.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a
tricky thing to do

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
when you're adding so
many apples, oranges,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
financial services,
entertainment,

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and lots of things that
are very different,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have a good
way of doing that.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the National accounts
as we know them in the US is

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
something that we have since
the post-war period in the late

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
'40s that we developed the
techniques, the approach,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a measure
of aggregate output.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Before that, we had
measures, proxies.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Industrial production
is very high,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're producing lots
of cars, stuff like that.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But something systematic
like we have today

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
is a pretty recent thing.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:90%
OK we call that NIPA--

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
the National Income
and Product Account.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Income and product--
that's going

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to be very important for macro,
as you'll see in a minute.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So the main measure
of aggregate output

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
is what we call gross domestic
product, or simply, GDP.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
You hear GDP, that means
output of an economy.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Why is gross and not net?

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to worry
about that in this course.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:90%
But that's it.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You hear GDP, most macroeconomic
wouldn't say output.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
They would say GDP.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:90%
It's very short.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:90%
It's efficient, and so on.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what it means,
is the output of an economy.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
But how do we define It?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
it's much harder

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
than when you have
an individual good.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I will be, most
of the time, I will say goods.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But really it's
goods and services.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's very long to
say goods and services.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.655 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I say goods, I'm not
trying to play any trick on you.

00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I really mean
goods and services.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I just be lazy.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And most people
are lazy that way.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the difference
between goods and services?

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to worry
a lot about that in this.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to worry at
all about that in this course.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But just to get a sense, goods
are things that are tangible.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Services are things that
are not that tangible.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
They're benefits that you
receive from the tasks

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that someone else
operates on you.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So you go to the Medical Center.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't come up with a
piece of a machine to--

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
well, they may
lend you something.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But you don't come
out with an objective.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You come out with a service
provided by a doctor to you.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And the same happens
if you go to a bank.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't come with
an ATM with you.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But you come up
with is the service

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
of having done a
transaction or deposit

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
or gotten a mortgage
or something like that.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a service.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a restaurant,
again, you don't--

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:90%
what you have is an experience.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It's people provided
an experience to you.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Things are a little tricky
because if you do a take out,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
well, it's not an experience,
or it's really the good.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So, if you get into those
details, which we're not going

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:90%
to get, it gets to be tricky.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But just to get a sense, on
average, a consumer in the US,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of the consumption is
in services, not in goods.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not the bananas
and so on that you buy.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of the financial
services, health services,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and entertainment, and
things like that, traveling.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
That's where you spend
most of your time.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Having clarified that,
you can forget that.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.525 align:middle line:84%
From now on, I'm
going to say goods.

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So occasionally I may
say goods and services.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%
But I always mean the same.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do we measure
these things?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are different
ways of doing this.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
to my slide there.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, there we are.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.133 align:middle line:84%
And so suppose that you have
an economy that is very simple.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to tell you
how simple this economy is.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It has just two firms.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that we have an
economy that is very simple.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It has two firms.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
One firm produces a steel and
the other one produces cars.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And the company
that produces cars

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:84%
buys all the steel
from the company.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
You, as a consumer,
don't buy steel directly.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:90%
The car company buys the steel.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
It uses to produce a car.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And you buy the car.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's our simple economy.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And those are the accounts
of the simple economy.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
So there you have a company.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
One has a revenue from sales.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It sells 100.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So price of steel
times steel is 100.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:35.747 align:middle line:84%
The second company buys steel,
uses workers, and sells 200.

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
So the question I asked
you, the first question I

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:84%
asked you here is, well, what
is the GDP of this economy?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.255 align:middle line:84%
Here you have an economy
that has two goods.

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, a real economy
is a lot more complicated

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
than this.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:90%
But you have two companies.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And I asked you, what is GDP?

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So the obvious things that you
can come up with is, well, I

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:90%
sum all the revenues.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the obvious one.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The total GDP of these
economies is 300.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a sensible answer.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
At least at this
moment, I would accept

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:90%
that as a sensible answer.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:90%
In the quiz, I wouldn't.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:90%
But here it's a sensible answer.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, you
ask me for what

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is the total output
of that economy.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I sum up all the
revenues and sales.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's 300.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, so is it 300, or is it 200?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's another--

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
it says, well, look, only
the final goods perhaps

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
should count because, you
know, this is the only thing

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that you, as a consumer, will
ever see is this part, not that.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Those are two sensible answers.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll show you
in three different ways

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the right answer is
200 for that economy, not 300.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:90%
The right answer is 200.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So method one-- and all
these methods are used,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and they used to check
each other to compute GDP.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So method one is what I
said here is final goods.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You said GDP is the
value of the final goods

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and services produced
in the economy

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
during a given period of time.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Notice that GDP is
a concept of a flow.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
produce in a year.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason you say GDP of
the US in 2022 was $23 trillion.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's in a year.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a period of time.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's one definition.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And one way of making
sense of this definition

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
is imagine that I give you the
same economy with the same two

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:90%
factories.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a
sudden I tell you,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm going
to merge the two companies.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So company, the car company will
buy the steel mill, or whatever.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I now put together
those two accounts,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
now, I never see the
steel because that's all

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:90%
happening inside the factory.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's still the
case that the economy

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:90%
would be producing 200 cars.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And all that you
would see is 200,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
because I would put
this thing together.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a steel that this
company had purchased from that,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
but now it's all inside.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So if I put them
together, then that steel

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
there doesn't appear because
it's all produced in-house.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And now GDP would be 200.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes no sense
that just because I change

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
the ownership structure of the
company, that your GDP changes,

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:90%
collapses from 300 to 200.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
If I'm only measuring
final goods,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
though, I don't
have that problem.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:90%
It's still 200.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter that I have
the merge lies, and lies in 20

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you that
we're going the right way

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.578 align:middle line:84%
here because it's a
very robust answer.

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:84%
That is, you don't count
the intermediate output.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You only count the
final goods, which

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
are the things that
the consumer will buy,

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
the firms will buy
for investment,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind--

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
that foreigners will buy.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Alternative method
is GDP is the sum

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
of value added in the economy
during a given period of time.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:90%
What is value added?

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
the final goods

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
produced by a company and
the intermediate inputs

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
it purchased to
produce those goods.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what is the value added
of the steel company here?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:90%
The answer is there.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
But what is the value of it?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's 100.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:90%
How do I know it's 100?

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it's not
buying any intermediate input

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and the revenue is 100.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
I get 100 there.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.117 align:middle line:90%
OK, 100.

00:12:47.117 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
There is no intermediate inputs.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
What is the value added
of the car company?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the revenue
on sales is 200.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But it purchased 100
intermediate inputs.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So the value added
is 200 minus 100.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The value added of
this company is 100.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
100 plus 100, I
get my 200 again.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.348 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Would we consider the
wages to be intermediate good?

00:13:10.348 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: No.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Those are not goods.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Those are factors of production.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Their machines in that
factory that are helping you

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
produce things, that's a
service of the machine.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It's capital.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
That's not an
intermediate input.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
An intermediate input is
another good or service

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that you buy for the purpose
of producing that good.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So workers, no.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The workers are working
inside your company and so on.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
If the work was
produced, was outsourced

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and you had another company
that produces something

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.918 align:middle line:84%
that you use from
those workers, that

00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:90%
would be an intermediate input.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.877 align:middle line:84%
But you would have to count the
value added of the companies you

00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%
have outsourced to.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's method two.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And you see we get exactly 200.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.518 align:middle line:84%
Those two methods are
called production methods.

00:14:00.518 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
There are different
ways of measuring

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:90%
the production of the economy.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The third method,
and the last one,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is an income
method, which means,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
look, all that is produced
has to be earned by someone--

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
the workers, the
owners of capital.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to own that.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
If the firms sell
collectively $200, those $200

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:90%
have to be allocated to someone.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Someone means
workers, the owners

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
of capital of the firms,
or in realistic economies,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:90%
the government.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
You pay taxes and
things of that kind.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.622 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're not going to
worry about the government

00:14:36.622 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's an alternative
method, is method three.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You just sum the incomes.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So who are the
factors of production

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:90%
here related to your question?

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
In this, there is no
government here, no taxes.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have only workers and
profits and the capital,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:90%
the owners of the company.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Wages is 80 plus 70, is 150.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Profits is 20 plus 30, 50.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
150 in wages plus 15 profit
gives you back your 200.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so those are the three ways
we have of measuring things.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And you see, they give you
exactly the same result. Now,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
there is something, as I
say, from the construction

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
of national accounts, there is
something interesting in what

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I just said, which is,
look, that production

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:90%
is the same as income.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be very
important for macro--

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
very important for macro.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally
unimportant for micro.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at a
company, for example, in micro,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at a
car company by itself,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
it is true that the
output of that company

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
becomes income, part for
the owners of the company

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and part for the workers.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But that income needs
not be spent in cars.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Can be spent in food and
entertainment and whatever.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.963 align:middle line:90%
Not so in macro.

00:15:57.963 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Because what else are
you going to spend

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
it to than in the same
good that you're producing

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:90%
in the aggregate good?

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a very distinctive
feature of macro

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that is not present in
micro, is that the income has

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to be spent in the same goods.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
If the economy is
closed, later on,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to open the economy
to the rest of the world.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.053 align:middle line:84%
And then you buy some Chinese
goods and blah blah, blah.

00:16:18.053 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep it close, hey,
you are not going to buy cars.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what you work on.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.967 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to have to buy it

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
in the single good
of the economy, which

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is a sum of all the goods
that we consume in average.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be very important.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, this time this stuff
moving in the right direction.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's, that.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Now you know what GDP is and
the different ways of measuring.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
remember that for p set one

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and for quiz 1.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And you might as well
forget it for the future.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It's good that you
understand the concept,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's different
ways of constructing

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:90%
that's not important.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Second thing we
need to worry about

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever you're thinking
about the output of an economy,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
you're really trying to
think about the real output,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
meaning the number of cars and
number of machines and so on.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But you have
inflation, for example.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Then the prices of these
things are growing.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
And so the total revenue
on sales is growing.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:90%
But they don't mean the same.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.217 align:middle line:84%
And we want to certainly
separate these two things.

00:17:20.217 --> 00:17:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
we have a concept

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
which is called nominal
GDP and another one

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:90%
which is called real GDP.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Nominal GDP is the
simplest thing on Earth.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially we have only
one final goods company there

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:90%
which was carved out.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you have
cars, refrigerators,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:90%
many, many things.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Nominal GDP is simply the
sum of the final goods

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and you multiply them
by the current price.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.393 align:middle line:84%
And that gives you the
dollar GDP that you have.

00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
is in the US today.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You could check it, but it's $24
trillion or something like that.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:84%
P times Q, prices
times quantity.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And you sum across all
the final goods, as we do.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
That's one way of
calculating things.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:90%
That's nominal GDP.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.583 align:middle line:84%
But again, what we
really care about is

00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
we're going to care
a lot about later on

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
is how that economy
is doing over time.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it growing?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it not growing?

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Nominal GDP can grow for
two different reasons.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It can grow because
the economy is really

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:90%
becoming more productive.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's producing more goods, or
because prices are going up.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.677 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this moment, nominal GDP
is growing very fast in the US,

00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that we may
have a recession this year.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But nobody has any doubt that
nominal GDP will grow because we

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:90%
have lots of inflation.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to
separate these two things.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that removes
the inflation component

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
is what we call real GDP.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And real GDP is you
hear the word only GDP.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was produced by
somebody who understand

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
what he's talking about.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:90%
GDP really means real GDP.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Just hear GDP, people
are trying to say

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:90%
the output of the economy.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's real GDP.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And the real GDP is computed--

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:90%
many tricks.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But essentially what you
do is you also sum across

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
all the goods.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You also sum across the goods,
but you use constant prices, not

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the prices of that point
in time necessarily.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you
a very concrete example.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But before doing
that, for this course,

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
we're going to call nominal
GDP and all nominal variables

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:90%
are going to have.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what the textbook does.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
a dollar sign in front.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's nominal GDP.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
GDP is going to be y
without the dollar.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:90%
That's real GDP.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
For the first part of the
course up to quiz one,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to worry very
little about nominal things

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to have
prices completely fixed.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But you still need
to know the concept.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's real GDP.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So now let me give
you an example.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.345 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have this, this
simple economy we had before.

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
look at final goods

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because as we need to
look at to construct GDP.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this economy produces
cars, and supposedly produces

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
10 cars in 2011, 12 cars in
2012, and 13 cars in 2013.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But suppose the price of a car
is what you see there, 20,000,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:90%
24,000, and 26,000.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.405 align:middle line:84%
Nominal GDP is simply the
product of this times that.

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:90%
That gives you $200,000.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
12 cars times $35,000
gives you 288 and so on.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
That's nominal GDP.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Real GDP, you have to pick
which price you want to use.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:90%
But only use one.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:90%
And don't vary it over time.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
case we picked 2012.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So that means when you say GDP,
real GDP at 2012, base 2012,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
were 2012 prices, means you're
using the prices of 2012.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:90%
You don't vary that.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You let quantities
change over time.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:90%
But the prices remain fixed.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, real GDP at
2012 is, 10 cars times 25,000.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:90%
That gives you 240,000.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:90%
12 cars times 24,000, 288.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
For this year, nominal GDP
is the same as real GDP.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:90%
An accident?

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.742 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.742 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because you used the
base year as the [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:90%
We're using that as a base year.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So nominal GDP will always
be equal to real GDP

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
at the base year.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the year we're
picking as the base

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
because those are the
prices we're using.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I got about 2013.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, is not 26,000 times 13.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Is 24,000 times 13.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So we get 312.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's obvious
here that real GDP is

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:90%
growing less than nominal GDP.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, because this
economy has inflation.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Prices are rising
over time and we

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
want to remove that when we
look at the real concept.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The real concept removes
the price effect.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
There are times
in which you don't

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
want to remove all
that price effect.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And it happens a lot, for
example, in computers.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes the increase
in the price of the computer

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is simply because the
computer is better

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and you want to correct
for quality and so on.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's not
something you need

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.955 align:middle line:90%
to worry about in this course.

00:22:37.955 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you
are deciding the pace

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:90%
at which you want me to move.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm really puzzled
by this stuff.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.290 align:middle line:90%
This is from the book.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And you see what happened in the
US, with nominal and real GDP,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:90%
with base year 2012.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before,
these two curves,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
one is nominal
GDP, the red line.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:90%
The blue line is real GDP.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:90%
We're using base year 2012.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, they
have to be the same.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
very clearly there

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the blue line, real GDP,
is flatter than the red line.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.846 align:middle line:90%
Why is the-- yeah.

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:25.728 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Real GDP before was
lower beacuse [INAUDIBLE] GDP--

00:23:25.728 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean this particular market
probably [INAUDIBLE] inflation.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
This inflation.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I do have
a reference for you.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:90%
So ask me after the--

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, so yeah, in the
US, between 1960 and 2018,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
nominal GDP increased by a
factor of 38, while real GDP

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
by a factor of 5.7.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So you better be
careful when you

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
look at GDP that you are
removing inflation, especially--

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were
to look in Argentina,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
these guys have had a
recession, a chronic recession

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
for a long time, big recession.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But nominal GDP is exploding
because they have 10,000%

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:90%
inflation.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a big difference,
especially over time.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
This is just so you get the
picture, the complete picture

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:90%
for the US.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This is GDP growth in the US
since we have national accounts.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And some noticeable things--
well, again, recessions.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:90%
This was a big recession.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we call this the
Great Recession, big recession.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is COVID.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And then this is 2020.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they bounce back in
2021 when we reopen the economy.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Big growth.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
But that's very anomalous.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
very weird shock.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But see, these are all the
shaded areas are recessions.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Recessions are defined as
slightly more complicated way

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But one sort of popular
way of describing recession

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
is as an episode where you
have two consecutive quarters

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:90%
of negative inflation.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That's not the formal
definition of a recession,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's pretty close.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
you have there.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Another concept is
unemployment rate--

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.290 align:middle line:90%
the unemployment rate.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's GDP.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
part of the course,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
we want to worry
a lot about that.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to build a model
on how to find equilibrium GDP.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see what
happens with fiscal policy,

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
with monetary policy,
how does equilibrium

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
GDP, macroeconomic
output, changes

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
with different forms of
policies or when consumers

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.875 align:middle line:90%
get scared or stuff like that.

00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.397 align:middle line:84%
What about the
unemployment rate?

00:25:40.397 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The unemployment
rate is not something

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
we want to worry a lot
about until the second part

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of the course, after quiz 1.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But still, I want to get it
over with these definitions.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
So what is employment?

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a number of
people who have a job.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment is slightly less
easy because it's first of all,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
obviously to be unemployed,
you cannot have a job.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not enough that
you don't have a job.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
An unemployed person is
somebody that doesn't have a job

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
and is looking for one.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And not all unemployed
people look for a job.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Not all non-employed people
are looking for jobs.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So to be unemployed, you
need to not have a job

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and be looking for one.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
The labor force, what
we call the labor force,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is the sum of those two groups,
the employed and the unemployed

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:90%
that would like to get a job.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.878 align:middle line:84%
The unemployment rate,
which is something

00:26:44.878 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I showed you in the
previous lecture,

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
is just a ratio of these
two concepts, the unemployed

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:90%
over the labor force.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Notice, over the labor force,
not population, the labor force,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
which is the sum
of the employed,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and those that are unemployed
that do not have a job

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and are looking for a job.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And how is unemployment
measured in the US?

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly a survey.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And I have the info there.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It's called the CPS, the
Current Population Survey that

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:90%
consults lots of households.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And they ask them about
the employment status,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.057 align:middle line:84%
whether they have been looking
for a job over the last two

00:27:24.057 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:90%
weeks or not and so on.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way we
come up with the number.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, those
that do not have a job

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:84%
but are not looking
for a job, they

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
haven't been looking for a
job in the last two weeks,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
are called not in
the labor force.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what we say.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, these concepts are
between unemployed and not

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:84%
in the labor force
is not that clear.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.762 align:middle line:84%
We look at the
unemployment rate.

00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But we also tend to
look at those people,

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
as well, because many people
are simply discouraged.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
They would like to
get a job, but they

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
have been looking for a while
and they haven't found it.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And it happens that there is
a lot more discouraged workers

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:90%
during recessions.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.233 align:middle line:84%
And you're having
a big recession.

00:28:05.233 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to find a job.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's very easy
to get discouraged.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason we
look at broader measures of non

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
employment than the
typical unemployment rate,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.730 align:middle line:90%
because a lot of those--

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:90%
not in the labor force.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
People do not have a job and
are not looking for a job,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:90%
are really discouraged.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They just gave up after a while.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.538 align:middle line:84%
The participation
rate-- and that's

00:28:27.538 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
a very important concept--
is something you would

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:90%
have ignored most of the time.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very critical
at this moment.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The participation
rate is the ratio

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of the labor force to the total
population of working age.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And you exclude people in
prison and stuff like that.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But so it's labor
force, which is

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the sum of the employed
and unemployed,

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
divided by those that
could work in principle.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the participation rate.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:90%
How do these numbers look?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I showed you this picture
in the previous lecture.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
unemployment rate.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It skyrocketed during COVID,
but it has declined enormously.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in the
previous lecture,

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.020 align:middle line:84%
a big issue is that
the unemployment rate

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:90%
today is extremely low.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen levels like
this since the early '60s.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment rate today
is at record low levels.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's a problem.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Sounds wonderful.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.782 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a problem because
we have an inflation problem.

00:29:31.782 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And those two things
are connected,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
as you will learn
later on in the course.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
we have right now.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the unemployment rate.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that
employment rate is so low,

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:90%
there are two reasons, really.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
One is that there was lots of
stimulus policy, fiscal policy,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:90%
monetary policy.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So aggregate demand
and consumers

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
were fed up with being locked
out of restaurants and trips

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and so on for two years,
decided to travel and so on.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And they had lots of savings.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The US consumer accumulated
excess savings of $2.7 trillion.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
spending the stuff.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:84%
China, a big reason why
people expect a big bounce

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
back is because they
also had a lot of savings

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
because they were locked
up for quite some time.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of that, there
is lots of demand for goods.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn in
the next lecture,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that means lots of
output, as well.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But the second reason
is the following.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:90%
It's the participation rate.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
People haven't come back
to work in the magnitude

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.570 align:middle line:90%
that we expected.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's the participation
rate in the US.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the participation rate
is labor force over all those

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that could work, in principle.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you think is this?

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Look at the participation rate
used to be in the '60s, below

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:90%
'60s.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a big
rise in the participation

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:90%
rate in the US.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.287 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is this due to?

00:31:06.287 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Women
joining the workforce.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Women
joining the workforce.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what it did.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's that.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Since then, since this woman
did all that they had to do,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:90%
we have been declining.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's an issue.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:90%
But look at what happened here.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.105 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people exit the
labor force during COVID.

00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, they had
to take care of the kids

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and/or the elderly.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so people withdrew
from the labor force.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want a job.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.190 align:middle line:90%
It was also discouraging.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult
to get a job.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you work
in a restaurant.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It was impossible to get
a job in a restaurant.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But everyone expected this to
recover to the previous level

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and it hasn't.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So you see that the
participation rate has not come

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:90%
back to the levels pre-COVID.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It's substantially below.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons, you

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:84%
know, that restaurants complain
that they don't have workers

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so forth, is that
many people haven't come back

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:90%
to the labor force.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:84%
We thought this was
going to be temporary.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a concern that a
lot of that is really permanent.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
People that decided that life at
home wasn't that bad after all.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Less income, but they spend more
time with the kids or whatever.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's an issue.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big reason behind
the low unemployment rate.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we
have all this inflation

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:90%
has to do with everyone.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:84%
In particular, the Fed
miscalculated the bounce back

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
of the participation rate.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before,
we're not going

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at labor market
issues until the second part

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.840 align:middle line:90%
of the course, after quiz one.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:90%
And the same is for inflation.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.112 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to look
at inflation issues

00:32:56.112 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
until the second part of the
course because to connect them,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.617 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they are connected.

00:33:02.617 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
look at labor markets

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.285 align:middle line:84%
until sort of eight
lectures from now or so.

00:33:08.285 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is an important
variable and certainly something

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:84%
you're facing every single
day in the newspapers

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on-- the inflation rate.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So by inflation, when
you hear inflation,

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that typically means
the sustained rise

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.223 align:middle line:90%
in the general level of prices.

00:33:23.223 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
the price of cars

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.762 align:middle line:84%
went up relative to the price
of hotels, or now down relative

00:33:27.762 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:90%
to the price of hotels.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
It's that on average,
prices are rising.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
call an inflation.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call
the price level BT.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are many different
price levels, as you see.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So the inflation rate, when
you hear the inflation rate,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is the rate of change
of that price level.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.938 align:middle line:84%
An episode of
deflation, the opposite

00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
of what we're
experiencing now, where

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing inflation,
is when that inflation rate

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:90%
is negative.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Japan most prominently has
experienced something like that

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:84%
not now, but experienced it for
on and off for the last three

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:90%
decades or so.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.842 align:middle line:90%
And so what is the price level?

00:34:11.842 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
of defining it.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
different price levels.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:84%
A very popular one is what
is called the GDP deflator,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's the one you see.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It's never mentioned
in the newspapers.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But we economists tend
to look at the deflator.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The deflator is nothing else
than the ratio of nominal GDP

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:90%
to real GDP.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Another one is far more popular
and more relevant for you as

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
consumers, is what we call
the consumer price index.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the CPI.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:90%
The CPI, that's what it is.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So you calculate the rate
of inflation from the CPI.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:90%
You calculate the same way.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But you use a CPI there
instead of the GDP deflator.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.442 align:middle line:90%
Now, it turns out that--

00:34:55.442 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:90%
obviously confused with this.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that these
two measures are sort of

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:90%
pretty well aligned.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
There are differences
that may be

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.360 align:middle line:84%
interesting at some
specific point in time.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But they tell you more
or less the same picture.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
In particular, there
is absolutely no doubt

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that we have an inflation
problem these days.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You can be as selective as
you want with the price index

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:84%
you want to use and people
are getting very selective.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Now we have CPI excluding--

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing that
makes a lot of sense

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.860 align:middle line:84%
is to exclude the
most volatile goods.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So typically, the
CPI, we use is called

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Core CPI, which removes
energy and food, which

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:90%
are very volatile prices.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.885 align:middle line:84%
You don't want the thing to
be moving all over the place.

00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But now we're also
beginning to remove shelter

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.580 align:middle line:84%
because shelter inflation is
very high and sticky and so on.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So people can get to
be very selective.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how you look at
the thing, we have a problem.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:90%
There is no way around that.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.027 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way we look.

00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're not
going to look-- we're

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
going to talk a lot about
this problem, of course.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:90%
But we need to build tools.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.782 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get there in
about nine lectures from now.

00:36:00.782 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Nine lectures from
now, we're going

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to be able to talk about
what is going on with models.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can talk whenever
you want, but with models,

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.837 align:middle line:84%
OK, so those are the concepts
I wanted to discuss today.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
definitions, some relief

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:90%
that we got over this stuff.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Let me just show you, because
we have five minutes or so,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.900 align:middle line:84%
equivalent numbers for other
places around the world.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:90%
That's China.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:90%
That's China.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.838 align:middle line:90%
That's GDP growth for China.

00:36:30.838 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
things that you

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
can see for this GDP series.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
The first is that
it was very high.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.627 align:middle line:84%
These numbers look
a lot on average.

00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:40.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot higher than the US.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.240 align:middle line:84%
When I showed you the
US, the rate of growth

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.630 align:middle line:84%
was moving around 2%, 1.5%,
blah, blah, blah, occasionally

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:90%
recessions and so on.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:90%
This is China.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Look, you had numbers
like 10% or so.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We want to know why is that
you can have so much difference

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.175 align:middle line:90%
in different countries.

00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to do

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.910 align:middle line:90%
in the third part of the course.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
growth, we're going

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to look at these kind of
factors, what can give you

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:90%
sustained rate of growth?

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Sustain, I mean, for
a long period of time

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:90%
higher than in another country.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The main factor, just to
preview what will happen,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
is simply that China was
a lot poorer than the US

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you're poorer and
you put your act together,

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
you can grow a lot
faster than the rest.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Now China is slowing down.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Aside from COVID, it's very
clear for quite some time

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that they have been worried
because clearly GDP growth is

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:90%
declining.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're
terrified about that.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And many of the things that
are happening with China

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
the fear associated

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to a slowdown in
the rate of growth

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
when they are still quite
poor in per capita terms.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what happens in
China has to do with that.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Japan, look at Japan.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Japan also grew very
fast in the '60s.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You see this very
fast rate of growth.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Then it began to slow down.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And boom, here it collapsed.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They have a massive crash in
financial markets, equities

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and land.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The price of land was enormous
in Japan at this time.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.567 align:middle line:90%
They had a big financial bubble.

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:32.900 align:middle line:84%
For those of you that know
Japan-- or if you don't know,

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The imperial park
in Tokyo, which

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:84%
is a park that is much smaller
than Central Park or whatever,

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:84%
the value of that land
at some point in time

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:84%
was the same as the value of
the entire state of California.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:90%
That's an order of magnitude.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It was not for sale.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, in terms
of location, times, price.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.090 align:middle line:90%
But that bubble crash.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And since then, Japan has never
been able to recover its mojo.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It has been sort of
growing at a very low rate

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.460 align:middle line:90%
for a very long period of time.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that scares China

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:90%
is that this may happen to them.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this happened
to Japan when

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:90%
they were already quite rich.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Japan was pretty poor
after the war, naturally.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And they grew very
fast in the '60s.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But then they had this issue,
financial bubble and so on.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They crashed and had never
been able to recover.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And China is worried that
this slowdown happens to them

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.540 align:middle line:84%
before they have reached the
level of income per capita

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that Japan reached
when that happened.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960 align:middle line:84%
There are common factors
behind the two of them,

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.380 align:middle line:90%
as well-- demographic factors.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Demographics are very
negative for both of them,

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.480 align:middle line:84%
which naturally will slow
down the rate of growth.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
at that later on.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.150 align:middle line:90%
This is inflation in Japan.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You see, most countries had
high inflation around there

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:84%
because the price of oil, we had
massive oil shocks and so on.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So inflation was pretty high.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But the problem of Japan
has been the opposite.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Since the bubble crash in the
late '80s, early '90s, they have

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:84%
had very low inflation,
even deflation.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's been a big problem.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason why
they have had so low growth

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is because they have been
in this deflationary trap.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And then something you will look
at later on in the course, when

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
you have deflation,
it's very difficult

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to use monetary policy to
get out of a recession.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason they
keep getting stuck there.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's all I wanted
to say for today.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.907 align:middle line:84%
And I'm relieved again that
this lecture is behind us.

00:40:37.907 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:84%
In the next lecture, we're going
to introduce the first model.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at is how
to determine equilibrium GDP

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and how that depends on a
variety of things, including

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:90%
fiscal policy--

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.950 align:middle line:84%
not monetary policy,
that will happen later--

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
but how scared you are,
consumers' preferences

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:90%
and fears and so on.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's the plan.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So unless there are any
questions about this--

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you next Monday.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:90%
