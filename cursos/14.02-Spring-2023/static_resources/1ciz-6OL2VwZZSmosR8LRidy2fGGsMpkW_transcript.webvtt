RICARDO CABALLERO:
So remember what

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
has been happening
to the US economy.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
As economy-- and it
happens similarly

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
with a few lags and
leads and differences

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
in sizes but around the
world, in most economies

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world, as the economy
began to reopen from COVID,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
we had a situation where we
had too much demand for supply.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The potential output,
using the terminology

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
you have in the
IS-LM-PC model, it

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
was slow in picking
up because we still

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
had lots of bottlenecks
in the supply chains,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and in different
sectors of the economy,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
some people didn't want to
come back to work, to the labor

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:90%
force for a while and so on.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So the supply side was
very still impaired.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Not as impaired as in the
middle of the COVID in 2020,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
say, but it's still
impaired, while demand

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
was very strong because people
were fed up of staying at home.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
They had saved a lot
during the COVID recession

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted to spend.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And there had been
lots of fiscal support

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and monetary policy
support and so on,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
so people feel
wealthy and felt rich

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and so they wanted to spend.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a big demand,
but supply is not there.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
That starts introducing
inflationary pressures.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Say we have a negative
output-- a positive output gap,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
output above potential output.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
That puts immediate
inflationary pressure.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what we learned from the
Phillips curve and all that.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And now for a while,
the Fed did not

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
want to react to this because
they thought that this was going

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to be mostly a temporary
phenomenon, that supply would

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
recover pretty rapidly,
and that people would,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
after taking one
trip, well, they

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't want to
take a second one.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal support was
winding down and so on,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
so they thought
this would go away,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want
to cool off the economy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:84%
because they thought they didn't
want to fight a temporary fight.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Now as a result of new
shocks, the war and things

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
like that, but also that the
initial call was not right,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
was incorrect, that there was
a lot of inertia in demand

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and that pick-up in demand
lasted a lot longer than they

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
expected.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Is that inflation
really began to rise,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Fed was really caught
what is called behind the curve.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:90%
They should have started--

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
at least exposed, it's
easy to see it that way.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Remember what you have.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
situation where output

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
is above potential
output, the interest rate

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be rising.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed is supposed to be
increasing the interest rate,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't for a while.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Assuming that the
forces that were

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
bringing potential output down
and demand up were transitory.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
When they discovered
that wasn't the case,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%
they had to start catching up.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, they began
to hike interest rates very,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
very rapidly.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Unusually rapidly for
an economy like the US.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There are many reasons
why policymakers,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
especially monetary
policy makers,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
prefer to be gradualist, meaning
to move things in small steps

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
rather than in one big bang,
especially in the way up.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
It is to cut rates, they're
very willing to be very

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:90%
aggressive in cutting rates.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But raising rates
is something they

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
tend to be reluctant to
do very, very rapidly.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main reasons
they are reluctant to do that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
very rapidly is
because something

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.957 align:middle line:84%
may break in the
process, and there

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that are
very important if it breaks.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
There are certain other
things that are not

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:90%
very important if they break.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that is
very important if they break

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
is banks.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's typically
where you run into trouble

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
when there is episodes of
very fast hikes in rates.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, because the US
banking sector, especially

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
the large banks,
were very resilient,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.508 align:middle line:84%
they had lots of
capital and so on, there

00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a lot of concern that
that would be an issue in the US

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
because, again, the big
banks looked very healthy.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
Deposits were flowing
out of big banks,

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
but it was happening
all at a normal pace.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It's normal that deposits go
out of the banking sector when

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
interest rates start to rise.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
sign of any trouble.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that changed a month
ago, as you well know,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and something broke finally.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
The major episode there was
the Silicon Valley Bank.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We saw a big bank run there and
eventually that bank collapsed.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And since then,
things have looked

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:90%
a little more complicated.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So here you have, for example,
commercial bank deposits.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
As I said, as the
Fed began to hike--

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
so focus on the red line.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
The Fed began to hike rates,
then deposits began to-- people

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
began to move their money
out of deposits into US

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
treasuries, money market
funds, things of that kind.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
But that was normal.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't
lead to a big cut

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
in lending, which
is what you worry

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:90%
about when banks lose funding.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But things began to change
quite rapidly, well,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:90%
in the second half of 2022.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
This was felt mostly
by large banks.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And when deposits decline
gradually in large banks,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
that's not such a big issue
because deposits are not

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the only funding source
that big banks have.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They have many other
sources of funding.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But then that's what
happens this year.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.588 align:middle line:84%
Things accelerated very,
very quickly this year.

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And so this is different.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
animal from this sort

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
of very controlled
decline in deposits

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:90%
as interest rates were hiking.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a very sharp
decline in deposits.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's a problem because that
unavoidably will hit lending.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to show up in
terms of the models we have had.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
If you were to use
your IS-LM-PC model,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
it would show up as
an increase in x.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.035 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we had risk
premium and stuff like that.

00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way
you probably could model

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:90%
what is happening right now.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, one of the--

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
as I said before, these
are in different scales.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So small bank deposits
on the left, large bank

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:90%
deposits on the right.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, through most
of these episodes in which

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
deposits were declining
in the banking sector,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
it was mostly a phenomenon
that affected large banks,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and it was very gradual.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But what happened since a
month ago is essentially small

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and medium sized banks
experienced a very large run

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in deposits.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Part of that went to money
market US treasuries and part

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of it-- you don't see
different scales and so on,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
but it went actually
to large banks.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It was relocation.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:90%
That's called flight to quality.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now even if this has been a
full relocation of deposits

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:90%
from large banks--

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
from small banks to
large banks, and so no

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
deposit would have declined in
the whole banking sector, that

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
would have consequences
for the economy

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
because these type
of banks don't lend

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to the same type of people.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Small banks, small,
especially regional banks,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
lend a lot to people that--
to businesses and people

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that do not have other
sources of funding.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be small
businesses and so on.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The only way they can borrow
is either from the family

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:90%
or from a bank.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But they cannot issue bonds
and things like that, no?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't have
other sources of funding.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a problem because
what you see here is naturally

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
when you start seeing deposits
going out, there have been also

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
losses experienced by
the banks because they

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
had to recognize the
losses in the asset side

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
once they lost deposit is
that they had to cut lending.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here what has
been happening to lending.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Large banks, they began
to slow down here,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
but it's a gradual slow down.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But you have seen a very
sharp decline in lending

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
over the last three
or four weeks.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the early phases
of what we like to call,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:90%
as described as a credit crunch.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a problem,
as I said before,

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
because those banks, these
banks, the banks in gray here,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:84%
are the banks that
lend primarily

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
to small and medium
sized businesses.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So you see here the share of
commercial and industrial loans

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:90%
by bank size.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is loans
to small businesses,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:90%
loan to larger businesses.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
These are the banks that are
in grave or below $250 billion,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and you see that they have
a large share of loans

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:90%
to small businesses.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So those sectors are
going to suffer a lot.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be a
contraction in the economy,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be very concentrated

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
on small businesses, medium
sized businesses, and so on.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
more problematic,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
a contraction in lending
to those businesses

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.042 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
alternative sources of funding.

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's either return earnings, the
family is really, really small,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
or banks.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, big corporations,
these guys,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
probably are borrowing
from 10 different banks

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and they have issued
corporate bonds

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and they even have
commercial paper.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
This is entirely different
life when you live here

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.145 align:middle line:90%
and when you live here.

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
If you look by
sectors, that also

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
implications for sectors.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
clearly contractionary,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to be
equally contractionary.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It will depend on the
composition of your sectors.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Not all sectors have the same
share of small businesses

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and medium sized businesses.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
You see here the construction
service has a very large share.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
More than half of the
businesses in construction

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
are really small or
medium sized businesses.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Big contrast with
utilities where they are

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:90%
all big businesses and so on.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So big dispersion,
and so this is

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
going to be a contraction that
is going to be very felt--

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is felt very strongly
here at the top.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's what is
happening right now.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And from the point of
view of the aggregate,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
essentially where we
have gone is from a path

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:90%
like this to a path like that.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.628 align:middle line:84%
So the economy was
overheating, so we needed

00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:90%
to slow down the economy.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no way around that.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Output was above
potential output.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That was causing
inflationary pressure.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
We needed to bring
this stuff down,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and the economy
was slowing down.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But it was happening
at a very slow pace.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was a bit
exasperating for the Fed,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
but it was happening
very, very slowly.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Among other things,
because the balance

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
sheets of the household sector
and corporations in general

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%
was very healthy.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But now things are
accelerating very quickly

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
because once you introduce
credit crunch, credit

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
constraints, and
things like that,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
the same declines in wealth that
we were experiencing before that

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
were driving aggregate demand
down have a much larger effect.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we're changing
from a world that

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
looked like that to
a world that's going

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:90%
to look a lot more like this.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tricky
for the central bank

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:90%
because now the Fed needs to--

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:90%
before there was no way around.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
They had to hike interest rate,
because the main problem was

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:90%
inflation.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Now they know that as they
hike interest rate-- they still

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
need to hike interest
rate, I think,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
unless there is a big mess,
because inflation is still

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:90%
way above their target.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But they have to be very
worried that this stuff doesn't

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
become too steep.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Things get to be very non-linear
when the financial sector is

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.312 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:06.815 align:middle line:84%
And so probably that means that
on net, they already did it.

00:12:06.815 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
In the previous
meeting, everyone

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
anticipated 50 basis
points of hikes.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Once SVB happened, the
bets went down dramatically

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and the realization went
down to 25 basis points.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And so that's where we are now.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Now if everything
works as planned--

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and more or less that's a
forecast at this moment.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any panic and so on.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that we're going to
experience not a technically

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
a recession, but a significant
slowdown in the next quarter

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.462 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:40.462 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of the
consensus expecting

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to see as a result of all
these combined forces.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
A Fed that still
needs to tighten

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
because of aggregate demand
reasons and the very negative

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
effect of the credit
crunch, especially

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
in certain parts of the economy.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If everything, again, works as
planned means things continue

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to go fairly smoothly,
then it's certainly not

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be a good year
for economic activity

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
but it shouldn't be
a disaster either.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of where we are at.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And the tension is, well,
if the financial crisis

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
leaks into the larger
banks, then these numbers

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to get a
lot worse, of course.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
concern at the moment.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't seem like
the central scenario.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
also some good news

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
happening because remember
that the problem we had--

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the problem we have
comes from two sides.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
One side is too much
demand, and that the Fed

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:90%
can affect very quickly.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's doing
by hiking interest rates.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Not as quickly as
they would like,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
but still, they have
an impact on that.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But the other problem
was aggregate supply.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.425 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, it's that the
labor market looked very tight.

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And remember when we did
the Phillips curve and all

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that, the labor market
is very critical in all

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the process of generating
inflation and so on.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason you try to
generate more unemployment,

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
essentially to lower wage
pressure, because that

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
means less pressure on prices
and so on and so forth.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
is that, again,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is very nice in principle, that
we have very low unemployment

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's very difficult
to lower wage pressure

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:90%
if unemployment is so low.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Having said this-- and
this is the part that I say

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:90%
is fairly good news.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Having said this, in the
model we simplify things

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and we just put unemployment
as the only variable

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that could adjust and that
was important for wages

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:90%
aside from some institutional.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Things in practice, there
are many other indicators.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And really what really
matters is employment.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
we took a fixed n,

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.245 align:middle line:84%
we took a fixed the
participation rate,

00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason
unemployment was the variable

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
to summarize everything.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But what really puts
pressure on labor market

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.518 align:middle line:90%
is shortage of workers.

00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have an unemployment
rate that is constant

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:84%
but there are lots of workers
coming into the labor force,

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
then that doesn't put as
much pressure on wages,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and therefore less
pressure on inflation.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what we're beginning

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to see in the US economy, and
I think that's very good news.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It gives us hope that this
inflationary process may

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
come down a little faster.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is labor
market participation.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So this unemployment
number spiked a lot,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but it underrepresented
how much contraction there

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
was in labor, in
employment, and so on,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
because many people simply
exit the labor force and those,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
remember, we don't
count as unemployed OK?

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And so that happened.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a very sharp
decline in the labor force,

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in the labor participation
rate, so the decline

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:90%
in the labor force.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And then that recovery
is one of the things

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:84%
that happened much slower
than the Fed anticipated.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the mistake is
they thought that this was going

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
to come back quickly and that
for potential output was going

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to rise very quickly,
and it didn't.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the mistakes,
the forecast mistakes.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But now it's clearly
that it's coming back

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to levels that are
more consistent

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
with historical levels.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the employment
to population ratio,

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:84%
also a big decline
for similar reasons.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at employment
to population ratio today,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
it's clearly getting back
to the trend it had before.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's very good
news in the sense

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that even if unemployment
doesn't move a lot,

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.515 align:middle line:90%
this reduces--

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:90%
well, it's good for output.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
It expands and so on.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But it also lowers inflationary
pressures in the economy.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And another component
actually that I

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
think I mentioned a couple
of times in the lecture

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:90%
is immigration.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
In a market like the US,
a lot of the labor forces

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%
comes from immigration.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And that stopped for a while
for a variety of reasons,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:84%
but certainly COVID
had a big effect.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So that meant about 500,000 less
people a year coming into the US

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
labor force, and
that has big impacts,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
especially in some
sectors of the economy.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
And that's clearly
been fixed now.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:17.645 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
We may have other problems.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
People may fight for political
reasons and these things

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, but from the
point of view of macro,

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
this is certainly helping.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look at where
the wage pressure is really

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
coming from in the US economy,
it's coming from those sectors

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
where immigrants
play a big role.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Accommodation, food
services, stuff like that,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
you see that their sort of
wages rose pretty dramatically

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because there was a massive
shortage there for two reasons.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
One, people didn't want to go
back to those sectors to work,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
close contact and
stuff like that.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
that the important flow

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of supply of workers
into that had slowed down

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:90%
quite dramatically.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we're at.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
all these good forces,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.665 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that we
have very low unemployment,

00:18:09.665 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
wage pressure is

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:90%
beginning to decline in the US.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was very high
there, but those numbers

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
are very distorted by
composition effects and stuff

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.783 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:19.783 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But these were the numbers
that were very worrisome.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with wage
inflation of 6%,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very difficult
to bring inflation to 2% down.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
You need much lower
wage inflation.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But you see that is
beginning to decline.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:84%
2% is still too high
for a steady state

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.393 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go back
to 2% inflation rate

00:18:38.393 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:84%
because you can have an
increase in real wage,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.935 align:middle line:84%
but that has to be more or less
aligned with the rate of growth

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
of productivity.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Which is much lower than that.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at best it's
1%, 1 and 1/2 sometimes.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So you could live with 3.5%
real nominal wage growth, but 4,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:90%
4 and 1/2 is a bit too much.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.605 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so that's the
state of the economy.

00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Any questions about the
state of the economy?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.428 align:middle line:90%
Open question.

00:19:07.428 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You're happy with it?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Doing fine?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do next is
so this was a summary and all

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that I did here I did
close economy economics.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.918 align:middle line:84%
All my description,
I didn't need

00:19:23.918 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to tell you what was happening
in the rest of the world

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That would have
been a lot harder

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.147 align:middle line:84%
to do if this was Singapore,
for example, because Singapore

00:19:32.147 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
depends a lot on the
rest of the world

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's very difficult
to tell a story

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that just depends on what
happens in Singapore.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The US is pretty unique in that
you can tell most of the story

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:90%
based on what happens in the US.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Most.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Not all, but most of the story.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I just did.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Almost anywhere else,
you need to think about--

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
even if you're in Japan.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Big economy and so on.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.057 align:middle line:90%
Effects will play a big role.

00:19:54.057 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when you describe
the state of the economy,

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
talking about the yen.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Very high, very low, or not.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Here you don't worry
much about the dollar.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:90%
The US is very unique on that.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I think no other country in
the world has that feature.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to
open up the economy,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and again, perhaps it's the
least important for the US

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but anywhere else it's
tremendously important.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
More so it's
becoming increasingly

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.165 align:middle line:90%
important for the US.

00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It has been becoming
increasingly

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:90%
important in the US.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the middle
of a deglobalization mess.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:90%
We shall see where we end up.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So there has been a bit of a
reversion of a very strong trend

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
towards integrating the
economies of the world

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:90%
through many different channels.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.238 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to talk about
what are the key variables when

00:20:43.238 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
you integrate an economy
to the rest of the world

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
with some definitions.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What are variables
that we're going

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.635 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about that we
weren't talking about up to now?

00:20:55.635 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that's going

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to be very important in an open
economy is the exchange rate.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.858 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:00.858 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And here I'm giving you--

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to define things
very formally later on,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but here you see an
example of the US dollar

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.020 align:middle line:84%
vis a vis the main
trading partners.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
The US trades with many
different parts of the world,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's bilateral
effects between those things.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And this measure
here is something

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that weights by
the amount of trade

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that we have with different
economies of the world,

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
trades the different
effects and says, well,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.058 align:middle line:84%
is the dollar strong,
weak, or whatever.

00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:30.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a matter of convention.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
There's many ways you can--

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:84%
no, there are two ways
in which you can do it,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to do
it the following way.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
What these effects
will reflect is

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
the price of the domestic
currency in foreign currency

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
terms.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So that means when this
goes up, means the dollar

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:90%
was becoming very expensive.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very sharp--

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll get back to it, but we
call that an appreciation

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:90%
of the currency.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So here the dollar was becoming
very expensive in terms

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:90%
of other currencies.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
The opposite happens starting
the second half of 2022.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.823 align:middle line:84%
Now we have had some cycles
here during this year.

00:22:12.823 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be a very
important variable, the effects.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We call it the effects,
the exchange rate.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Another variable that
we haven't talked about

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
but that is going to
be important here is--

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and that politicians
argue a lot about it

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
with the wrong
arguments, but they do,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
is the trade balance
of goods and services.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Of goods and services.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So this, the trade balance
of goods and services,

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:84%
is simply the difference
between the exports,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
so what a country sells
to the rest of the world,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:90%
versus its import.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:84%
That is how much it buys
from the rest of the world.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is monthly
data for the US.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The US nowadays
of runs a deficit,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
a trade balance deficit of the
order of $70 billion a month.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
That means exports to the rest
of the world about $70 billion

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:90%
less than it imports.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:90%
70 less than it imports.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
You have seen that this is
pretty sustained, actually.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Here it looks pretty balanced,
but the US, on average,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
has a situation like that.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The US tends to export
less than it imports,

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and then that's when politicians
get all very worked out.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They say, this is
unfair competition

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the world
and so on and so forth.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I think in general, it has
very little to do with that.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
fact that the US likes

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to save less than the
rest of the world.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But let me not get into that
until much later in the course.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's the
situation for the US.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
This is obviously a blip that
has to do with COVID and so on,

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
but you see that
we're now more or less

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
back to where we were before.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
This was a period,
actually, of lots

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
of global political tensions
because it had one counterpart

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
that was very big.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:90%
It was China.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The time of the global
imbalances in the US

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
was learning very
large trade deficit,

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and then China in particular
was running very large trade

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
surpluses, and so there were
lots of political quarrels

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So obviously the US has
many, many trading partners,

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and with respect
to many of them,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
it has very large deficits.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:90%
So on net.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:90%
And here are the main--

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I ranked the 10 main
deficits for the US.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know when was this.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, it looks like that
for the last eight or so years.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Remove COVID, it looks more or
less like this all the time.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And you see that the US,
indeed, large exports to China,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
about $153 billion a year, and
it imports about $536 billion

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:90%
a year.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So the net deficit is
$380 billion a year.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason this
is a big political thing.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like a big deficit.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:90%
But there are other countries.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
With respect to Mexico,
$130 billion, and so on.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The US exports a
lot more to Mexico.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Vietnam.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what
happens from Vietnam

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
is really Chinese
exports in disguise.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:90%
But there you see it.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:90%
There are many others.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Germany is always
a problem, but--

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:84%
a problem for somebody that sees
deficits as a problem and so on.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Now that's on the good side.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:84%
What I was saying here is
that one sense of openness

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is in the goods and
services market.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So you buy goods from
the rest of the world,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the world
buys goods from you.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these
things are balanced,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.505 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they are not.

00:26:20.505 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
When at the
aggregate level, they

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
are not balanced for a
very long period of time,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
unless you're the US, that
often causes problems.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the bilateral level,
if you look at any country,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:90%
we'll have situations like this.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Some countries where they
export a lot to and import very

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:90%
little from and vice versa.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way the US looks.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Another sense of openness,
which is very important

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
is financial openness.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you
can also buy or save

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
using foreign assets
or domestic assets.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can buy foreign
assets-- perhaps not

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.390 align:middle line:84%
you directly or most
of you directly,

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
but you can do it through
a broker and so on.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You can buy foreign
assets, and foreigners

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:90%
buy lots of US assets.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a sense of openness
in financial markets,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:90%
that you can buy--

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you're not stuck with your
country's financial assets.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You can also invest in other
countries' financial assets

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Those things probably you as--

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know this
trade openness a lot

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.362 align:middle line:84%
more probably than
financial openness

00:27:29.362 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're all the time
buying imported goods and stuff

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.025 align:middle line:84%
like that, while
you're probably not

00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:84%
involved in a lot
of transactions

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of international financial
instruments and so on.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.230 align:middle line:90%
But they are very large.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So pension funds
and so on, they're

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
all involved in very
large transactions.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, transactions
in financial markets

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
are an order of magnitude
larger than transactions

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Very large.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And here you have an example
by origin, the foreign holdings

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:90%
of US assets.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is in billions.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.485 align:middle line:90%
So these guys here--

00:28:10.485 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
this, China and Canada have
the largest, and the UK,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
those have on the order
of $2 trillion of US

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.505 align:middle line:84%
assets they're holding
Japan should be here also.

00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there it is.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Now in these two
countries here, a lot

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:90%
of those holdings actually--

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
well, particularly in
China more than in Japan.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In China it's a little
less than Japan.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Japan, they save
a lot so they need

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to buy lots of financial
assets and the US

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is the main producer of
financial assets in the world.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:90%
They save a lot on that.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But also the central bank,
because of currency intervention

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and so on, buys lots
of US treasuries.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
China, this is mostly
the central bank

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
buying US treasuries,
foreign reserves,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:90%
large amounts of reserves.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Canada is private sector,
pension funds and so on,

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But you see, Brazilians also
buy lots of assets from the US.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, central banks play
big roles in all this.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Australia is less a central
bank, much more private sector.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
UK is all private
sector, and so on.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:90%
And in Europe.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But the point of that
picture is that there

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.215 align:middle line:84%
are lots of countries
in the world

00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
or residents of different
countries in the world

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that buy US financial
assets and in big amounts.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
total number today is.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Probably-- eh.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let me not
make up that number.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:90%
You may find it.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But it is certainly
in the $20 trillion

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that of assets held--

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.740 align:middle line:90%
US assets held by foreigners.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:90%
You can check it and tell me.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It's probably more.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Here's the other way around.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.895 align:middle line:84%
US residents holdings
of foreign assets.

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:13.395 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:24.273 align:middle line:84%
You see, US residents hold lots
of Canadian assets and mostly

00:30:24.273 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
developed economies,
but there you

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:90%
have India, China, and so on.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Lots of Latin American
assets and so on.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So the US-- so it's not only
that the rest of the world

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:84%
demands US assets,
but US residents--

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:84%
perhaps not directly,
most of you,

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
but indirectly demand
lots of foreign assets.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
There are some very
fascinating facts

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that happen here because
the type of assets

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that foreigners tend
to demand from the US

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%
are very different from
the ones the US demands

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
the things that--

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the reasons the US can afford
running those chronic trade

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
deficits is because it tends
to get much higher returns

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
on the assets it buys
abroad than foreigners

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
get on the assets
they buy in the US.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:25.250 align:middle line:84%
The difference allows you to
fund systematic trade deficits.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
is a lot of the US assets

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
that foreigners buy, they
do it for safety reasons.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
They are buying US treasuries,
very safe instruments.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Just in case there
is a big mess,

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
they want to have those
assets, so it's almost

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:90%
for insurance reason.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The US treasuries are sort of
perceived as a main safe assets

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:90%
So they hold it for that reason.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
While the US mostly holds assets
abroad for risky investments.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Either foreign direct investment
or equity, stuff like that.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And typically most fixed
income investors in the US--

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what you see
here is just US residents

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:90%
reaching for yield.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Brazilian sovereign bonds, the
equivalent of the US treasuries

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:90%
give you 9%, 10%.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot higher than
the US tends to give.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.430 align:middle line:90%
14% even now, and so on.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So on net, the US
tends to make--

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:84%
has less assets in
the rest of the world

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
than foreigners have
of the US and it still

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
makes sufficiently more return,
higher return on average

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
on an asset it holds on
the rest of the world

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that it has a surplus which it
can finance the trade deficit.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
This is complicated.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.068 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know the details,

00:32:48.068 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
but just to tell you what the
kind of things are happening.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's three senses in
which you can have openness.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
The two that have described
implicitly already, goods.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.910 align:middle line:84%
In goods market you
can buy foreign goods

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and you can sell goods
to the rest of the world.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.898 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is financial markets,

00:33:11.898 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:90%
which is what I just described.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You can choose between
domestic and foreign assets.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
The main impediments
to the former

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
typically are
tariffs and quotas,

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and you have heard a lot about
tariffs and so on these days.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The main impediments
for financial markets

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
is what is called
capital controls.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Very rarely developed economies
impose capital controls,

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
but emerging markets
do it regularly.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Limit the amount of--
especially capital outflows.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:84%
When lots of capital
is live in the country,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.760 align:middle line:84%
they try to stop you
from doing more of that.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes
do it in the way

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:84%
in because they want to avoid
the macro instability that

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from the big
reversal of capital flows,

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
so they don't let
lots of capital flow

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in during the boom just to
prevent a reversal later on.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Thus capital controls.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
third way of opening

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the world,
which is factor markets.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Which is that firms
can choose location.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, some plants--

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing Japanese plants
that do not export Toyotas

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:90%
directly from Japan.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
They have the plant here either
in Canada or somewhere in the US

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and they sell locally.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's relocation of
factors of production.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
Japanese capital that relocates
to some place in Canada

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:90%
or in the US, and labor.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:84%
You can also have workers
that move from one place

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.850 align:middle line:90%
That's another form of openness.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:90%
Free factor mobility.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:84%
In this part of the course we're
not going to talk about this.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.797 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
focus on these two.

00:34:56.797 --> 00:34:58.380 align:middle line:84%
The first model we're
going to look at

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.172 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a model
of the goods market,

00:35:00.172 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be
very much like the IS-LM

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:90%
but with an open economy.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
bring in interest rates,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.178 align:middle line:90%
but now once you--

00:35:12.178 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
remember what we did in
the closed economy first?

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.678 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the
goods market, then

00:35:15.678 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:84%
we look at interest
rate determination.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:90%
That was our LM.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we put the things
together, we came up with IS-LM.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Here the tricky thing is
that there is not only

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.300 align:middle line:90%
one interest rate.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:90%
There are really two.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.695 align:middle line:84%
You have to decide
between the domestic

00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and the foreign interest
rate, and then there

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is an exchange rate in between
which will also affect.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
it's going to get

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
a little more complicated,
because you're

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be having two different
prices, two different goods you

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:90%
can buy.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have also two
different assets you can buy.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And the effects is going
to affect all those things.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I say effects,
I mean the exchange rate.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Foreign exchange.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
sometimes it's called FX.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing that happens
is that because economies

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.280 align:middle line:84%
are so integrated in goods
and financial markets is

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:90%
that business cycles tend to--

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
especially large
ones tend to be very

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:90%
synchronized around the world.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:90%
You see here emerging markets.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:90%
This is the world.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
That's emerging markets and
that's advanced economies.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:84%
You can see the kind of things
we discussed in the growth

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:84%
section, which is
these countries tend

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to grow faster than
these countries

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:90%
because they're catching up.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
they're called emerging.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But the level of the
business cycle, they're

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:39.830 align:middle line:90%
very synchronized.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's 2008, 2009.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The recession was a
recession globally.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:84%
This one doesn't have COVID,
but, well, COVID very naturally

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:52.700 align:middle line:84%
was very synchronized
around the world.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The point I'm making here is
that once you're very integrated

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.157 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the world,
you're also exposed

00:36:58.157 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:90%
to a new source of shocks.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It may help you
in many instances,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
but you're also exposed
to things that come

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is
that business cycles

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:90%
are very synchronized.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
the rest of the world

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
to be immune to a US
recession, for example.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for
the US to be immune

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.915 align:middle line:90%
to an Argentinian recession.

00:37:18.915 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a different story.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But when things
are large, involve

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:84%
the large economies,
typically that

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.430 align:middle line:84%
will leak into the
rest of the world.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:84%
China has changed a little
bit the composition.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:84%
It used to be the case that
that was always the case.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:38.274 align:middle line:84%
If the US sank,
then everyone sank.

00:37:38.274 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And now you have China, which
stabilizes-- it's different.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not completely
correlated with the US,

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and so that has been
stabilizing, actually,

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
for many especially commodity
producing economies and so on.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's still the case.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Big mess is a big
mess everywhere.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:84%
If the economists
were closed, there

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.553 align:middle line:84%
would be no reason unless you
have some exogenous shock.

00:37:58.553 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:84%
COVID, even if the economies
were completely closed,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:84%
would have been a mess because
as long as the virus is spread,

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:90%
then it's a mess regardless.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case here.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This recession was caused by
a financial shock in the US.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And still, the global economy
as a whole suffer a lot.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So things become very
synchronized because of that.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that has been
happening is that everywhere--

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:84%
again, we shall see where we
end up after this COVID things.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a slight
reversion of that.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But everywhere, even the
US, which is one of the

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:90%
closed economies in the world--

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
one of the closed of the
significant economies,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
there has been a sort of--
there was a steady trend rise

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.312 align:middle line:84%
towards higher integration
to the rest of the world.

00:38:47.312 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And the same is happening
in financial markets.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
This is just an order
of money larger.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But you see here in the US, you
see that imports and exports

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as a share of GDP, they
were both rising over time.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Here shows you what
I showed you before,

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:84%
which is the deficit, chronic
deficit that the US has had.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But still, even exports have
been rising for a while.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Now this number here, you
know that about 20% of the US

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:84%
produced goods of 15% of GDP,
The US has about 15% of GDP

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.470 align:middle line:90%
in imports and in exports.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people use that,
the sum, for example,

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
of imports plus exports over
GDP as a measure of openness,

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.060 align:middle line:90%
how open is an economy.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK for comparisons,
but it's clearly underestimated

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:90%
how open economies really are.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many of the goods
that are considered--

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that the US does not import
are produced domestically

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
so they don't count as part
of imports or anything.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Their price is really determined
by international competition.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:84%
The price of a Ford
is very different with

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:90%
foreign competition than not.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So we don't count the
Fords produced here

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:07.282 align:middle line:84%
as imports or anything and it
was part of the non-tradable.

00:40:07.282 --> 00:40:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Not non-tradable.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't part of this
measure of openness.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear that the
price and even the quality

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.645 align:middle line:84%
is being affected by exposure
to international competition.

00:40:17.645 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are very few sectors
that are not really exposed

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to international competition.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, haircuts.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're not going to--

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:32.980 align:middle line:84%
unless you live in some
county at the border of Canada

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and there is a town
right on the other side,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.520 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to happen.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So trend is upward,
and even more so

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.060 align:middle line:90%
than those numbers suggest.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:84%
If you look across
the world, here

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.800 align:middle line:90%
is what I showed you before--

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
what I said before is that the
US actually certainly looks

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:90%
very close relative to others.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.580 align:middle line:84%
If you look across
large economies, Japan,

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
which is also very closed
economy for a variety

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:10.020 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, it's still more open
than the US, UK, little Chile

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.145 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.145 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing that this shows,
this dimension here shows

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:20.558 align:middle line:84%
is that the smaller you are, the
more open you're likely to be.

00:41:20.558 --> 00:41:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to
produce all the goods

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:90%
if you have a small country.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's a pattern.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The smaller you are, controlling
for a variety of factors,

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.580 align:middle line:90%
you tend to be more open.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You need to import
and export more.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Import more, in particular.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, that pattern
is disrupted when

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:90%
you look in this direction, no?

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So all these countries,
which are clearly

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
much larger than Chile in
terms of GDP and so on,

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.865 align:middle line:90%
have very high export ratios.

00:42:02.865 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's the case?

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.380 align:middle line:90%


00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Europe.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.585 align:middle line:90%
They are in Europe.

00:42:14.585 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Europe is very special.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Europe as a whole is
as closed as the US.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
whole area together.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But there is lots of
intra-Europe exports

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and imports, especially
in the Eurozone.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.931 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have lots of things
that have the same currency.

00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It's right next door.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So they're very open, but
they're very open within Europe,

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:44.230 align:middle line:84%
not so much with the
rest of the world

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't differentiate
intra-Europe exports and imports

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.470 align:middle line:90%
versus total.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason you see these
numbers are very, very large.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But even here, within here, you
see that the smaller countries

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.880 align:middle line:90%
tend to be very open.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Much more open than
bigger countries.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.450 align:middle line:90%
So as I said, so terminology.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.600 align:middle line:84%
This picture looks very similar
to the picture I showed you

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:90%
earlier on, but it's not.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:84%
There it was a trade
weighted dollar,

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and here it's just one
particular bilateral exchange,

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the dollar-yen
exchange rate.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.380 align:middle line:84%
What happens is when
the dollar appreciates,

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
typically it appreciates
against everything and so on.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.672 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason the
pictures look very similar.

00:43:32.672 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:90%
But this was pretty dramatic.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.960 align:middle line:84%
There was a very sharp
appreciation of the dollar--

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.080 align:middle line:90%
well, strike what I said.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, this is the pattern
of the number of yen's per

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:90%
dollar's.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.562 align:middle line:84%
Meaning we decided
that that's the way

00:43:49.562 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
define exchange this

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
the price of the
domestic currency

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.570 align:middle line:90%
in terms of foreign currency.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So the price of the
US dollar goes up

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:01.220 align:middle line:84%
when they pay you
more yen's per dollar.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And it went up very rapidly
from close to 100 to 150.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.690 align:middle line:90%
That was massive.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
There were massive
interventions here

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:84%
because it was clear that this
was getting totally out of hand.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, so that was--

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And we say in this case--

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:84%
so when a currency
gains in value,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.577 align:middle line:84%
we call that, in terms
of other currencies--

00:44:22.577 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:84%
there's no sense of a
currency gaining value

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.333 align:middle line:90%
in terms of nothing.

00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It has to be in terms
of other currency.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what an exchange rate is.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So we say that the
currency is appreciating.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, it's a
nominal exchange rate,

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.080 align:middle line:90%
so it's dollars per dollar.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:84%
When the dollar
is going up here,

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
we say the dollar is
appreciating relative

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to the Japanese yen.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:84%
That means the dollar is
becoming more expensive.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.400 align:middle line:84%
They have to give you
more gains per dollar.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.070 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it from
the point of view of Japan,

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and then the picture would
look the other way around

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and it says in
this same picture,

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that the Japanese
yen is depreciating relative

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.010 align:middle line:90%
to the US dollar.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So depreciation is when
your currency loses value.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.055 align:middle line:84%
Appreciation is when your
currency gains value.

00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if I tell you--

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.260 align:middle line:84%
unless you more or less know the
prices in the different places,

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.210 align:middle line:84%
if I tell you that
the Japanese--

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the US buys 130 Japanese
yen, you can tell me--

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and then I ask you, where
would you like to buy your car?

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I assume that the car
is the same quality.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:90%
No transport costs and so on.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, look,
the Japanese yen is--

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.457 align:middle line:84%
for each dollar you get
120, 130 Japanese yen.

00:45:43.457 --> 00:45:44.915 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want
to buy your cars?

00:45:44.915 --> 00:45:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the right answer.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:50.210 align:middle line:90%
You have no clue.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:53.400 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't tell you anything.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The nominal exchange
it tells you

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the relative value
of currencies,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:84%
but to make the decision
of where you buy your car,

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
you need to know which
car is more expensive.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:07.070 align:middle line:84%
That's not enough to know the
exchange, the nominal exchange.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to know what is the
price of the car in each place

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.450 align:middle line:90%
in its own currency.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to use the
exchange rate to translate them

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.680 align:middle line:90%
into some common currency.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Suppose I tell you now
that the price of--

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I do the opposite experiment.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, the price of the
same car in Japan is a 150,000

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:90%
yens.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, there you all have lots
of zeros, but a 150,000 yens,

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.845 align:middle line:90%
and in the US is 1,500.

00:46:39.845 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a used car.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:90%
$1,500.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I ask you a question.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want
to buy your car?

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.832 align:middle line:84%
You can't answer either because
you don't know how to compare.

00:46:50.832 --> 00:46:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Unless I give you the
nominal exchange as well,

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:56.480 align:middle line:84%
you don't know how to compare
those 150,000 yens versus

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:90%
the $1,500.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.370 align:middle line:90%
So you need both.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And that concept
that captures both

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is what is called the
real exchange rate.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.040 align:middle line:84%
The real exchange is
the sign for that,

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to capture where are you going
to do your imports and exports.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a relative price of
two not currencies but goods.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
real exchange is.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the price of domestic
goods relative to foreign goods.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:26.680 align:middle line:84%
How many Japanese cars you
give me for one car, US car?

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the real
exchange rate, which

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:84%
is different from the
nominal exchange rate.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.255 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's related to the
nominal exchange rate.

00:47:33.255 --> 00:47:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It happens that
in practice a lot

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of the volatility
of that price is

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the volatility
of the nominal exchange rate.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Let me end this.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:41.900 align:middle line:90%
With this, I will stop.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So let me call epsilon
the real exchange rate.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me see how we're going to
get to that expression here.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So we want to compare here is
the relative value of two goods,

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's what will matter
for my consumption decision

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.260 align:middle line:90%
or my purchase decision.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we're
talking about this car,

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.905 align:middle line:84%
and suppose I know that the
price of the car in the US is p.

00:48:05.905 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to
compare it with--

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:84%
well, do I buy it here
or do I buy it in Japan?

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
For that, I'm going to
have to compare them

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.580 align:middle line:90%
in the same currency.

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to
translate my US dollar

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
price to Japanese
dollar-- to yen pricing.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:27.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So say that I'm going
to have simple numbers

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.660 align:middle line:90%
and they want there.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So price of the car in
the US costs $10,000.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that for each
dollar you get 10 yens.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Then $10,000 times 10, that
means it's 100,000 yens.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I buy the car in the
US, I pay 100,000 yens.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And so now-- ah, sorry.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.990 align:middle line:84%
This was not Japan
in this example.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the UK.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, the same story.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's even simpler.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It's say then the car
in the US cost $10,000.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Each dollar buys $0.80
or $0.80 of pounds,

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.970 align:middle line:90%
so that means 8,000 pounds.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:90%
So the US car cost 8,000 pounds.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Now compare it with a car in
the UK, say, the same car,

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.445 align:middle line:84%
and the ratio of
these two things

00:49:20.445 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
real exchange rate.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's the price of
the domestic good times

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.430 align:middle line:84%
the exchange rate divided
by the foreign price,

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:32.186 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
real exchange rate.

00:49:32.186 --> 00:49:37.880 align:middle line:84%
If the price of the car in the
UK was $9,000 and I could buy

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.765 align:middle line:84%
the car in the US for $8,000, I
would probably buy it in the US.

00:49:40.765 --> 00:49:42.140 align:middle line:84%
In practice, there
are difference

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.922 align:middle line:90%
between the two currencies.

00:49:43.922 --> 00:49:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of thing
that the real exchange means

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:90%
is the relative price of goods.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But the way to go
from that is you

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:84%
have to multiply the nominal
exchange rate times the price,

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.640 align:middle line:84%
because that converts it into
the same currency as the price.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And then you can compare them.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's stop here.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.073 align:middle line:84%
We're going to continue talking
about open economy next week.

00:50:07.073 --> 00:50:08.490 align:middle line:84%
On Wednesday, what
I'm going to do

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is a review of
IS-LM-PC and growth.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:27.000 align:middle line:90%
