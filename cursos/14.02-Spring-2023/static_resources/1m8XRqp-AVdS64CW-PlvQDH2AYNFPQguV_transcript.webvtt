00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
So today I'm going

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the Phillips
curve and inflation.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Now as I said in the
previous lecture,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the material that is
specific to this lecture

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:90%
will not enter this quiz.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning of what is
perhaps the most important model

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll see in this class,
but it will take us

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
three or four
lectures to develop.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say things
that certainly will--

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
may help you understand
a little better

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
the previous lecture,
so if you're only

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the
next quiz, there

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
will be a sort of small review
of the previous lecture here.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, anything that
is specific to this lecture

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and was not in the previous
one won't be part of this quiz.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So what is this Phillips curve?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1958, an economist at
LSE, London School of Economics,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
came out with just an
empirical relationship.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
This is AW Phillips found
that using historical data

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for the US, I think he did,
there was a negative relation up

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:90%
to the '50s, I think.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a negative
relationship

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
between the unemployment rate
and the rate of inflation.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then our very own Paul
Samuelson and Robert Solow

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
labeled this relationship
the Phillips curve

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
in honor of AW Phillips.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, it is a central
concept in macroeconomics,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly
very, very relevant

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is
going on right now,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
not only in the US
economy, but in most

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
economies around the world.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you this is not
the one that Phillips plotted.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the one that
Samuelson and Solow plotted.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
For data from between
1900 and 1960 for the US,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
you find this
negative correlation.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's reasonable,
this negative correlation

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
between the unemployment
rate and inflation rate, no?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
At very low levels
of unemployment,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you typically see very
high levels of inflation.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, very high
levels of unemployment,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
you tend to see low levels of
inflation or even deflation.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this period includes
the Great Depression,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's the data.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was just
an empirical regularity.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But we can build some theory
about this relationship using

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the ingredients-- most
of the ingredients that--

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, essentially we
can build a relationship

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that is downward sloping from
the ingredients we already have.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part that
is a little bit of a review

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:90%
of the previous lecture.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Remember that we had a--

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
actually, the
previous two lectures.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
We had a wage setting equation,
W equal expected prices,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and then a decreasing
function of unemployment

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and an increasing function of
this labor market supporting

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
institutions, or workers
supporting institutions.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Institutional
variables, I should say.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a price
setting equation, which

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
was simply the wage marked up.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
m is a positive constant.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:90%
So let me start from these two.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.002 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to do
is derive a Phillips curve.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was only an
empirical relationship.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
even with theory, we

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
knew by the time of
Samuelson and Solow

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
we could come up with a
theory of that relationship.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And that theory builds
on the ingredients

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
we have been looking at.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So these are the wage
setting equation,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:90%
the price setting equation.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
simplify things and assume

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
that this relationship here,
this function, F of u z,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
is some linear function,
at least locally

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
linear function, which is
decreasing in unemployment

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and increasing in z.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Why is it decreasing
in unemployment?

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This says no, that if
unemployment goes up

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
for any given expected
price, wage demand is lower.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially because
for the worker, it's sort of--

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
becoming unemployed
is a scary situation.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Conversely for firms, it's
easier to find a worker and--

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
so we say a worker is
scared for two reasons.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
One is that it's more
likely that he gets fired

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
when unemployment is high.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Typically, that's a recession.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's also like--
that worker knows

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that if she were to fall
into the unemployment pool,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
it will take a longer
time to get out of it.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And the firms are seeing
the opposite side.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy for
them to replace a worker

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
if they were to
dismiss a worker,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
because there's lots
of available workers

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
in unemployment.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
that's negative.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stick this
function back in here.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to replace
this W with this function

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
in there in the price
setting equation,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and I end up with
an equation for P.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So this says that the price,
given the expected price,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:84%
is decreasing unemployment,
and increasing in z,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and increasing in the markup.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So again, why is this price
decreasing in unemployment?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the part that is
review of the previous lecture.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.603 align:middle line:90%
Previous two lectures.

00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Because
when wages go down,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.108 align:middle line:84%
and then factors of
production are achieved.

00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: OK, perfect.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Because wages go
down, since our firm

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
needs one worker to
produce one unit of a good,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
then the cost of production of
one unit goes down with the wage

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the
price goes down.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the firm is asking for a
constant markup over that wage,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the wage declines,
and the price drops.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's all review.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So this equation,
you have seen just

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
without an explicit
functional form here.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.798 align:middle line:84%
What I want to do
is to go from here--

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
this is still not
the Phillips curve.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Phillips curve was
a relationship between inflation

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
and unemployment.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have a relationship
between the price level

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and unemployment.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So we want to take
one derivative higher.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.452 align:middle line:84%
We want to go to relationship
between inflation

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%
and unemployment.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Inflation is the rate
of change of P, no?

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not the level of P.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So to do that, all
that we'll do is-- so

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:84%
this, when I don't
have a subscript here,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean the price at time t,
And this is the expected price

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%
for next period.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:90%
But today, for the next period.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to do, I'm
going to divide both sides

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:90%
by P minus 1.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
By that, I mean the price
in the previous period.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
So both sides.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to divide this side
by P minus 1 and this one

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:90%
by P minus 1.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:90%
So I get that expression.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the same
equation we had before.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
All that I did is I
divided by P minus 1.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Remember what this means.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So if this is the
price for January 2023,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
this is the price for--
say, what, we're using

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:90%
annual data for January 2022?

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm dividing by the price
of January 2022 both sides.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Now notice that-- remember
that P over P minus 1

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 1 plus
the inflation rate.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember where
inflation rate is just

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
P minus P minus
1 over P minus 1.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
straightforward algebra, no?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember our definition
of inflation.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
That's P minus--
that's inflation.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:90%
So 1 plus pi is just P minus--

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:90%
over P minus 1.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you have there.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I can do the same for
expected inflation.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Notice that sometimes,
people get confused.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But expected inflation
is equal to P expected,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:90%
not minus P expected minus 1.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's P minus 1.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
P minus 1.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm not
subtracting the expectation

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
here is because at time
t, which is when you're

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
forming that
expectation, you already

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
know what happened at t minus 1.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason this
is expected inflation.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to put
expectations in here.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's pi e.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And so what we get is
I can replace this guy

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
here for 1 plus pi, this
guy here for 1 plus pi e,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and I get the
following relationship.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.963 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
All that I've done
is substituting

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:90%
this for that, that for that.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's our price setting
equation now expressed

00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of inflation rates
and expected inflation rate.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're not
in Argentina, we're

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:84%
in the US, expected
inflation are small numbers.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And the log of 1
plus a small number

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
is approximately that number.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use this
approximation, which,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:90%
again, is valid for x small.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.415 align:middle line:84%
And so I can replace this 1 plus
pi for pi and this 1 plus pi

00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
e for pi e, this 1
plus m for m plus,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and this term here, if these
numbers are not too large,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
again, plus minus
alpha u plus z.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I do all that and I end
up with this expression.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
All I've done is I
took logs of these.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So I get log of 1 plus pi
equal to log of 1 plus pi e

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
plus log of 1 plus m plus log
of 1 minus alpha u plus alpha z.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying if pi, pi
e, m, alpha u, plus z

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
are not very large numbers,
which we will assume,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
then this is
approximately right.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So I can rewrite that expression
as that, approximately.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I should have put
in approximately.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.242 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we have
something that looks

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.538 align:middle line:84%
a lot more like the
empirical relationship we

00:11:26.538 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:90%
were talking about.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
We have a relationship between
inflation and unemployment.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So this says that for any given
expected inflation, and markups,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and labor market institutions,
higher unemployment

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:90%
means lower inflation.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.175 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:11:43.175 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So that curve tells you, that's
the negative relationship

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
we wanted, no?

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It says, higher unemployment,
lower inflation.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Look, you heard it very clear
when we talk about this, no?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You understood very clearly
why an increase in unemployment

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:90%
lowered the wage.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
You understood very
clearly why, therefore,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
an increase in unemployment
lowered the price.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done anything but
algebra in the two steps.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So the same economics behind the
explanations that you had before

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:90%
apply to this curve here.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So the reason
inflation will be lower

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
when unemployment is
higher, given all the rest,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
is because it will be
less wage pressure.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Workers will demand lower wages.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
That means lower prices,
and therefore inflation

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:90%
will be lower.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The economics doesn't
change at all.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I only divided both sides by
P minus 1 and I took the logs

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and I approximated it.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So the economics
has not changed.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I just did a little
bit of basic math.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.433 align:middle line:84%
So all-- what I'm trying to
say is all the intuitions

00:12:58.433 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that you can
already-- you already

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
had from the wage setting,
price setting equation

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and so on, you can apply to
the Phillips curve as well.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So now we have something that,
in principle, could explain

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
the type of relationship
that Phillips found and then

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Samuelson-Solow corroborated
with extended data.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.993 align:middle line:84%
How do we get to something that
looks like what these people run

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
as a regression?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they ran a
regression essentially,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
or they correlated
inflation with unemployment.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And they found a downward
sloping relationship.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at what happens here.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that we assume that
the expected inflation is

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:90%
equal to some constant.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
In economics, we say
when that's the case,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and especially if
pi is a low number,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
inflation expectations
are well anchored,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.653 align:middle line:84%
meaning any single year, there
can be a price of oil is high,

00:14:07.653 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
or something happens
and inflation

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:90%
will deviate from that.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But people are all the time
expecting for inflation

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to go back to what
is a normal level.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, or at least a
few years ago, in the US,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the normal level
was around 2%, say.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So people say, well, this
year inflation was 1.8%,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
but we expect next year 2%.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.353 align:middle line:84%
The next year, we got
surprises on the upside.

00:14:33.353 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Price of food went
up, or something like

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that, we got inflation of 2.3%.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But you ask people how much
you expect for next year

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, 2%.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what a model of
expectation like this means.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It's that you're always
expecting something which

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
is some historical
value and that we

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
have agreed is a reasonable
level for our economy

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So you see that if I
replace expected inflation

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
for a constant here
by bar, then I have--

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
then my Phillips
curve is really this.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It's inflation, then I have
a constant minus alpha u.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the simplest of
the downward sloping

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:90%
relationship I can have.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
That case is a
downward sloping line.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it could be
nonlinear and so on.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:90%
But this captures the essence.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's a theory
for why Phillips was

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
finding what he was finding.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Our theory of the wage of the
labor market, if you will,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and the price setting
behavior of firms

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
gives us a Phillips curve of
the kind that he had in mind.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in
the '60s in the US,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:84%
then you see this negative
relationship that eventually

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%
became steeper.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't linear like this.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a little convex,
but it's downward sloping.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, to some extent,
our very own Bob Solow and Paul

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Samuelson were advising the
US government at the time

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, let's
exploit this stuff a little.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We like to have
lower unemployment.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We can live with a
little more inflation,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
but we know that it's
a negative trade off.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a negative trade off
between these two things.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we'd like to lower
unemployment, it's fine.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We get a little
more of inflation.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And initially the
deal was very good

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.058 align:middle line:84%
because this curve was
very flat, you see?

00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So you could cut
unemployment a lot--

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.725 align:middle line:90%
you can see the dates here.

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
You're cutting
unemployment a lot

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're not getting
a lot of inflation.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the deal turned
into a much rotten deal--

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.803 align:middle line:84%
much more rotten
deal, because then

00:16:42.803 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to lower a little bit
more unemployment,

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we start getting a
lot more inflation.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.907 align:middle line:84%
So people, for a while,
were OK with this model,

00:16:50.907 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:90%
assuming that inflation was low.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But when they realized that
this thing was being exploited,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
then they began to change
the expectations they made.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what we had here.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.533 align:middle line:84%
But the region held pretty
well during this time.

00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, it became
steeper and steeper

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
as we pushed it more and
more towards very low levels

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.577 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:17:12.577 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's the story.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.618 align:middle line:84%
But again, there is your
model of the Phillips curve.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very good model
for the times where Phillips

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:90%
also estimated his Phillips.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now if you turn the page
and look at the same data

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s, look how it looks.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So from 1970 to 1995, that's
the data you have there,

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
there is no negative
relationship.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all over the place.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So had Mr Phillips
been born a few years--

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
a few decades later and had
he estimated his regression,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
he would have found nothing.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
curve in his honor,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
at least he had run
that same regression.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.308 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he would have run
a different regression.

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:90%
But nothing.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what happened?

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, our theory can explain
as well what happened there.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember the theory
is not that inflation

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is equal to a constant
minus alpha u.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
The theory says
this is a constant

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:84%
only if the mode of
expectation is this constant.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But if the expectation
is moving around,

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
or if anything in this
constant is moving around,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
then there is another
source of variation.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:90%
For example, what happens--

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.025 align:middle line:84%
suppose you are here in 1965
and all of a sudden, you get--

00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:90%
the price of oil goes up a lot.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
capture the price of oil

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:90%
with an increase in m.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Firms need to mark up
things more in order

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:90%
to cover higher energy costs.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at what m does.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
m says that for any given
level of unemployment,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:90%
now I get higher inflation.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what an oil
shock does, no?

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You get an oil shock, then for
any given level of unemployment

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
now, you find yourself
with more inflation.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So that moves you in
the opposite direction.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It moves you up there.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
for these points around here.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We got lots of inflation because
we got massive oil shocks during

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:90%
the '70s and early '80s.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We had wars in the Middle
East and so on that

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:90%
led to those shocks.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
reasons we got shots here,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:90%
to this term here.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of muddied
the relationship.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason, which
is more interesting, I think,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and that you already began to
see that something was happening

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:84%
here is that as
inflation went up,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
people stopped
believing in this model.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.885 align:middle line:84%
So the expectation
formation mechanism changed.

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So this guy began to react
to endogenous variables.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to explain
more precisely why.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
mean by expecting

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:90%
inflation became deanchored.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It was no longer anchored
around this constant of 2%,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:90%
but it became deanchored.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It began to follow the data.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So if the data came
with more inflation,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
then people believed
that next year,

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
we would have more
inflation as well.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Not back to 2%, but if we
got 5% inflation today,

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:90%
people began to say, well, OK.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that next year--

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:90%
my best estimate is 2%.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.878 align:middle line:90%
It's probably closer to 5%.

00:20:29.878 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's what it
means, deanchoring.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what has the fed and most
central banks around the world

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%
terrified today.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Inflation is much higher
than 2% and they're

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
very worried about this
guy becoming deanchored,

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
or unanchored.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll get back to
that in a second.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, but let me explain
how this expected inflation

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:90%
term works.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So let me replace the model of
expected inflation for something

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
which is some weighted average
of a constant and the most

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:90%
recent inflation.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So this model says, what
is my expected inflation

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.510 align:middle line:90%
for next year?

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an average
of this long run target

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that we have, say,
2%, and whatever

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
was the most recent inflation.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:84%
If theta-- in the model
I showed you before,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
the one that applied
to the '60s and so on--

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
up to the '60s had
essentially theta equal to 0.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So this guy didn't show up
there and expected inflation

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:90%
was very well anchored.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
What, what began to happen
as we began to move that way

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and then we got
hit by oil shocks,

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:84%
so people began to see
much higher inflation

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
numbers than they were
used to, then this theta

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
began to increase.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So people began to change
the model of expectation

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and began to think
that the inflation was

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be more persistent than
they used to think in the past.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So high inflation today means
high inflation tomorrow.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means
more persistent.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:84%
In the past, it was
high inflation today.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:90%
That was a backdraw.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll go back to the
normal long run average.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Now that's no longer the case.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And so if I replace
this more general model

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
of expected inflation here
in the Phillips curve,

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I get this expression, which
now has this extra term.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So we used to have
theta equal to 0.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But during the '70s and '80s,
and even early '90s, actually

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that theta got to
be very close to 1.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
You estimate these
models, you get

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.910 align:middle line:90%
that theta was very close to 1.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And look at what happens when
theta gets very close to 1.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So when theta is 1, literally,
then the best forecast

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:84%
for inflation is the
previous inflation.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So this year is 5%, and
I think next year is 5%.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Not 2%, 5%.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
If this year is 7%, I think
next year is 7% again.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so if you do that,
then my expected inflation

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
becomes lag inflation
by t minus 1.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So if I replace the expected
inflation for pi t minus 1,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I get to this
Phillips curve, which

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I can rewrite as the
change in inflation--

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
as a relationship between
the change in inflation

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and the level of unemployment.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So now what you have is that
if unemployment is very low,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:90%
then inflation is picking up.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It's going-- so if inflation--
if unemployment is very low, not

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
only the inflation is high, but
it's also growing over time.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
sometimes people

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:84%
refer to this formulation
of the Phillips curve

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.617 align:middle line:84%
as the accelerationist
Phillips curve,

00:23:44.617 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
because now it's the
relation between unemployment

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and the change in inflation.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you estimate
this Phillips curve,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
this accelerationist Phillips
curve on the data I just showed

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
you of the '70s and '80s, you
get a much better relationship.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You still have the oil
shocks that mess things up,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
but you start recovering
this negative relationship.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's between
the change in inflation

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and the level of unemployment.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very scary
situation for the central bank

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to find itself in, because
it's very easy for things

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:90%
to escalate.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So by the mid-90s, we had
reanchored expectations.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:84%
There were very
aggressive policies

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to control inflation by
Paul Volcker in the US

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and it was imitated around
the world with some lag.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:90%
But inflation became reanchored.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So we went back to this
theta equal to 0 type model.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The expected
inflation in the US--

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
the target inflation of the
central bank was around 2%.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:84%
That became what people
expected for the next year

00:24:54.310 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and that reanchored-- so we
went back, in other words,

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to that Phillips curve.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what central
banks want to be at.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They want to have inflation
expectations very well anchored.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
successful after the '90s.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we got into
again-- now look.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm not running
the accelerationist--

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm again running inflation
against unemployment

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and you again see this
downward sloping relationship.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:90%
So that was very good news.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a great success
of monetary policy during

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
the '90s and later was the
reanchoring of expected

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
inflation again all around
the developed world,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and many of the--

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
even Latin America.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Many economists in Latin America
reanchored their expectations,

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Asia, and so on.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good time
for central banks.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing I want to
do, this will connect more

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
with the previous
lecture, and it's

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the last thing I want
to say for this lecture,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and I may start the
review afterwards,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:84%
is that I want to
connect now this Phillips

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:17.995 align:middle line:84%
curve with something
we discussed

00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
lecture, which is

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.662 align:middle line:90%
a natural rate of unemployment.

00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the way you
typically see the Phillips

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.380 align:middle line:84%
curve written and
that's also the way

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that when Chairman Powell is
talking about the labor market

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:84%
tightness and so
on, he's not talking

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.017 align:middle line:84%
relative to m, and z,
and things like that.

00:26:37.017 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
He's talking relative to what
is called the natural rate

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go from
a Phillips curve that

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
looks like that the one that has
the natural rate of unemployment

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the last
step in this lecture.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So remember the definition
of the natural rate

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment?

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
What was the definition of the
natural rate of unemployment?

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Was it the unemployment rate
that God gave us, any God?

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It had a very precise
meaning for us.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we used exactly
that model to figure it out.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We saw-- actually, we saw the
natural rate of unemployment

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:90%
from something like this.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we had-- the function is
still generic function F of u z,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:84%
but we solved from an
expression like this.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And we said, under
one assumption,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
we can call this u, un, the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.890 align:middle line:90%
What was that assumption?

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.015 align:middle line:90%
And that's the only thing--

00:27:58.015 --> 00:28:00.425 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: The price is equal
to the expected price.

00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Expected price

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:90%
is equal to the actual price.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So we said, if this
is equal to that,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
then you solve out the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only thing that
natural rate of unemployment

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:84%
means, simply that
when the price is

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:90%
equal to the expected price.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But if the price is equal
to expected price, what

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:28.023 align:middle line:90%
else is equal?

00:28:28.023 --> 00:28:32.753 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.936 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed at the
right expressions.

00:28:35.936 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Inflation
is equal to expected inflation.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So I can use the same
logic I used here

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:84%
for the natural
rate of unemployment

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
using the Phillips curve.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I can say, OK, I can solve
out for the natural rate

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment here simply by
setting the expected inflation

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
equal to actual inflation.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And if I do this, I can
solve for the natural rate

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment from here, un.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm going to give--

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put the
superscript n here when

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.695 align:middle line:90%
you let me replace pi for pi.

00:29:10.695 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I replaced
this pi e for pi

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.482 align:middle line:84%
is what allows me to put
the superscript n there.

00:29:18.482 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Call it the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.287 align:middle line:90%
And now I can solve it.

00:29:21.287 --> 00:29:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously that
cancels with that

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and I can solve the natural
rate of unemployment,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's equal to
this function here.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So why is the natural rate
of unemployment increasing m?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.905 align:middle line:84%
A question like that
can come up in the quiz.

00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to use the
Phillips curve to ask you,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:90%
if I ask you about that.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:90%
But I can ask you that.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens to a natural rate
of unemployment if m goes up?

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You know that un will go up,
but what is the mechanism?

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So why does the natural
rate of unemployment

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:90%
go up when the markup goes up?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.288 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] our
main cause and we just

00:30:08.288 --> 00:30:09.727 align:middle line:90%
have to go down, right?

00:30:09.727 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
I mean, another way

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:84%
of saying it is that the firms
are not willing to pay-- they

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:90%
want to pay a lower real wage.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
At the original
level of unemployment

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:84%
before the change in
m, workers would not

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.418 align:middle line:90%
take that lower real wage.

00:30:26.418 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not an equilibrium real
wage, because workers say,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:90%
no, no.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
At this level of unemployment,
we need a higher real wage.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to restore
equilibrium in that model we had

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
was to increase
unemployment, because that

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
will lower the bargaining
power of workers,

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and they will end up accepting
the lower real wage that firms

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:90%
are willing to offer now.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason and
we get this markup effect.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.328 align:middle line:90%
z is same logic.

00:30:56.328 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a little easier
to see it there,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.250 align:middle line:84%
but z means, well, at any
given level of unemployment,

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:84%
an increase in z means workers
want a higher real wage.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Firms are not willing to
pay a higher real wage.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have to bring down the
real wage and workers' demand,

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.887 align:middle line:84%
and the only way that can happen
is with a higher unemployment.

00:31:15.887 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason the
natural rate of unemployment

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:90%
is also increasing in z.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And now the last step.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:90%
The last step is to--

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
you see, I can go back to
my Philips curve, say that.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to replace
m plus z for alpha un.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I can do that, you see?

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I can replace this m plus
z for alpha times un.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.598 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.598 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, m plus z, z is
equal to un times alpha.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
We can replace in the Phillips
curve m plus c by alpha un

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and I can therefore
rewrite the Phillips curve

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in the following form.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Inflation is equal
to expected inflation

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:84%
minus alpha times the gap
between the unemployment rate

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and the natural rate
of unemployment.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So when Chairman Powell is
worried about labor market very

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:84%
tight, what he's saying
is, well, unemployment

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
is likely to be below the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if unemployment
is below the natural rate

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment, that's putting
upward pressure on inflation.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's a-- so
that's what he means.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
This gap is very important for
macroeconomists, and certainly

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:54.510 align:middle line:84%
for central bankers that are
very worried about inflation,

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:90%
that gap here.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, is this is a
difficult object to estimate.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So you have to have estimates.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.035 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that it's very
difficult to know what it is,

00:33:05.035 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
although there are
estimates out there,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to show you one.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You notice that
something is wrong when

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.680 align:middle line:90%
this guy starts speaking up.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.545 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
the other way around.

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The US, in fact, had the
opposite problem before COVID.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It's that somehow,
unemployment was

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
very low, relative
to historical levels,

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
but inflation was
not picking up.

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So that was
implicitly telling us

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that for some reason
not fully understood,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the natural rate of
unemployment was declining.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So here is one
picture that looks--

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:90%
is one estimate.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't trust
any particular estimate,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:90%
but it tells a story.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:84%
That's one particular
estimate of the natural rate

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.190 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment in the
US, that blue line.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in red,
the red is the actual rate

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment in the US.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
situations like this?

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think was
happening to inflation

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
in this episode, which is right
after the global financial

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:90%
crisis, or the Great Recession?

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
need to read here?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, the unemployment
rate was a lot higher

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
than the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Does that put upward or
downward pressure on inflation?

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Downward pressure on inflation.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Unemployment is very high
relative to natural rate

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.288 align:middle line:84%
It's minus alpha
times u minus un.

00:34:35.288 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.955 align:middle line:84%
We had lots of problems
with inflation.

00:34:37.955 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Inflation was going very low.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:84%
We even had negative
inflation there,

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:90%
a little deflation for a while.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:90%
So that was the problem.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.587 align:middle line:84%
Here is the period that
I described before.

00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a little mysterious,
because we went-- unemployment

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:84%
went below what we thought was
a natural rate of unemployment

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and inflation wasn't
really picking up a lot.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.798 align:middle line:84%
At the end, it began
to pick up a little.

00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't picking
up a lot, and that

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:90%
was a little bit of a mystery.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in this
situation here,

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which we have extremely
low unemployment

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:90%
and very high inflation.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think this captures
well the situation right now.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a negative gap
between unemployment

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and the natural rate
of unemployment.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason that's
putting a lot of pressure

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.625 align:middle line:90%
on inflation.

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We also have other things
that are putting pressure

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.167 align:middle line:84%
on inflation that come from
the supply side of the economy

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So that combination is pretty
bad for the inflation outcomes

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and outlook as well.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.578 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we're at.

00:35:40.578 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a lot
more about this, because this

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:90%
is what is going on right now.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.443 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about that?

00:35:46.443 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I want to start
sort of reviewing things.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Although, I don't know--

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:90%
any question about this?

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.582 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is the only way
to fix it this direction

00:35:55.582 --> 00:35:56.948 align:middle line:90%
to increase unemployment?

00:35:56.948 --> 00:35:57.990 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Sorry?

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is the only way to
fix, I guess, the inflationary--

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.933 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Well,
that's a very good question.

00:36:03.933 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to decide what to
answer it with what we have.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
There are two views
at this moment.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
There's one view that says
there's no way around that.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Just look at this curve.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:84%
It says, look, there
is no way around that.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
we need a recession.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, we're not
going to control inflation.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:84%
A recession means
high unemployment.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:90%
That's one view.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, it's
becoming the dominant view.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It has gone in cycles.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But at this moment,
it's the dominant view.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:84%
There is another
view, which is the one

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that the central bank, the
fed adopted for a while that

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
said, well, this is not the
only indicator of tightness

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:90%
of the labor market.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:90%
There is other things as well.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And those indicators are
moving in the right direction.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we may be able not
to create a big mess here

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:84%
because these other factors are
moving in the right direction.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of those factors
are, as I said,

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:28.343 align:middle line:84%
other measures of labor market
tightness and hiring, the flows.

00:37:28.343 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember I showed you
flows between employment

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.218 align:middle line:84%
and unemployment, out of
employment, and so on?

00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Those flows look extremely
tight and now they're improving.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So the gaps in those
dimensions are better.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is there was
a big cost push component, which

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.080 align:middle line:90%
is what I said before.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The supply chains
and so on created

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:84%
extra inflation,
abnormal inflation,

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:90%
like increasing markups.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
m was very high.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And some of that is
subsiding as well.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So there are
dynamics that suggest

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that inflation is declining
even without unemployment.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the median voter
in this space of forecasts,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:84%
of inflation and so
on thinks that we

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
will need some adjustment
through this part as well.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:90%
My main concern--

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that the path the fed
is forecasting is feasible,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:90%
but a very narrow path.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it may happen.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And to me, whether they're
successful at not creating

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:84%
a big mess here, I mean
bringing unemployment very high

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
inflation down,

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with
whether somehow we

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:84%
manage to keep expected
inflation anchored.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And there was some evidence--

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I think I said that
a few lectures ago.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:48.395 align:middle line:84%
There was some evidence
that in the summer of 2022.

00:38:48.395 --> 00:38:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm from the
Southern hemisphere,

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
so I get always confused
with summers and so on.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So in the summer of 2022,
US summer of 2022, inflation

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:90%
was becoming very unanchored.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.480 align:middle line:84%
This guy, one year expected
inflation was creeping up to 6%,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and that was very scary.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Because think what happened.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If you get expected
inflation at 6%,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:84%
then it's not enough to bring an
employment to the natural rate

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment to get inflation
back to the 2% we like,

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because you need to bring
expected inflation down now.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And that means you need to bring
the unemployment rate very, very

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:84%
high in order to
re-anchor expectation.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
scary situation.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
They were very
persuasive, though,

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the summer with
very hawkish speeches and so on.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And they managed to
re-anchor expected inflation.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Expected inflation very quickly
came down to 2%, 2.5% one year

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:90%
out even.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But now it has been picking up
again and now we're around 3%

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:44.830 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
scary where we are.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So to me, this is going to
be very important in that.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So if inflation keeps
lingering around 6%

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and
eventually, expected

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
inflation becomes
unanchored, then there's

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:84%
almost no way around but to have
a recession to get out of that.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't happen, if
they succeed convincing people

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that they're very
serious about this stuff

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and they re-anchor
expected inflation,

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:84%
then we don't need to
create a large recession.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Still, they may create causes
because accidents happen,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.330 align:middle line:90%
but they don't need to.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But they will need to if
this guy gets unanchored.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually, maybe I can use
even this expression here

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:84%
to explain what
I'm trying to say.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that again,
this is material really

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.200 align:middle line:90%
for the next lecture.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.020 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
say is that if they

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
manage to keep this theta
very close to 0, then in order

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to bring inflation back to their
target of pi bar, 2% or so,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:84%
all that they
really need to do is

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring unemployment to the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:41:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So they only need to
really fix this gap.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
They need to raise unemployment
so it closes that gap.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.680 align:middle line:90%
But it's a small change.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, they succeed keeping
expected inflation at around 2%.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, suppose that
theta becomes very far from 0.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Then we have a problem.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Because then expected inflation
is above the target, no?

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Because we have 6%.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:90%
So suppose that is equal to 1.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We have 6%, then
expected inflation is 6%.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:84%
That means that if your
expected inflation is 6%, then

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring the
inflation-- if you bring

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
unemployment just to the
natural rate of unemployment,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:84%
so the red line
to the blue line,

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:middle line:84%
you haven't made
a lot of progress.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
All that you have done is you
have brought down inflation

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:84%
to 6%, which is
expected inflation.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you have expected
inflation of 6%,

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:84%
you need to bring
unemployment much higher

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:84%
than the natural
rate of unemployment

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:10.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring inflation
back to the target of 2%.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason I say
to me, the fight will be--

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the battle will be won or
lost on that term there.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Yep?

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.980 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: How much of this
current inflationary pressure

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.347 align:middle line:84%
is caused by unemployment
and how much of it

00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:90%
caused on the supply side?

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like a lot of
the stuff, like CPI going up,

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
energy prices going up, how much
can the fed control something

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Well, it
varies at different places

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the US, for a while, a
big component of the inflation

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:84%
was all that stuff,
bottlenecks in the ports

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.965 align:middle line:90%
That's almost all gone.

00:42:52.965 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
of that left.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:90%
So now it's aggregate demand.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.103 align:middle line:84%
People feel very rich
for a variety of reasons.

00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:84%
They're spending a lot, and
that's the reason unemployment

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is very low.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not unemployment
per se, it's

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:84%
just that aggregate
demand is very high.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that translates into
very low unemployment

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and that feeds into
inflation this way,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.380 align:middle line:90%
through wages and so on.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But in the US, the component
of aggregate demand

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:90%
is much larger than in Europe.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.510 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, those supply side
factors are much more important.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So around yeah, the summer of
2022, you could say both Europe

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and the US are about the same
amount of excess inflation.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.910 align:middle line:84%
We're hold with
around 10% inflation.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But in the US was 2/3
excess aggregate demand,

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
while in Europe was 2/3
problems on the supply side,

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:84%
especially because of the
war and stuff like that.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But for the US today, it's
mostly an aggregate demand

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to get a lot of--

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
obviously, if the war
stops, that's going to help.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's not going to be enough.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to-- just the
economy is too hot.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's too much aggregate
demand out there.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.858 align:middle line:90%
That's the fundamental problem.

00:44:10.858 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Can you explain
again why an increase in z

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:84%
would increase the natural
rate of unemployment?

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
An increase in z?

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So for that, the base is
the previous slide diagram,

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:90%
but remember what z does.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let me go
to this equation here.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So we can figure it out in
these two equations here.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
If z goes up, that means for
any given level of unemployment,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:84%
unexpected inflation,
wages go up.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Workers demand a higher wage.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.425 align:middle line:90%
But remember that the firms--

00:44:53.425 --> 00:44:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.282 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:44:57.282 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
natural rate of unemployment,

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
so let me replace this
Pe for P, first of all.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to divide
W by P on both sides.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So I get-- if z
goes up, the workers

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:20.810 align:middle line:84%
want a higher real wage, because
if z goes up, then W over P,

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm dividing by P
both sides, goes up.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Workers demand a higher wage.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But the firms,
from here, you can

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:84%
see that I can divide by
P both sides, W over P

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that the firms offer is
equal to 1 over 1 plus m.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So the firms are not going
to offer a higher real wage.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The workers want a
higher real wage.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.330 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
can restore equilibrium

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that the workers end up
demanding the same real wage

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.550 align:middle line:84%
as the firms are
willing to pay is

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, the hands of
the worker gets weakened.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And the only variable here
that can weaken their hand

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:59.120 align:middle line:90%
is higher unemployment.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.910 align:middle line:90%
So let me put it all in.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So at the natural rate, I
know that P is equal to P.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So that means the wage setting
equation implies W over P

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:90%
equals F u, z.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:32.080 align:middle line:84%
From the price setting
equation, I have that W over P

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 1 over 1 plus m.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So in this very simple
model, this is given.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.767 align:middle line:84%
If this guy goes up, these
guys want a higher real wage.

00:46:41.767 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But that cannot happen because
that would be inconsistent with

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:90%
the price setting.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
bring down this guy.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.600 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
can bring it down

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:90%
is for unemployment to go up.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.823 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- at P, we call that
a natural rate of unemployment.

00:46:55.823 --> 00:47:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:05.190 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Last lecture, we
talked about the labor force

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.530 align:middle line:90%
participation rate.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.362 align:middle line:84%
Is there any reason to try and
increase that to increase--

00:47:11.362 --> 00:47:13.320 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Oh,
that would be fantastic.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.750 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is there a
policy that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.240 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Well, I mean there

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.630 align:middle line:90%
are negative policies as well.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.410 align:middle line:84%
z reduction, in a sense,
does that, because there

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:84%
was emergency
unemployment benefits,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.330 align:middle line:84%
an emergency income
supplement and so on

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.380 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the pandemic
that are disappearing slowly.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
natural, so it's going

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:90%
to bring participation back up.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And it is beginning to pick up.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you need to
incentivize return to work.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And now there are some
people that there is nothing,

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that they retire, essentially,
or they have health problems

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and they just cannot return.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.920 align:middle line:90%
We lost that.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other margin, which is
very important, is immigration.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big issue, because
immigration, obviously--

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.900 align:middle line:90%
we lost, I think in the US--

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a labor economist,
but we lost, I think,

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:84%
a flow of the order of 500,000
people a year during COVID.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big chunk of
the decline in the labor.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.120 align:middle line:84%
No, what you need
is more employment.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.390 align:middle line:84%
That's going to-- that
puts downward pressure

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:84%
on wages for the same
amount of aggregate demand.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you need.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that's
a very good point.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We're taking all
that as given here.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we're fixing all that.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't,
then other terms

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.680 align:middle line:84%
start appearing in this
expression and so on.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.405 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:42.405 --> 00:48:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm not going
to start the review.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.630 align:middle line:90%
We have only one minute.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So in the next
lecture, I'll just

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
review the material
for the quiz.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:90%
