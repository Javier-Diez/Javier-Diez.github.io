00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Let's start
with the Mundell-Fleming model.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a model that I
think is extremely useful.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the short term it
will be important for you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
because probably 70% of
the quiz will be related

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
to things, to this model.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we're going to use
this model for different things.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
it well, you probably

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
have 70% of the last
quiz under control.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
very slowly over it.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And please stop me if there is
any step you don't understand.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I put steps into
myself so I don't rush.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I think it's
important to understand things.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the exchange
rate, two exchange rates.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The white one is the euro
dollar exchange rate.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.663 align:middle line:84%
I'm quoting it the opposite of
the way it's normally quoted.

00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
There are some conventions
in effects markets.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is, as we have defined
in this course, if it goes up,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
it means an appreciation
of a local currency.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:90%
That is the dollar.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That is, you get more of the
foreign currency per unit

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
of the domestic currency
when it goes up, and down

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
is a depreciation.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And you see there that--

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
this is the dollar became a
gain value relative to the euro

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:90%
through all this period.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it has lost
quite a bit of value

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
since sort of late 2022, with
respect to the Japanese yen.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the blue line.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The whole cycle is
even more dramatic.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Big appreciation of the dollar.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Depreciation of the yen.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And a reversal since
late 2022 and so.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So what is behind
this big fluctuations?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Many things.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Effects are volatile, like
almost any asset price.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But one of the main drivers
of these fluctuations

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
is perceptions
about interest rate

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
policy in the different
parts of the world.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we have seen
a lot of this decline here--

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the reason for the
rise here of the dollar

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
is mostly because
investors in general

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.603 align:middle line:84%
perceive that the US was more
advanced in its business cycle.

00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It began to tighten
interest rates

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
before the rest of the world.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And since interest rates
were rising in the US,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that led to an appreciation
of the dollar by a mechanism

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
that I describe at the end
of the previous lecture.,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to repeat today.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Remember when I talk about
the uncover interest parity

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's related to what
I'm talking about here.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I, again,
go again over that.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And a big reason for the
decline more recently

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
is simply that there is a sense
that monetary policy is peaking

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in the US in terms of tightness
while the rest of the world

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
is catching up.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Europe,
more than catching up

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
because they have further supply
shocks coming from energy shocks

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you look, for example, at
the expected policy rate path,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the US,
nowadays it looks like this.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So the steel markets expect
some hikes in the US,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
but a limited amount
of hikes and then

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
they expect quickly the
Fed to start undoing that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
path is telling you.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
This is expected
policy rate path.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:84%
What the market thinks
now, the policy rate

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
will be in the next meeting,
two meetings from now,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
three meetings from now, four
meetings, meetings of the FOMC

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.428 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, if you look at
the same picture in Europe,

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:90%
it looks like that.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that there
still is more ahead.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And you see that.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what the market
perceives at this point.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.117 align:middle line:84%
Whether that ends up being
true or not doesn't matter.

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
At any point in time
the exchange rate

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
is determined by what
the markets think.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So what actually happens is less
important for an asset price.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
An asset price is a lot
about pricing today things

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that you expect to
happen in the future.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.417 align:middle line:84%
But what you expect
is what matters,

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:90%
not what actually happens.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment, the
market expect the Euro area

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
to go through a more
prolonged period of hiking,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:90%
interest rate, hiking.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Japan hasn't had hikes
in interest rates

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:90%
for three decades.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But even now, you
begin to see some--

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:90%
the scale here is very small.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:90%
These are a few basis points.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But even the point
I'm trying to make

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is that certainly people
expect interest rates in the US

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to go down relative to
interest rates in Japan.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that the
interest rate in the US

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
will be lower than the
interest rate in Japan,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
but the direction of the
change is in that way.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So relative to where we're at
now, the direction of the change

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is towards the US
loosening monetary policy

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
before the rest
of the world does

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is leading
to these big swings.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I said before, this is a
period in which the US have

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to start tightening before
the rest and the currency

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
appreciated a lot, especially
with respect to the yen.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the yen has been
against the zero lower bound

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So nobody expected the yen
to move, to follow the US.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And with respect to
Europe, well, Europe

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
was having inflationary
problems and so on, as well.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So people expected it to
follow the US at some point.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
For Japan, there was
nothing like that.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led to
a massive depreciation

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of the yen, appreciation of the
US dollar vis a vis the yen.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So what the Mundell-Fleming
model is about

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.397 align:middle line:84%
is about first
connecting these things,

00:06:00.397 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand what
moves the exchange rate,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
how the different monetary
policies in different places

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
or different policies in
different places of the world

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
affect the exchange rate.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it's about
understanding how those exchange

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:84%
rate movements affect real
activity in the short run that's

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
what the Mundell-Fleming
model is.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So it is really, we're going to
go back to our old IS-LM model,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:90%
very short run.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to even fix
nominal prices and so on.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:90%
So back to that environment.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to do
it in an open economy.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have a new
variable floating around,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:90%
which is the exchange rate.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
how the exchange rate moves

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
when different things happen
in different countries

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and what is the impact of
that on aggregate demand,

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:90%
and hence, on output--

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a very
short run in the different parts

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's the plan.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what we intend to do.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the
Mundell-Fleming model.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we wrote down the
equilibrium in the goods market

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:90%
in the previous lecture.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just reproducing what I
wrote in the previous lecture.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So it looks exactly
like the closed economy.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Output is being determined
by aggregate demand.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's aggregate demand for
domestically produced goods.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Domestically produced goods is
not the same as domestic demand

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
for goods, which is
this, because now there

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:90%
is a net export term.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So part of the things
that residents demand,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
they demand from the
rest of the world,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
not from domestic producers.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.748 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, part
of the demand perceived

00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
by domestic producers comes
from the rest of the world,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.582 align:middle line:84%
from exports, not from
domestic producers.

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason we
got an extra term here,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
which is this net exports.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And we said this net exports
is a function of three things.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a function of output.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's a decreasing
function of output.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Why is that-- of
domestic output?

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Domestic output.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Domestic income.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Why is it a decreasing
function of domestic income?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.385 align:middle line:84%
Why do net exports decline
when domestic income rises?

00:08:11.385 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: People might be
more inclined to buy imports.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
They import more.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.848 align:middle line:90%
They consume everything more.

00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:90%
But part of that is import.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so part of that
energy of the extra demand

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:90%
goes to foreign goods.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
deteriorates net exports.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.095 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason,
had we just stopped there,

00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
made the net export function
just a function of output,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
we would have not needed
all these extra parameters

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to build because
all that would have meant

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.162 align:middle line:84%
is that just we have
a smaller multiplier.

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
exactly the same

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:84%
as we did in the closed economy,
but with a smaller multiplier,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
because every time an output
goes up, now part of that demand

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
goes to foreign goods
rather than domestic goods.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's not so--

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
first, because we have
an extra another income

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that matters here, which is the
income of the rest of the world.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, because
we also have an exchange.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:90%
But let's start from this side.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So net exports is increasing the
income of the rest of the world.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:84%
That is, demand for
domestically produced goods

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
rises when foreign
income goes up.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
For an output, for
income goes up.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.375 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
The symmetric
argument with inputs.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, our exports are the
imports of the other country.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So if the income in the
other country goes up,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
then their imports will go up,
which is our exports that go up.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
net exports goes up.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And the last term,
remember, says

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that net exports is declining
on the real exchange rate.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.608 align:middle line:84%
What happened when the
real exchange rate goes up?

00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It makes our
goods more expensive

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:90%
relative to foreign goods.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Our goods become more expensive
relative to foreign goods,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and that affects us
from two dimensions.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
First, our exports will tend to
decline because our goods are

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:90%
more expensive.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, our imports
are going to tend

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to increase because
foreign goods are cheaper.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason this
is decreasing with respect

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to the exchange rate.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The big thing of the
Mundell-Fleming model

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
really comes from the fact
that this guy is there.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.723 align:middle line:84%
Had we not had the
exchange rate there,

00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
again, we could have used
exactly the same apparatus

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.805 align:middle line:90%
as we used earlier on.

00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to have an
exchange rate floating around.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And that will require us to
build more, a little more.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We need an extra
equation, because we have

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:90%
an extra endogenous variable.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm going
to assume here,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
as we did in the first
part of the course,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
is that both the domestic
and foreign prices

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:90%
are completely fixed.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ignore
Phillips curve, inflation,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:84%
expected inflation, and all
that, and assume all that is 0.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Expected inflation,
inflation, zero.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
When I do that,
the same equation,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the equilibrium in the goods
markets changes a little bit.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's the same equation.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.752 align:middle line:84%
But now I don't need
to differentiate

00:11:18.752 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
between real interest rate
and nominal interest rate

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:90%
because inflation is zero.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So nominal interest rate is
equal to the real interest rate.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stick in here
the nominal interest rate.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Second, I really don't
need to differentiate

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
between real exchange rate
and nominal exchange rate

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
because the relative prices,
the prices themselves are not

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so all that will move
the real exchange rate

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
is the nominal exchange rate.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
I'm going to write

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
here the nominal exchange
rate is because it's

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that will move
this variable around given

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:90%
that prices are fixed.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So our equilibrium
in the goods market.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing you
need to compare with lecture

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:90%
three or something like that.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, this part here
only lowers the multiplier, so

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
not a big change.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
This one here is
an extra parameter

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that shifts aggregate
demand up and down.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can treat it almost
like we treated [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as the consumer
confidence goes up,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
then aggregate demand goes up.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we have the rest
of the world's output goes up.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
It does exactly the
same, the same analysis.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.185 align:middle line:84%
The problem we have, though, is
that we have an extra variable

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
here, which is
the exchange rate.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
endogenous variable.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to come
up with some other equation

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:90%
to solve for that equation here.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
In lecture 3 or
4, what we did is,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, we said we have two
endogenous variable, output

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:90%
and the interest rate--

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:90%
output and the interest rate.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
We need one more equation.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other equation was
just monetary policy that

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:90%
set the nominal interest rate.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Here, that's not
going to be enough

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
because we also have an
exchange rate floating around.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So we need to bring
another equation here

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this new
endogenous variable.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that extra equation?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.893 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the uncovered
interest parity condition.

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's the
last expression

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.873 align:middle line:84%
we had in the previous
lecture that takes this form.

00:13:16.873 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Before I simplify lots of
things, I wrote this down.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And it says that the exchange
rate is equal to that.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is this?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Where does this
equation come from?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it trying to do?

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talked about
this in the context of say,

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.723 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, when
you open goods markets,

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
then you need a
relative price to decide

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to buy.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
real exchange did.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we open
the capital account.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And then people need to
decide where are they

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:90%
going to invest their money.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.455 align:middle line:84%
And that equation
was related to that.

00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Expected
rate of return

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:90%
has to be the same for domestic.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.613 align:middle line:84%
It's what equalizes
expected rate of return.

00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In equilibrium,
that has to happen.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, in reality, there
is risk adjustment.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
There is lots of other factors
that we're removing from here.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But absent those other
factors, the returns

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
have to be similar
in both places

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.698 align:middle line:84%
because if one
asset is giving more

00:14:22.698 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
return than the other
expected return,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.528 align:middle line:84%
then people are
going to invest all

00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:90%
their portfolios in that asset.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is those flows that

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
try to go to those assets that
give the highest return end up

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
equalizing expected
return in equilibrium.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the equation that
does that, exactly that.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, remember,
I can divide this

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
by the exchange
rate on both sides.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then what you get is 1
equal to a numerator that

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
has the nominal exchange
rate times the expected

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
appreciation of the currency.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the denominator, you
have the foreign interest rate.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
compare the two, you

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
have to compare one base
interest rate, the domestic

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.718 align:middle line:84%
or the foreign, plus the
expected appreciation

00:15:11.718 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of the appreciation
of that currency.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
term is doing here,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:90%
this divided by that.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:90%
So what do we get out of this?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
One thing we're going
to do for quite a while,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
because it will simplify
things a lot, but sometimes

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
also lead to confusion in the
way we understand why currencies

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
depreciate or appreciate.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But we'll pause and I'll
remind you of this repeatedly.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume for now
that the expected exchange

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
rate for t plus 1 is fixed.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And until I tell
you otherwise, we're

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:90%
going to make this assumption.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a huge
simplification, completely

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:90%
unrealistic, and so on.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.313 align:middle line:84%
But it will help me
explain the mechanism.

00:16:01.313 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things
that moves exchanges a lot

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.147 align:middle line:84%
is that people have
lots of expectations

00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:90%
about future exchange rates.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that later.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But for now, so you
understand the mechanism,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
how the Mundell-Fleming
model works,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume that we all
know what the expected exchange

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
rate-- we all have a common
expected exchange rate

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%
and it's fixed.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:90%
We may move it as a parameter.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to say, I'm
not going to endogenize that.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take it as fixed.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I may move it
around to show you

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:90%
what happens when that changes.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to endogenize it.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I need more
equations, one more.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to stop this
sequence of equations

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that I would have to build.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Later we'll understand more
that, what I just said.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But for now, just
take this as fixed.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So if I take this as fixed,
now I have an equation.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I was
looking for an equation

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:90%
here for my exchange rate.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Once I do that, then
I have what I want.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I have an equation for
my exchange rate today.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just a function of
domestic interest rate,

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
international interest rate,
and the expected exchange rate.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So I know the
following, for example.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that an increase in
the domestic interest rate,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.252 align:middle line:84%
other things equal,
appreciates exchange rate.

00:17:22.252 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I can see it in the equation.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
If I move the domestic
interest rate up,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.792 align:middle line:90%
the exchange rate goes up.

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:90%
That's an appreciation.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The dollar becomes
more expensive.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Even simpler.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we start
with a situation

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
in which the domestic and the
international interest rate

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:90%
were the same.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And now I increase the
international interest rate.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying the exchange
rate will appreciate.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, let me start
with something even simpler.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that this
interest rate is

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
equal to international
interest rate

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
before analyzing the change
I'm about to analyze.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Then from this equation, what
do I know about exchange rate?

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.563 align:middle line:90%
What is it equal to?

00:18:03.563 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
If the domestic interest rate is
equal to international interest

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.535 align:middle line:84%
rate, what is the exchange
rate today equal to?

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The expected exchange
of next year.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
If I have the same
interest rates,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I cannot expect a capital gain
or loss on the currency position

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
because I have already an equal
interest rate in the two bonds.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm starting
from a situation

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
where the current
exchange rate is

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:84%
equal to the expected exchange
rate and these two are equal.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to
increase the interest rate,

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the domestic interest rate.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy for
you to read from here

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that the exchange
rate will go up.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:90%
The currency will appreciate.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This is not an easy thing
to answer unless you have

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.211 align:middle line:90%
read the book or something.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The
interest rate goes up,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
then money supply should go
down, which would generally

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:90%
increase the value of money.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Nope.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:90%
No money here.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
That money is only related
to the mechanism we

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:90%
use to increase interest rate.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying just use
that equation and the logic

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
behind that equation, the
uncovered interest parity.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that if we went
to financial situation

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.687 align:middle line:84%
which interest
were the same, now

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I increase the
domestic interest rate.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.015 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying the exchange
rate has to appreciate.

00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:23.307 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:23.307 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: No, no,
but that's a description of--

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:90%
yeah, we know that.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what is the logic?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we know the
result. What I'm

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
asking is for an economic
explanation for that result.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: More people will
want to invest in the currency,

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.398 align:middle line:84%
using currency, so the
demand go up and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:48.982 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Well, if you
go to Wall Street, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:48.982 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
they will explain
it in those terms.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not the right explanation.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But they will explain
it on those terms.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And there is some
logic behind that

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because this equation assumes
that the arbitrage happens

00:19:59.130 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Immediately things move.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But before that
happens, some people

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
will start buying more of
the one that has more return.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But this equation
already solves all that.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when this
assumption matters.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little annoying.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It bothers me for a
variety of reasons.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to use it
to understand the mechanism.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You see, if I keep the changes
fixed, we start with a situation

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
where the exchange rate was
equal to expected exchange rate.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
If I keep it fixed and I
appreciate the currency today,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.562 align:middle line:84%
then what do I expect to
happen to the dollar--

00:20:36.562 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about the dollar--

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:84%
from this period
to the next one.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.413 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we start
from a situation

00:20:41.413 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
where the exchange rate was
equal to the expected exchange

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I increase the
interest rate and I said

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:90%
the exchange rate appreciates.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then what do you expect the
exchange rate to do over

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:90%
the next period?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
If I have a move
expected exchanger, now

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the exchanger moves above
the expected exchange rate,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
what do you expect the
exchange rate to do?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It has to depreciate.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So the reason the
depreciation happens here

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is because you need to
expect depreciate the dollar

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
from this period
to the next one.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Why do I need to expect the
exchange rate to depreciate?

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So not appreciating
the currency,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
in equilibrium, I need
to expect to depreciate.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
That is, I need to expect to
lose money on the currency

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:90%
part of the trade.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Confusion is good.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
You learn from that.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And this can be very
confusing, I know.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.095 align:middle line:84%
What is this equation
trying to do?

00:21:42.095 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to make the
specter returns the same.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole idea of this.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So if I am now telling you that
one bond is paying a higher

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
interest rate than
the other one,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I need to offset that somehow.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
How do I offset it by expecting
a depreciation of the currency

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of the bond, that
is, the bond that

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is denominated in the currency
that is expected to depreciate?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So what I need to do is
compensate for the interest rate

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
differential with an
expected depreciation

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
of the currency that is
paying a higher interest rate.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.273 align:middle line:84%
So that's what, in this model,
when I fix the expected exchange

00:22:25.273 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
rate, the only way I can do that
is by appreciating the currency

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
today so I can expect it to
depreciate in the future.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the logic.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the connection
with Wall Street?

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you,
well, before this

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:90%
may happen not instantaneously.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It happens somewhat slowly.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So traders immediately will
go to the US dollar bond

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
because they see that
they have a higher return.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And it will be the case until
the currency really appreciates.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Once the currency
appreciates enough,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:90%
then that advantage disappear.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
condition is doing.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's making the spectral
return the same.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of the exchange

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
going from the
initial exchange rate

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to the new equilibrium
exchange rate,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
there may be an
opportunity there.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
start seeing these flows.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
That happens very, very fast.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's when you can
see some of those flows.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in this market, that
happens very, very quickly.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.933 align:middle line:84%
So what is typically wrong
is that then an analyst comes

00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and tells you,
explains the story,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
why the exchange rate is going
to continue to appreciate.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's just way too late.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You're already in
this environment.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.192 align:middle line:90%
You lost the trade.

00:23:36.192 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
What about an increase in the
foreign interest rate, I star?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So an increase in
the foreign interest

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
rate, let's start from the
same situation we had before.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
We start from interest rate
equal to international interest

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.182 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:23:54.182 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the exchange rate
is equal to the exchange rate.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And now the foreign
interest rate goes up.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
What is going on now in the US.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The US is sort of
stabilizing here.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And Europe is beginning to
hike a little more than the US.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So we know from the
equation that means

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
the exchange rate will fall.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:90%
That is will drop here.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So that means the exchange
rate is depreciated

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and the dollar is depreciating.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Why is the dollar depreciating?

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Needs
the same mechanism

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that you described previously,
except replacing Et with 1

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:90%
over star key.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Yeah, that's correct.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the issue here
in terms of the economics

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is that, remember, if we
start from the same interest

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.788 align:middle line:84%
rate and now all
the [INAUDIBLE] I'm

00:24:46.788 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
giving you doesn't need to start
with the same interest rate.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.148 align:middle line:84%
It's just simpler to start
from the same interest.

00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But suppose we start with
the same interest rate.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:90%
And now we increase this one.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Then that means the foreign
bond is paying a higher interest

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:90%
rate than the domestic bond.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I need to equalize
the spectral returns.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The only way I can do that is by
having an expected appreciation

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:90%
of the dollar.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.135 align:middle line:84%
Since the expected
exchange, we fix it here.

00:25:10.135 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The only way I can
give you an expected

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:84%
appreciation of the dollar is by
depreciating the dollar today.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is the same mechanism.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:90%
The same logic is symmetric.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the mechanism.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, is this true that in the
very short run, when I star

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.938 align:middle line:84%
goes up and I doesn't
move, then lots of people

00:25:30.938 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:90%
go and buy foreign bonds.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.545 align:middle line:84%
And that produces sort
of demand for euros

00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:90%
But that's very quick.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Machines do it for you now.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
So it happens very quickly.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So this equation
shows you what happens

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
after all that mess
has already cleared,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:90%
which happens in milliseconds.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, what if I change
expected exchange rate?

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So again, I'm fixing it.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.188 align:middle line:90%
But I can move it around.

00:26:02.188 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm treating it as a parameter.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
When I say I fix it, I just
don't want to endogenize it.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to make it
another endogenous variable.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.962 align:middle line:84%
So what happens here
is the exchange rate,

00:26:11.962 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:84%
we start with the same
situation we had before.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the expected
exchange rate goes up.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the equation
it's very clear.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
The current exchange
rate immediately rises--

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
one for one, in fact.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
If I have these two
interest rate at the same.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And now I move the
expected exchange rate up,

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
then the current exchange
rate immediately jumps.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we expect the dollar
to appreciate in the future,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
then it depreciates today.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Expectations are very powerful
in financial assets in general.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the first time you come.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk a lot more
about that in the next week.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:90%
But you can see it here.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.715 align:middle line:84%
So if I move the
exchange rate today up,

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:90%
the expected exchange rate.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
It means expect the
exchange to be--

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
we know today the
dollar is $0.90--

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.810 align:middle line:90%
0.9 euros per dollar.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:12.143 align:middle line:84%
Well, suppose I expect 1 euro
per dollar in the next period.

00:27:12.143 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to
exchange rate today?

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, it jumps today to 1.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:24.605 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The dollar will be
more expensive to buy later.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
So people are--

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: OK.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
That's your friend,
the trader there.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean, though?

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.567 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:90%
It's more expensive.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But why did you want to
buy it to start with?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who cares that
something is more expensive.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:90%
You are not planning to buy it.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because the current
price or something also

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:84%
has to take into account
the future price.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: That's
what the equation says, yes.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because
it's part of it.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Because its value, at
the present moment,

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
takes into account some of
its value in the future.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: This is an
arbitrage type relationship.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I suggest is whenever
you come across an arbitrage

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
type argument, you ask the
question, well, suppose not.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Suppose this didn't happen.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:90%
What would then happen?

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.645 align:middle line:90%
What would look odd?

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Almost any arbitrary, that's a
good way of thinking about this.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The equation tells me
that the exchange rate

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:90%
has to jump right away.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:90%
But suppose not.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:90%
What goes wrong?

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's
the way, the easiest

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
way to think about any
of these asset pricing

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:90%
in general, by the way.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.123 align:middle line:90%
Well, suppose not.

00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the expected
change that goes up.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:84%
The interest rates
haven't changed.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange rate
today doesn't move.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're in a situation
with both interest rates

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the expected changes
went up by 10%, say.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And the current exchange
rate hasn't moved.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure between the two of
you, you can design this trade.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.355 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:29:20.355 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Everyone
would buy foreign bonds

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:90%
in the next period.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.825 align:middle line:84%
And no one would in
the first period.

00:29:30.825 --> 00:29:33.467 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: No, no.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.633 align:middle line:90%
But what did you do today?

00:29:35.633 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Suppose you're a trader.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And now you see, whoops,
the exchange, the dollar

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.717 align:middle line:90%
will appreciate 10%.

00:29:44.717 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:90%
The interest rates are the same.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange is
not moving today.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.305 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:29:48.305 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.905 align:middle line:90%
Which bond do you buy?

00:29:59.905 --> 00:30:03.897 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.897 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Buy a lot
of American bonds.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Of
course, because you

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
have a 10% expected capital
gain from buying that bond

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:90%
if that doesn't happen.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The two bonds are paying
the same interest rate.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And now I tell you,
well, yeah, but one

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to appreciate by
10% relative to the other.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, you go short
massively the foreign bond.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And you go very
long the US bond.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:90%
We all want to do the same.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
So it happens very quickly.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And the changes
appreciated today up

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to a point in which that
incentive is no longer there.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular case, if
the interest rate are the same,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that will happen only if the
exchange rate jumps exactly

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:84%
by the same amount as
expected appreciation of the--

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.665 align:middle line:84%
expected value of the
dollar change in the future.

00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.418 align:middle line:90%
Play with these things.

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I know it can be confusing.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I always start with
let me move something.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.858 align:middle line:84%
The equation tells
me this is what has

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:90%
to happen to the exchange rate.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, suppose that didn't
happen to the exchange rate.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, then I
clearly invest in this bond.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
This dominates the other one.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, that condition tells
you no, no, in equilibrium

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:90%
you have to be indifferent.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing you can
move is exchange rate.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange has to move
until you are indifferent

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:84%
again after you have done
some change, some argument

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:90%
on the right hand side.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you
need to think about it.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So here I'm just plotting
this relationship

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
in the space of exchange
rate in the x-axis

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and the domestic
interest rate here.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's an upward
sloping relationship.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You can see here that as I
move the interest rate up

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:90%
or the other way around.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, if I move
the interest rate up,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:90%
the exchange is going up.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's a positive
relationship.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I can do it the
other way around.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.645 align:middle line:84%
As I move the exchange rate up,
then the domestic interest rate

00:31:58.645 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:90%
has to go up.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking as parameters,
the foreign interest rate

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and the expected exchange rate.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.740 align:middle line:84%
If I take as parameter
this and that,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
then I have a
positive relationship

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:84%
between the exchange rate and
the domestic interest rate.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's going to be--

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm plotting the UIP and
covering parity condition.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Notice this point
here is interesting.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
This point tells you that when
the domestic interest rate, I,

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
International interest rate,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
then the exchange rate has to be
equal to the expected exchange

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.205 align:middle line:84%
rate, which is the
question I asked before.

00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I asked
you a question,

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.413 align:middle line:84%
let's suppose that we
start with an interest

00:32:38.413 --> 00:32:41.265 align:middle line:84%
rate that is equal to the
International interest rate.

00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:90%
What is the exchange rate?

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.728 align:middle line:84%
And you said the
answer was, well,

00:32:47.728 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it has to be equal to the
expected exchange rate.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:90%
That's that point here.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
If the interest rate, domestic
interest rate, is above that,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
the international interest
rate, then the exchange rate

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
today has to be above the
expected exchange rate

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.485 align:middle line:84%
because that will give you
a expected depreciation

00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of the currency, which will
compensate for the fact

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that the domestic bond is
paying a higher interest

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.290 align:middle line:90%
rate than international bond.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if the domestic bond
is paying a lower interest rate,

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:84%
then the exchange rate
today is very depreciated

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:84%
because you have to expect
it to appreciate in order

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
to compensate for the
interest rate differential.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But this requires
practice, I tell you.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:46.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have an equation
for the exchange rate at least.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So I can go back to my IS
equation in the open economy.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have an equation
for the exchange rate.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:90%
So I replace it.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.840 align:middle line:84%
This is nice because I
have two new parameters,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.372 align:middle line:84%
expected exchange rate and
international interest rate.

00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But now this is also a
function of the interest rate.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment, I have one
equation and two unknowns,

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:84%
really, after I solve out
for the exchange rate.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I have one equation
and two unknowns.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.790 align:middle line:84%
The two unknowns are output
and the domestic interest rate.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:90%
All the rest are parameters.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's the same situation
we're at in lecture 3 or so.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
So then we need
an extra equation.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
The extra equation was
monetary policy, the LM.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
exactly the same here.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:90%
LM is the same.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the domestic central
bank sets the interest rate.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm set.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the IS-LM
model in the open economy.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the
Mundell-Fleming model.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.935 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Mundell-Fleming model is.

00:34:44.935 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:84%
A more complicated IS with a
UIP, a driven exchange rate.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the LM is the same
as in the closed economy.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Mundell-Fleming model.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So one thing we know already, we
knew from the previous lecture,

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that we have a small
multiplier in the open economy

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
because we have the inputs that
are also responding to output.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:90%
We have a new parameter.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But now we also know that
an increase in the interest

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
rate-- so monetary policy
in the open economy--

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:90%
has two effects now.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It used to have
only this effect.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it affected
domestic investment.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So an increase in
the interest rate

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:84%
would lead to a reduction
in aggregate demand

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:90%
because investment would fall.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Remember that was the
role of the interest rate.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the way monetary policy
works in the closed economy,

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.240 align:middle line:90%
was through this channel here.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a second
channel, which is this one.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So when the interest
rate goes up,

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
it's contractionary
for two reasons.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:84%
One, for the reason we had
before, which is that investment

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.500 align:middle line:90%
falls.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is a second
reason it's contractionary.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.935 align:middle line:90%
What is that second reason?

00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:90%


00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's only here.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:90%
It's only second-- yeah.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Raise
the exchange rate.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.870 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Because
appreciates the exchange rate.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you appreciate
the exchange rate,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:90%
net exports decline.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So more domestic consumption
is diverted to foreign goods.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And less foreign demand is
allocated to our exports.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.618 align:middle line:90%
So that's the second channel.

00:36:38.618 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So in an open economy-- and
the smaller is the economy,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.188 align:middle line:84%
the more important is this
term, the more powerful

00:36:43.188 --> 00:36:43.855 align:middle line:90%
is that channel.

00:36:43.855 --> 00:36:52.342 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.342 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:84%
The US cares very little
about this effect.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.755 align:middle line:84%
Most other economies care
a lot about this effect.

00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the US is a
relatively closed economy,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the start diagram
of the Mundell-Fleming model.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So this thing here is
our old IS-LM model.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just that this IS
is a little thicker now.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It has net exports
in there and so on,

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.370 align:middle line:90%
but it looks exactly the same.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
That is, plot equilibrium in
financial and goods market,

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the combinations of output
and domestic interest

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:84%
rate that are consistent with
equilibrium in both markets.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the case here.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.923 align:middle line:84%
This is IS, which is all the
combinations of domestic output

00:37:39.923 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and domestic interest rates that
are consistent with equilibrium

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.708 align:middle line:90%
in goods market.

00:37:43.708 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the interest rate that
is consistent with equilibrium

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:90%
in financial markets.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Fed does in the US.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:54.290 align:middle line:84%
That point is where both
markets are in equilibrium.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But we can take
this interest rate.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:56.975 align:middle line:90%
So that's what will happen.

00:37:56.975 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The interest rate
will be, in the US,

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.810 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate is set
by the Fed, not by the ECB.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The Fed will set
the interest rate.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:84%
That will give us some
equilibrium output.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go
to the UIP condition,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
you see, I'm plotting
here, and figure out

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:90%
what the exchange rate is.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Because for this
interest rate here,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.640 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
some point in the UIP.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And that tells me exactly
what the exchange rate is.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So with this set of diagrams, I
can determine the interest rate

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.345 align:middle line:90%
output and exchange rate.

00:38:27.345 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So I can study the effects
of different policies,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
for example, on output, the
interest rate, of course--

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:90%
that's the policy itself--

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and the exchange rate.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.977 align:middle line:84%
So this is the new
thing I can explain.

00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I can do a little bit
of asset pricing here.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I can explain the behavior of
the exchange rate, as well.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:90%
So this diagram--

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you need to really
control very, very well.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to play
with it quite a bit.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.088 align:middle line:90%
Monetary policy.

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's do monetary policy.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We talk about monetary
policy already.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that for
whatever reason,

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the domestic economy,
domestic central bank,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:90%
decides to hike interest rate.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the economy
was overheating,

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
output was too high
relative to natural rate

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of output, the typical
reasons why you

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:90%
need to raise interest rates.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And so suppose that the
domestic interest rate goes up.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it used to be, that's
going to be contractionary.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
the exchange rate?

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know the
interest went up.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:90%
I look into my UIP.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:84%
For the high interest rate
and a current exchange rate

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%
that is above--

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that has to go up
relative to all.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
When I increase interest
rate from here to there,

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.600 align:middle line:84%
then my exchange rate
has to appreciate.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So an expansionary
domestic monetary policy

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
will lead to a contraction in
output, which is what we get out

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:90%
of a monetary policy.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But it will also lead to an
appreciation of the currency.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.135 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:40:08.135 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what we just
discussed, UIP.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:19.310 align:middle line:84%
If I move the domestic
interest rate and the rest

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
world does not follow me,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.943 align:middle line:84%
so we move interest
rates, they don't, then

00:40:23.943 --> 00:40:26.360 align:middle line:84%
now I need to compensate for
this increase in the interest

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:90%
rate differential.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And the compensation will come
through an expected capital loss

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:90%
through the currency.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So if I appreciate
more the currency,

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
since I haven't moved the
expected exchange rate,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I expect a larger loss
from the point of,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:84%
from the countries
from the currency side.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what has happened here.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's what is
behind depreciation.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
depreciation is already

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:84%
built in here, which is what
makes monetary policy more

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
powerful than the closed economy
because you get the next export

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:90%
channel.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.765 align:middle line:90%
But that's built in here.

00:41:01.765 --> 00:41:06.300 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, here all that I
did is exactly the same

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
as we were doing in
the last 30 minutes.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I just use this UIP.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:84%
For whatever domestic reason,
I need to raise interest rate.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And have contractionary
monetary policy.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
effects that you're

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.230 align:middle line:84%
going to get in an open
economy is that your currency

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.880 align:middle line:90%
will tend to appreciate.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.605 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:90%
What about fiscal policy?

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the Fed doesn't follow,
the central bank doesn't follow,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and you have an
expansionary fiscal policy,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:47.560 align:middle line:90%
then that will increase output.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It has no effect on
the interest rate.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it has absolutely
no effect on the exchange rate.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So an expansionary
fiscal policy,

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.580 align:middle line:84%
which is accommodated
by the Fed--

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that means the interest rate
is kept at the same level--

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.140 align:middle line:84%
then does not lead to an
appreciation of the currency.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't move
the exchange rate.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.767 align:middle line:84%
It no implication for
the exchange rate.

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about this
change in output?

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it larger or smaller than the
one we did in lecture 3 or 4?

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.192 align:middle line:90%


00:42:17.192 --> 00:42:18.650 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It's
going to be smaller.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Smaller.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because it's part
of the increase in [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.593 align:middle line:90%
falls on [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:23.593 --> 00:42:25.260 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Exactly because yeah,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:90%
it goes to imports.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.808 align:middle line:84%
So this is smaller than it
was in the closed economy.

00:42:29.808 --> 00:42:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has no impact
on the exchange rate.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:84%
That is, the UIP has nothing to
do with government expenditure.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
financial markets.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about expected
returns, things like that.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So unless the fiscal policy
somehow affects interest rate,

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:90%
then there is no effect.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.910 align:middle line:84%
What may happen is that, for
example, is that treasury

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.410 align:middle line:90%
becomes very expansionary.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And this output becomes
too large for what

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with a zero
output gap or no inflation.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the Fed may react
and raise interest rate.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And that will lead to inflation
of the exchange rate and so on.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why, in
practice, when countries have

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:84%
sort of expansionary
fiscal packages,

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the currency tends
to appreciate,

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is because investors
expect the Fed to react

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
to that or the central
bank to react to that

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and raise interest rates.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But if the Fed says, no, no,
we need that fiscal expansion,

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to move
the interest rate,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.377 align:middle line:84%
then the exchange
rate won't move.

00:43:32.377 --> 00:43:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's use a little
more of this model

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and look at other shocks
within this model.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with--
suppose that we increase

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:90%
the expected exchange rate.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:90%
What moves in this diagram?

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's go-- does LM move?

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
No, the LM is controlled
by domestic central bank.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't move.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Does the IS move?

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.740 align:middle line:84%
When I asked you
whether it moves,

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:90%
you should always fix something.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So you say, OK, let me
fix the interest rate,

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:90%
say, pick a point like this one.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And now I have to
ask the question,

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
output now that I have

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:90%
moved the expected exchange?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.670 align:middle line:84%
If I get the same output back,
means that IS doesn't move.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:84%
If I get a different output,
equilibrium output, then I

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.840 align:middle line:90%
know that the IS did move.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.015 align:middle line:90%
So what is the answer?

00:44:50.015 --> 00:44:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:84%
If the interest
rate doesn't move,

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
the foreign interest
doesn't move,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and expected change
rate goes up,

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
what happens to the
current exchange rate?

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
there is an opposition?

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Net exports decline.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That means that moves
the IS to the left.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So this movement will
move the IS to the left.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the first effect.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:90%
What about the UIP condition?

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Will it move or not?

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.500 align:middle line:84%
We have taken that
as a parameter.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Will it move?

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember, I give
you a clue because I said,

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
we are taking these
two as parameters here.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I move a parameter, most
likely I will move the curve.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But in which direction
will it move?

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.710 align:middle line:90%
To the right.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because for the
same interest rate,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.833 align:middle line:84%
now I need the exchange
rate to move one for one,

00:45:53.833 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the current exchange
to move one for one

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.930 align:middle line:90%
with the expected exchange rate.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So this was the
exchange rate before.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And now the expected
exchange moved to the right.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order not to
generate the expected capital

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.430 align:middle line:84%
gain or loss, I have to
move the current exchange

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:90%
rate by the same amount.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that means this curve
will shift to the right.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.560 align:middle line:84%
What if I move
foreign output down?

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Which curve moves?

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is not
a parameter here.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.250 align:middle line:90%
So this is not moving.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:90%
This is not a parameter here.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So this one is not moving.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Only one can move.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:33.390 align:middle line:90%
The IS, where?

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It would
move to the left.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.682 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: It
will move to the left

00:46:36.682 --> 00:46:38.183 align:middle line:84%
because net exports
will decline.

00:46:38.183 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, for any given level
of the interest rate,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:90%
now we have less net exports.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the IS move to
the left, so output falls.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.900 align:middle line:90%
But there is no movement here.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Unless the Fed reacts to that,
the central bank reacts to that,

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.870 align:middle line:90%
it won't happen.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:47:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.038 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it may
well be the case

00:47:02.038 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that you want to react to that.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:84%
If the whole world
goes into recession,

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:84%
the US is very likely
to lower interest rates

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
contractionary.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole world
goes into recession.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.880 align:middle line:84%
When the US goes into recession,
the rest of the world, everyone

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.920 align:middle line:84%
wants to cut interest rates
because the US is a big player.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So it really drags
everyone down.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The last one, I'm going to
repeat this in the next lecture

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:84%
is, well, what happens if I star
moves up, the foreign interest

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:90%
rate moves up?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, the LM doesn't move.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.870 align:middle line:90%
This one will move which way?

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
a parameter here.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.785 align:middle line:90%
To the right.

00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:54.403 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.403 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:90%
You said to the right.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:55.862 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So think what happened here.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.710 align:middle line:84%
If the foreign
interest rate goes,

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
up at any given interest
rate, now the domestic bond

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:90%
is doing worse than otherwise.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So I need to depreciate the
exchange rate today in order

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:90%
to expect an appreciation.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:26.025 align:middle line:84%
That means this curve
moves to the left.

00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:30.132 align:middle line:90%


00:48:30.132 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It moves to the
left because I have

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to expect an appreciation to
compensate for the interest rate

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:90%
differential.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:90%
So these will move to the left.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.535 align:middle line:90%
What about this curve here?

00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:90%
We solve it in the next lecture.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:49:03.000 align:middle line:90%
