RICARDO CABALLERO:
So after doing IS-LM

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
in the first part of
the course and where

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
we took prices completely
sticky and output was fully

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:84%
determined by
aggregate demand, we

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
said, well, that dominates
in the very, very short run.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.893 align:middle line:84%
But over time, at some point the
supply side starts showing up.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:90%
There are constraints.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
The labor market gets
very tight, and so on.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we added a block that
started from wage determination.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at the
impact of wages on prices.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we related
inflation rate.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
You start to relate
the inflation rate

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:90%
to economic activity.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So output above or below
the potential output,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
or the natural level of output
and things of that kind.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the starting point
was a wage demand equation,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
so what workers
demand for a wage.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
This period depends on
what is the price level

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.123 align:middle line:90%
they expect for the period.

00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they set the
wage today and they

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
have to live through
the year or two,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever is the contracting
period, with that nominal wage.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, if they
expect higher price level

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
in the future, they're going
to demand a higher nominal wage

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we said that's
a function that is also

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
going to be decreasing in
the level of unemployment

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
because obviously that weakens
bargaining power for workers

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
or makes actually
becoming unemployed or not

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
having a job more costly because
it's very difficult to exit out

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we made normalization,
this function, also

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
an increasing function
on this variable z,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
which captures a bunch of
labor market institutions,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
including wage labor
bargaining power.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So more bargaining power
means that for any given

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
level of unemployment,
workers would

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
tend to demand a higher wage.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the z
variable was all about.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we wanted to go
from wages to prices,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
because the ultimate goal
was to bring inflation

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:90%
into the picture.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we
had to produce--

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
we introduce a production
function because in particular,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
we made output a
function of employment.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And that, very naturally,
will connect wage pressure

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to price pressure because you
need labor to produce output.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So that the labor market is
very tight, that means also

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be more
expensive to produce output.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And we simplify this
production function a lot.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
We made it output
equal to employment.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And that meant also
that one unit of labor,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
in order to produce one
extra unit of output,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
you need one extra
unit of labor,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
which means you need to pay
a wage, one unit of the wage.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And so then we said, suppose
that the price setting

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
from the side of
the firms simply

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.293 align:middle line:84%
takes this cost, which is the
wage, and adds a markup to it

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to pay for a bunch
of other things

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
introduced in this model.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So the price charged by firms
is equal to the wage times 1

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
plus some positive numbers, 8.2
or something like that, so 1.2.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can rewrite this
price setting equation

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
as a wage, a real wage the
firms are willing to offer.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's just equal to that.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So when the markup
goes up, that means

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
the real wage firms
are willing to offer

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:90%
is lower than otherwise.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So that took us to the
concept of the natural rate

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I said,
no, there's nothing

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
natural about the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a
definition that says

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that's unemployment that results
when the price, expected price,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:90%
is equal to the actual price.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
That's all that is.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we have that
condition, then we

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:84%
can think of the real wage
demanded by workers because I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
can replace the expected
price for actual price

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:90%
and divide both sides by price.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So the actual wage
demanded by workers

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
is equal to a function of the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I stick the
end there precisely

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
because I replace expected
price or P, for no other reason.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But now we have two equations
for the real wage, the real wage

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that firms are willing to pay
and the real wage and workers

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
need to demand.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And we can make them both equal.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And that determines the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember this from the
point of view of the firm.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to 1
over 1 plus the markup.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The only endogenous variable
in the markup is a constant z.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This is also a
parameter is exogenous.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And so from here, we can
solve the natural rate

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment,
1 over 1 plus m.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And we can solve the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.513 align:middle line:84%
And if you do the
algebra right, you're

00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
going to get to a
point like that.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
That pins down the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, there is nothing
natural about the natural rate

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
It depends on a bunch of
parameters, which, for example,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
it clearly depends
on the markup.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It depends on things that we
took as constant here as given

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
here, all the things
that were in z.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Those are part of that.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And so then we look
at things that change.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
done with equations.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We look at things that
change the natural rate

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
That's one example.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.932 align:middle line:84%
If bargaining power
by workers goes up,

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
they're going to demand a higher
wage at the initial natural rate

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, that obviously,
that higher wage

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
is inconsistent with what
firms are willing to pay.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
The only way equilibrium
can be restored

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in this model, that's the
medium run equilibrium,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is for the natural
rate of unemployment

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:90%
to rise to UN prime.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.325 align:middle line:90%
Nothing natural.

00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Natural rate of unemployment
is not constant.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It depends on
institutional parameters,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:90%
such as bargaining power.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Another example is mark
ups. It depends on mark ups,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
as well, the degree of
competition, if you will,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:84%
If we are in some equilibrium
like this one and now

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
suddenly firms, for
whatever reason,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
choose or need to charge
a higher markup, that

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
means that at this
level of unemployment,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the wage that workers would
demand is higher than the wage

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.185 align:middle line:84%
that firms are willing
to pay, the real wage.

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that can
clear the market in this case

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
here, in the medium run, is for
the natural rate of unemployment

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to rise.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So here, we go two
experiments where

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
we move some parameter-- in one,
the bargaining power of workers

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and the other one the
markup of the firms.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And both increase the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The next step was
to look at things

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that happen outside the
natural rate of unemployment,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
in particular, what
happens to prices there.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So what we did is we took the--

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.798 align:middle line:84%
we went back to the model
with the expected price here.

00:07:14.798 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
That means that
unemployment that comes out

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
from this equilibrium
is not going

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to be necessarily the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
That will be the case only if
P happens to be equal to P.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Then we simplify this function,
F, here for something linear,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, but
again, decreasing

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
in unemployment, increasing in
this institutional parameter, z.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
We replace this wage
here from this expression

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:90%
here and rearrange.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
So we got this here.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And the next step was
just to go from here

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to the rate of inflation.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And we did it through several
steps and approximations.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up with what is
known as the Phillips curve.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So this says that inflation
is increasing and expected

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
inflation on this
institutional parameters.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
As the markups go up, that will
tend to increase inflation.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:84%
If bargaining power by workers
go up, then that is the same.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
it's negatively

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:90%
related to unemployment.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
that today, nowadays, you

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
know, there's lots of discussion
about the tightness in the labor

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.995 align:middle line:84%
market and whether
that's really necessary.

00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Do we need to cause a recession,
a situation where unemployment

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
goes up a lot, in order to
really finally bring down

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:90%
inflation?

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.065 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there was a question.

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember that I made
up this function.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
We said this function is
decreasing unemployment.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I just replace that
function for that.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's the sensitivity
of wage demand by workers

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to their employment rate.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Alpha is very high, it
means that wage demand

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.363 align:middle line:84%
is very sensitive, very
responsive to unemployment.

00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:06.863 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What would be the
situation for an expected price?

00:09:06.863 --> 00:09:09.196 align:middle line:84%
Like, could you connect that
back to like, I don't know,

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
some sort of a
commodity or something?

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: So what
is the intuition for this?

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just like
a price feels tactile.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But an expected price, I don't--

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Well, I mean,
imagine that workers and firms

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:84%
bargain for a wage that
will live through the year.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
You're bargaining for the
wage, nominal wage today.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't set a real wage.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
You set the nominal
wage, say $100, whatever.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the wage demand
will depend a lot

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
on what they expect inflation
to be during this period.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
If I expect inflation
to be 10%, you're

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.345 align:middle line:84%
very likely to demand
a higher nominal wage

00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
because you have to live, on
average, with higher prices.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's the role of
that, is the price.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I would prefer--

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and there are countries
where that's done--

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.058 align:middle line:84%
to set my wage in
real terms so I

00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:90%
don't need to worry about that.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, in economies
with low inflation like the US,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:90%
you don't do that.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
You get a nominal wage and
you have to live for the year

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
or until the next negotiation
for your wage contract

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.548 align:middle line:90%
with that level of wages.

00:10:09.548 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] be
dependent on time, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:84%
with the interest rate or
with the inflation rate,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
whereas I guess the regular
price is defined by the wage is

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:90%
dependent on the market?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.685 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: No,
they're both the same.

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing is that this
price here is not the current.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's what you really expect the
price to be during the year.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:84%
If this is here just because
at the moment in which you

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
set the wage, you
don't know the price

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to face as a worker.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's the price.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So you don't know the price that
you're going to actually face.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So the best you can
do is calculate, well,

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I think inflation
is going to be 10%.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So give me what I
would have had in mind

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.298 align:middle line:84%
with inflation
equal to 0 plus 5%,

00:10:53.298 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:90%
so on average, I'm about right.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the logic.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.878 align:middle line:84%
But this expected price
is meant to be your best

00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
proxy you have at the moment
in which you're bargaining

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
for your wage for what
the actual price will

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
be during the life of
that particular wage.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with that
Phillips curve here.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, this is
a decreasing function

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.922 align:middle line:84%
And then we made different
assumptions about expectations.

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
If expected inflation,
for example,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is a constant, that's when we
say expected inflation is very

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:84%
well anchored, then you
get a Phillips curve

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that looks like this, in which
inflation has a constant here

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and a decreasing on the
rate of unemployment.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And during the '60s, that
relationship sort of held fairly

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a downward
sloping relationship.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It got to be steeper and
steeper as we moved into higher

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and higher inflation levels.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, but in the
'70s, the whole thing broke

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:90%
loose.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like a
downward sloping curve here.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:90%
That happened for two reasons.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
There were some
cost push shocks.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You can think of lots
of shocks to them.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But more interestingly, expected
inflation became an anchor.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we changed the
expected inflation model

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
for rather than
being a constant,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
being some weighted
average like this.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And we said, look, during the
'70s essentially that theta was

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
equal to 1.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So expected inflation
was really--

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
whatever was
inflation last year,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
people expected that
level of inflation

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the next year,
rather than going back

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
to that whatever was the
constant or inflation target

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
or historical constant pi.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.948 align:middle line:84%
And that meant that
during that period,

00:12:43.948 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
really the Phillips
curve looked more

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
like a relationship of the
change in the inflation rate

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
as a decreasing function
of unemployment.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So that means that when you
increase unemployment here,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
you reduce the rate at which
unemployment, inflation is

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:90%
rising.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the goal of the
situation in a case

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
in which expected
inflation is an anchor.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.185 align:middle line:84%
And the last step we had
there is we replace--

00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
we noticed, we said,
well, what happens

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
if we stick in here the
natural rate of unemployment?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Then that will give us--
that will happen only

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
when expected price is
equal to actual prices.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
when inflation

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
is equal to expected
inflation, from here we

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
can solve the natural
rate of unemployment

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
as a function of these
structural parameters.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And once we have that, we could
go back to our Phillips curve

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and rewrite it in this way.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of the
Phillips curve in this way.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way we
typically write it down,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in which it says inflation is
decreasing in the unemployment

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:90%
gap.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.032 align:middle line:84%
So if the unemployment
is above the natural rate

00:13:51.032 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment, that
means inflation will tend

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
to be below expected inflation.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
If expected inflation
happens to be

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
equal to log inflation,
that means if unemployment

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is above the natural
rate of unemployment,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:90%
then inflation will be falling.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.017 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You need to know this, how
to derive these things.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not so much--

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you should
know how to derive.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But you need to understand
this relationship

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
between the unemployment
gap and inflation

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:90%
relative to expected inflation.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.277 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Could you talk about
uncut versus de-uncut inflation.

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Expected inflation.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just a statement
about a what

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is the model we have
for expected inflation.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we have the following
model for expected inflation--

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
1 minus theta--
theta is some number

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:84%
between 0 and 1-- times
a constant inflation

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
plus something that is a
function of theta times

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:90%
whatever is previous inflation.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Central banks try to set a
target for the inflation rate.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:90%
In the US it's around 2%.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, people
will tend to believe--

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
they may see an inflation
that is above, say, 2%.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But as long as people
expect that to be undone

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
in the next period,
then inflation

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
will say they are
very well anchored.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a case in
which very well anchored

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:90%
means theta equal to 0 here.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And you always stick in there,
in the case of the US, at 2%.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way the
economy is behaving right now.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Inflation today is 5%.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask people, what
do you expect inflation

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:90%
to be two years from now?

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
People tell you, look
around 2%, 2.5% or so.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
An anchor expectation is when
you don't have that anchor,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.488 align:middle line:84%
that 2% that the Fed
told you is whatever

00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
it was the previous inflation,
that's what people extrapolate

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
will be inflation
for next period.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.563 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot harder when you
get into an inflationary episode

00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
in that context.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
because you have 5%.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
People are still expecting
5% for next year.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:90%
So you need to--

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
it's much harder to
bring inflation down.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
You need to create much more
unemployment to bring inflation

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
back to the 2% target.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means to anchor.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So anchor means theta
very close to 0.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And anchor theta
very close to 1.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a formal definition.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:37.395 align:middle line:84%
We then move to what
I think is probably

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
the most important model you'll
see in this course, which

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is the IS-LM-PC, which is just
the IS-LM plus the Phillips

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:90%
curve.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to talk
about the short run, which

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is what we did in the
IS-LM and then all the way

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:90%
to the medium run.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
A medium run
understood, that's when

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
you go back to the natural rate
of unemployment, natural level

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
of output, and so on.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
We got a banking crisis there.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- This
you may find useful.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Here I was trying to
explain the banking crisis.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we have a
model for that already.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we had this x spreads
in the investment function

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, you can think
of a negative financial shock,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:84%
something like a
credit spread shock,

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
as an increase in x, and that
will shift IS to the left.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, just saying.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
IS-LM-PC model was just going
back to the IS-LM model.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to simplify
things by just assuming

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that the central bank
sets the real interest

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
rate and the real
interest rate is that.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And to that, we added
a Phillips curve.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't like
that Phillips curve

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
because we have everything
is a function of output

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
here and interest rate.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And now we have inflation
and the unemployment rate

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- yet another
variable to carry around.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So we went from the output
gap to unemployment gap

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:90%
to an output gap.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And we did that just by
noticing that the output is

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
equal to the labor force times
1 minus the unemployment rate.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, you can
define potential output

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
or the natural output
level as employment

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
times 1 minus the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Subtract these 2 and
you get that the output

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
gap is equal to minus L
times the unemployment gap.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.698 align:middle line:84%
And so we replace this for
that expression divided by L

00:18:44.698 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and we end up with
the Phillips curve

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
written in the form
of an increasing

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:90%
function of the output gap.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So when the output
gap is positive,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
then inflation will
exceed expected inflation.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
If expected inflation
is an anchor, that is,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
expected inflation is equal
to log inflation, then

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that means that
a positive output

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
gap leads to an increase in
inflation, in inflation rate.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:90%
We look at an example here.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.573 align:middle line:90%
This is the type of--

00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
now we're going to have the
real interest rate here.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.452 align:middle line:84%
Just makes it simpler to think
about central monetary policy

00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
real interest rate.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, too many
things move at once.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we
have done for quiz 1.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Here you have some particular
equilibrium, IS-LM.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
With this real interest rate,
we got some equilibrium output

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:90%
equal to y.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The contribution of
this block of the course

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
is that now we
need to also check

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
whether this is y is consistent
with potential output

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
or not, or with natural
level of output.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And that for that we need to see
whether this level of output is,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
again, is above or below
the natural rate of output.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we need to
look at the Phillips curve.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
case, that's

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
not the case because output
is above the natural rate

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:90%
of output.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You put now, given
that observation,

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
you draw here the
Phillips curve.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You know that because output
is above the natural rate

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of output, the natural level
of output, that means inflation

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:90%
is above expected inflation.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
If expected inflation
happens to be

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
an anchor equal to
pi minus one, that

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
means that at this
output gap, that there

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:90%
is an inflation that is rising.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, inflation rising means the
central bank will have to react.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
do something up here.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:90%
You need to bring output down.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And how can you
bring output down?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So this economy is engaging
in an inflationary spiral,

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
actually, given this
model of expectation.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.615 align:middle line:90%
How do you stop that?

00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:55.378 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.378 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Raise interest rates.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
If you are the Fed,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and you when-- you raise
interest rates, no?

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you need
to bring them back.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So the equilibrium
level of output,

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
you increase the real rate up to
a point in which the equilibrium

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
level of output is equal to
the natural rate of output.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And you may have to
do more than that.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
If inflation was an anchor
and you find yourself

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:84%
with 5% inflation, you may
have to temporarily actually,

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to bring inflation
back down to 2%,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:84%
you may have to overshoot,
raise interest rates a lot,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
generate a negative
output gap for a while.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And then once you reach the
level of inflation you like,

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the 2%, then you can go back
to the natural level of output.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the reason
central banks worry

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot about unanchored
expectations

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.852 align:middle line:84%
because then they know that they
find themselves on inflation

00:21:43.852 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
above their target,
it's not going

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to be enough to bring
the output gap to 0.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to
overshoot in the way down

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in order to reanchor
expectations-- well,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring inflation
back down to the target of 2%.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, even if
inflation expectation's well

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.577 align:middle line:84%
anchored, you still have
to bring output down

00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
because at the very
least, you need to close

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:90%
this positive output gap.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And that, if you are the Fed
in the US or any central bank,

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
you do it by increasing
the real interest rate.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.558 align:middle line:84%
Now, in practice,
central banks really

00:22:13.558 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
don't control the
real interest rate,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.517 align:middle line:84%
control the nominal
interest rate.

00:22:16.517 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is a little fight
there between inflation

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and what they do to the
nominal interest rate.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But let's ignore that
complication for now.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose that the Fed is in
vacation and so somebody someone

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
else decides in the
government decides that, no,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
we cannot have this very
high level of inflation.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
So what else could you do?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And you're not the Fed.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:90%
The Fed is in a vacation.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Who else can make policy?

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The government, the central
government, the Treasury, and so

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:84%
What is the
instrument they have?

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.097 align:middle line:90%
What do they need to do?

00:22:59.097 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The problem they have
is output is too high.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is leading
to lots of inflation.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.435 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
they should do?

00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:09.503 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.503 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Cut
government spending.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Cut
government spending,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
raise taxes, something
of that kind.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But you need a
fiscal contraction

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:84%
because that will
bring the IS down.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the equilibrium
output will be lower.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
alternative you have.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.205 align:middle line:90%
You should know this.

00:23:25.205 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And here I just did what we
just discussed, just in steps.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:90%
These things happen slowly.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The Fed doesn't hike interest
rates in one shot and so on.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while before you
get to the final equilibrium.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:54.384 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.384 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I showed you the
deflationary spiral.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, sometimes things can
get very complicated because you

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%
may hit the 0 lower bound.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The Fed can bring the
nominal interest rate to 0.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.715 align:middle line:84%
But if inflation is
already low, that

00:24:08.715 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
may not give you the
real interest rate

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you need in order to get output
equal to the natural rate

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:90%
of output.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Here was one
example in which you

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
need a negative real
interest rate to get output

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to be equal to the
natural rate of output.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But that may not happen because
you hit the 0 lower bound.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point, the
problem you have is that--

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and that was a tragedy
of Japan for so long--

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
is that not only you cannot
bring the interest rate,

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
the nominal interest
rate below 0,

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
but you start getting
into deflationary.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Inflation below expectation,
and the expectation

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
goes to number very
close to 0 because

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of an anchor deflationary
expectations.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.155 align:middle line:84%
Then you start getting
negative expected inflation.

00:24:51.155 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you get negative
expected inflation,

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
even if you are at the 0 lower
bound in the nominal interest

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:84%
rate, that means a positive
real interest rate.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So effectively, you are
increasing interest rate

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a very
complicated thing to get out of.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's what happened
to Japan for a long time.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
What would you do
as a government

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.475 align:middle line:84%
if you fall into a
situation like that?

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.917 align:middle line:90%
And Japan did a lot of that.

00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can do lots of things.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But in particular,
the kind of things

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:90%
you know, what would you do?

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a situation like
this in which the 0 lower bound

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is binding and inflation
is actually falling?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Here I had a benign case in
which inflation expectation

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:90%
was well anchored.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
happened to Japan.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
After they experience a long
period of deflationary forces,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.470 align:middle line:84%
then people began to expect
more deflation, more deflation,

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.405 align:middle line:90%
So what else can you do?

00:25:44.405 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hint.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Japan is one of the
countries at the highest

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:90%
levels of public debt.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you accumulate
public debt?

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you need to borrow a lot.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:90%
You have big fiscal deficit.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way
you can fight this.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You can shift IS to
the right by having

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
an expansionary fiscal policy.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
tool really have.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
You lose the power
of monetary policy

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:90%
against the 0 lower bound.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But you still have
fiscal policy.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And they did a lot
of fiscal policy.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:90%
No, not interesting.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
kind of shock.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you are at your
medium-run equilibrium

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and then all of
a sudden mark ups

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:84%
go up, perhaps, for example,
because the price of oil

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
went up a lot and
something like that.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So then that's a different kind
of shock from the previous one,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.065 align:middle line:84%
from any fiscal shock
or anything like that.

00:26:53.065 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:90%
That's an aggregate demand.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.648 align:middle line:84%
This is an aggregate
supply problem

00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing I
know of a permanent at least

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
change in m is that the
natural rate of unemployment

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.840 align:middle line:90%
has to rise.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
If the natural rate of
unemployment has to rise,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that means my Phillips
curve will shift now.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.942 align:middle line:84%
In that particular case,
I know the Phillips curve

00:27:12.942 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:90%
will shift to the left.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I know that the
natural rate of unemployment

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.800 align:middle line:84%
went up, which means that the
natural rate, natural level

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:90%
of output has to come down.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the natural level
of output coming down

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
means simply that the level
at which expected inflation

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and inflation are equal happens
at a lower level of output.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So the Phillips curve
moves to the left.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you were
in this equilibrium.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Here I'm doing for the case
of an anchor expectations.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But the same logic goes for the
case of anchor expectations.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you were at
some equilibrium like this.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
What's your medium
run equilibrium?

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But now the price of
energy goes up a lot

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and you expect that
to last for a while.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
That means the Phillips
curve moves up.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So that means that if output,
with output at this level,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.970 align:middle line:84%
now you have a problem because
you start getting inflation out

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of this, because
this level of output

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is too high relative to the
new level of the natural--

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:90%
the new natural level of output.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
positive output gap.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Positive output
gap means inflation

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:90%
above expected inflation.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
anchor expectations,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:84%
means inflation
starts rising up.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So that means the Fed now
needs to react to that

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and needs to tighten
interest rate in order

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to go to the new level of,
natural level of output.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the response to that.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
But if the Fed does not react--

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of
this is what happened.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.252 align:middle line:84%
We had some supply
shocks and so on that

00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:84%
were considered to be temporary,
well, they weren't as temporary.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:90%
So there was no reaction.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
they lasted a lot longer

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:90%
than the Fed expected.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And so now they had to catch up.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the reason
we got into a high inflation

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:90%
episode.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
That was the main
reason in Europe.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The US is a mixture of aggregate
demand, lots of fiscal policy

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And supply side in Europe was
very much a story of this kind.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, a financial
panic, you need

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
to offset it with a decline
in real interest rates.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of
that has been happening.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not the Fed that
has cut the rates,

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
but the markets have
anticipated the Fed will not

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
raise interest rates as much
as they expected before we

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:90%
got into this banking mess.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So we had already studied the
short run, the medium run.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And now we want to
look at the long run.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what economic
growth is about--

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
economic growth theory
and facts and so on.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Let me go to--

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things I highlighted

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
is that we tend to
see, among countries

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that are fairly similar along
the education and variables

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
systems, economic systems
and political systems and so

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:84%
on-- you tend to
find relationships

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.722 align:middle line:84%
like this, that is countries
with a lower per capita income

00:30:20.722 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of the sample tend

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:90%
to grow faster in the sample.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And that captures
very much the idea

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
convergence, there

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is a force towards convergence
of income per capita,

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.802 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:30:33.802 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
That's another illustration
of that phenomenon.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Lots of dispersion here.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:84%
70 years later, a
lot less dispersion.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But we also said that some
countries do not match that.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And but we focus most of what we
did in growth on understanding

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
this process, the
process of convergence

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and how it happened without
technological progress

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we spent a
little bit of a lecture,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
say at most 10 points worth
in a quiz, or seven points,

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.447 align:middle line:84%
talking about anomalies
and things like that--

00:31:08.447 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:90%
5 points or something like that.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So the key object here,
one of the key objects--

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
there are a couple--

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.215 align:middle line:84%
but one of them
was, well, now we

00:31:21.215 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
need to be a little bit more
serious about the production

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:90%
function, we said.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Because for the short run,
it's OK to take capital

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.073 align:middle line:84%
as given and just
worry about most

00:31:29.073 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
of the fluctuations
in output will

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:84%
come from fluctuations
in employment.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
That's not so over
long periods of time.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Capital accumulation
plays a huge role.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to be
explicit about the fact

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that capital matters
a lot for production.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we postulated
a production function

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:53.938 align:middle line:84%
like this, output as increasing
function of capital and labor.

00:31:53.938 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we said for
this part of the course

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.563 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to worry
about unemployment.

00:31:57.563 --> 00:31:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And so on, employment,
labor force population,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
they're are all the
same for us here,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:90%
for this part of the course.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they said this
production function

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:90%
has some important properties.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.690 align:middle line:84%
One, it has constant
returns to scale.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Things change quite a bit.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.813 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
constant returns to scale.

00:32:14.813 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have constant returns
to scale, which means--

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:90%
you should know this--

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that if you scale all output,
all inputs, all the factors

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.640 align:middle line:84%
of production by
the same factor,

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
output also rises
by the same factor.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so our production function
we use a lot was Cobb-Douglas,

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
output equals square root of
k, times square root of n.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sum of
those exponents is 1.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's a production function
with constant returns to scale.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has the exponents
add up to 1, then that's

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
a constant returns
to scale technology.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But importantly, it also has
decreasing returns with each

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
of its factors of production.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:03.620 align:middle line:84%
That means rather than moving
both factors of production up,

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:90%
you move only one.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to
increase output, but just

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.985 align:middle line:84%
keep increasing
that factor alone,

00:33:08.985 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to increase output
by less and less and less

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and less because
essentially, it has

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:84%
fewer and fewer of the
other factor of production

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that's decreasing
returns to capital or labor.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you fix the
other factor of production,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.510 align:middle line:90%
you move up.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It's going to increase
at a decreasing rate.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So one normalization
that we started with

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:84%
was, well, a scaling
factor could be

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:90%
population, 1 over population.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a scaling factor.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I do that, I multiply
everything by 1 over n.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We go into output per person
is an increasing function of--

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
an increasing function,
but at a decreasing rate--

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:90%
of capital per person.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:90%
We plot that function here.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is increasing,
but it's concave.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
That shows the decreasing
returns of capital.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.335 align:middle line:90%
And we got that function there.

00:34:04.335 --> 00:34:10.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
So when you move in this, you
can increase output per person,

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
per person by simply
increasing capital per person.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And the more you increase
capital per person,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
output will increase more and
more but at a decreasing rate.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see that moving the
distance between A and B

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the distance
between C and D. However,

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.330 align:middle line:84%
the increase in output,
when you go from A to B,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is enormous when compared
with the increase in output

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that you get from the
increase in capital

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:84%
over per person from C
to D, decreasing returns.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
There is another way of
increasing output per person,

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
which is with
technological progress,

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
with the function, F, is
shifting up over time.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And we split the two
main lectures in growth

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
into part one, which shut
down the second channel.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
important lecture

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
here, we focus on this channel.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to when I shut
down this channel for now

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and focus on the case without
technological progress first.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:90%
So we put things together.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We said this comes from
the previous lecture.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We can write output per person
as an increasing function

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:90%
of capital per person.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Second key equation is--

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
well, this is a property
and it has to be,

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
if you are in a closed
economy, no government

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
expenditure or anything.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.720 align:middle line:90%
We could add that.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's not important
for the message.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Then investment has to be equal.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So investment is going
to be very important here

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.060 align:middle line:84%
because what will make
the capital stock grow.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be
funding for that.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And the funding
come from savings.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And we simplify things by
assuming that the saving

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:84%
function is just proportional
to the level of output,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:84%
which is reasonable when
you think about long run.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:90%
All these things scale up.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:84%
When you're thinking
about very short term,

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:84%
no, we have some constants
and so on floating around.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But over the long run,
things do scale up.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.117 align:middle line:84%
And so we can write
investment in equilibrium.

00:36:21.117 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Investment has to
be equal to savings.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Saving is proportional
to output.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So we get that investment
in this economy

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.280 align:middle line:90%
is increasing in output.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a constant
somewhere between 0 and 1.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And the last key equation here
is the capital accumulation

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:37.760 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The capital accumulation
equation says that capital,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
T plus 1, is equal to capital
today, minus the depreciation--

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
some fraction of the machines
break down in every period--

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:84%
but plus the new
investment, plus It.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And we rewrote things and
replaced the saving function

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And we end up in an
expression like this

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that says capital per person
here grows with investment,

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
which is funded by savings,
which is an increasing

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
function of output, which
in turn is an increasing

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:84%
function of capital
per person, minus

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
whatever is the depreciation.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we did in the start
diagram in the other model

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is, we plot this function
and that function.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that the steady state is
when these two things are equal.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
That pins down the k star over,
k over n star of this economy.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But we also know
that to the left

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:84%
of that point in capital space,
this term is greater than that.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
capital stock is rising.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:84%
To the right we get that this
term is greater than that.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the
capital stock is falling.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
have in this diagram.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's the steady
state of the economy,

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
when the depreciation per
worker, which is the required--

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The minimum investment
you need to keep

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
the capital stock
constant is whatever

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:90%
is depreciation per worker.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.137 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you do, it will
grow the stock of capital.

00:38:06.137 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything less you do,
you're not maintaining

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.178 align:middle line:90%
enough of your capital stock.

00:38:09.178 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:90%
It's declining.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happens here.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the steady state.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:84%
If your capital below
that, then a capital stock

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
will be rising because you have
lots of savings and therefore

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.778 align:middle line:84%
lots of investment relative
to what you need in order

00:38:22.778 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the stock, the
small stock of capital you have,

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:90%
until you reach steady state.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And this model alone
can explain really

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
the pattern we have that
the poorest economies tended

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to grow faster than
the richer economies.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:84%
If you think of poorer
economies as economies

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that are otherwise similar, but
that have a low stock of capital

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to start with, well,
those economies

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:84%
are going to be to the
left of the steady state,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.418 align:middle line:84%
and therefore
they're going to tend

00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to grow at whatever is the
steady state rate of growth,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:90%
plus this catching up growth.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a very
powerful little model.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It can explain a lot of those
convergence, the convergence

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
that we saw in the data.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Then we did some experiments.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.340 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
increase the savings rate?

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.570 align:middle line:84%
At the time when Solow
was writing this model,

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
many people say that what
was behind growth was saving.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this model we
show that, indeed, it

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:90%
is a saving rate rises.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.855 align:middle line:84%
Then at any given
level of capital--

00:39:36.855 --> 00:39:38.480 align:middle line:84%
suppose that was the
oldest save state.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
If now the saving
rate rises, that

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
will increase
investment above what

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.190 align:middle line:84%
you need to maintain that
level of the stock of capital.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So the stock of capital
is going to start growing.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
output per capita

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
will grow faster than
in a steady state

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be
going from here to there.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.912 align:middle line:84%
But eventually you'll converge
to the same old rate of growth.

00:40:00.912 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So the point here is
that the saving rate

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
can not change, per se, does
not change the rate of growth

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:06.730 align:middle line:90%
in the long run.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you
transitional growth.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Asian miracle
of the very fast rates of growth

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.480 align:middle line:84%
from the '60s and '70s and
'80s has to do with this kind

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of thing-- very sudden increase
in saving rates plus other

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:90%
institutional changes and so on.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But high increase
in the savings rate

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:90%
also led to very fast growth.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, this little model
can explain a lot, as well.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It can explain when you
see those growth miracles,

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:90%
often it's associated to--

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, it varies a
lot across different scenarios--

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:84%
the saving rate
went up quite a bit.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But point is, that gives
you very fast growth

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.355 align:middle line:84%
in the short term, but
eventually peters out.

00:40:47.355 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
The next thing-- All that we did
for a fixed population and said,

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.905 align:middle line:84%
well, suppose now the
population is growing.

00:40:58.905 --> 00:41:01.510 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I said the diagram
we had before would

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.743 align:middle line:84%
be very unpleasant because all
these curves would be shifting.

00:41:05.743 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to do is
divide not by a constant.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
We need to divide by
whatever is the population

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:90%
at that point in time.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And that will give
us the same diagram

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:90%
we had with one little twist.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
a little algebra

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
here to arrive to a capital
accumulation equation, capital

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
per person equation, an
equation for the change

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in the capital per person, which
is very similar to what we had.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that the
required capital, investment

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
required to maintain the
stock of capital per person,

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.560 align:middle line:90%
has an extra term here, gN.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said that gN-- so
let's think about this term.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So delta, think of this
as the required investment

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain the
stock of capital where it was.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:84%
If this delta comes
from the fact that,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
well, you have a
stock of capital.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.685 align:middle line:90%
You lose a fraction of that.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need an investment
equal to that fraction

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that you lost in
order to maintain

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.260 align:middle line:90%
the stock of capital the same.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:90%
That's clear.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's not enough to
maintain the capital per person

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.290 align:middle line:84%
constant if per person is
rising, population is rising.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you maintain
the stock of capital constant,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.950 align:middle line:84%
the denominator is rising at
the rate of population growth.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So in order to maintain the
capital per person constant,

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you need to deal with the growth
of the denominator, as well.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And that means you need
a little-- you need also

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:84%
investment to match the
increase in population

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.820 align:middle line:84%
so they can keep the
capital per person constant.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's a modification.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.203 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of our
diagram, all that

00:42:48.203 --> 00:42:50.370 align:middle line:84%
happened here, have
technological progress, as well.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Set it to 0 for now.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.930 align:middle line:84%
All that happened relative
to the previous diagram

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is that now I rotated this
curve up, upward a little bit.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:04.210 align:middle line:84%
But then you conduct analysis
exactly the same way.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
is different now

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is that in the
previous model, we

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:84%
had that the rate of growth,
the steady state rate of growth

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:90%
was equal to 0.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And the steady state rate of
growth of output per person

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:16.985 align:middle line:90%
was also equal to 0.

00:43:16.985 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Population was not growing.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Output was not growing.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:90%
The ratio wasn't growing either.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Here it's still the case
that in a steady state,

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
output per person
is not growing.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But that also means
since population

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:84%
is growing at the
rate of gN or N,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
we call it here,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that means output must be
also growing at the rate gN.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:46.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what will keep output
per person not growing.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So for the output itself, a
very important factor in growth

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:90%
is population growth.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at rates of
growth in general in the world,

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the
developed world,

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
they are falling for
a variety of reasons.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is because
population growth is falling.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But per person, that
doesn't make a difference.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But for the level of the
rate of growth, it does.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we added
technological progress,

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:21.460 align:middle line:84%
which we modeled as
effective as enhancing labor.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So having a better technology
means is you had more workers.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So for any given
level of workers,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.360 align:middle line:84%
having a better
technology, we modeled it

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:90%
as having more workers.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can model
it exactly that way.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You can use exactly the
same diagram we had before.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.273 align:middle line:84%
But now we divide
our scaling factor

00:44:40.273 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:84%
rather than being 1
over the population,

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.250 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be 1 over
effective population,

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:90%
effective workers, 1 over AN.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And you conduct exactly
the same analysis.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You do exactly the same
approximations I did before.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:45:00.365 align:middle line:84%
But the difference now is
that here rather than have gN,

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:90%
you have AN.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, because if
I want to maintain

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the capital per effective
worker constant,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.440 align:middle line:84%
then I need to first make
up for the depreciation

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:90%
of the stock of capital.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Thus, I have to
stabilize the numerator.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.508 align:middle line:84%
But then I have to take into
account that the denominator is

00:45:20.508 --> 00:45:22.800 align:middle line:84%
growing for two reasons--
because population is growing

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and because
technology is growing.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And in order to maintain
the ratio constant,

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to add
investment so to maintain

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.503 align:middle line:90%
that ratio constant.

00:45:30.503 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reason.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Now we have this line
here, rotates even further.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And we get delta
plus gA plus gN.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.967 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And you should play
with these things.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
this diagram if I

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.990 align:middle line:90%
increase gA or stuff like that.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And notice that here, now
still you have a steady state.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's a steady
state in the space

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of output per effective
worker and capital

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
per effective worker.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.930 align:middle line:84%
That means, for example,
that these quantities are not

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.610 align:middle line:90%
growing in the steady state.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But output will be growing at
which rate in the steady state?

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In any state, state here, what
is the rate of growth of output?

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.430 align:middle line:84%
If output over AN is
constant in the steady state,

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:90%
how can that happen?

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Output has to be
growing at which rate?

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:84%
At the same rate
as the denominator.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's gA plus gN.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a trickier question.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:84%
What happens to output per
person in this steady state?

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.085 align:middle line:84%
What rate is it growing
at, output per person?

00:46:50.085 --> 00:46:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.486 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, somebody said
the right thing.

00:46:55.486 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:90%
gA, exactly.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to keep this
ratio constant.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking the question of
which space does this need

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:84%
to rise in order to maintain
this constant, while

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:84%
at the same rate
as A is growing.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Here we also did, we
ask the question, well,

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.110 align:middle line:84%
could it be that here,
if we change the saving

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.115 align:middle line:84%
rate, we get some extra
kick in the long run?

00:47:16.115 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is no for the
same logic as we had before.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
transitional growth.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.237 align:middle line:84%
But eventually you're going
to convert to a steady state.

00:47:23.237 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And the rate of
growth in the long run

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be a
function of the saving rate.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
equal to gA plus gN.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I do here.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Measuring technological
progress, blah, blah.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I told you the story of China.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:90%
We run out of time.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say the last
thing that I want to say.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So the last thing
we discussed, you

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.890 align:middle line:84%
say, well, what happen if
you add education to this

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:06.262 align:middle line:90%
and try to--

00:48:06.262 --> 00:48:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I expanded the
model a little bit.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I had education and said, does
it change conclusions a lot?

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, not really.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't change
the conclusion with respect

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:19.950 align:middle line:90%
to the long run.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It affects the level
of output per capita

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.910 align:middle line:90%
if you have more education.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But you won't achieve effective
rate of growth in the long run.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And the last point I made is
that, look, in this model,

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.947 align:middle line:84%
if you expand it and you try
to assume that technology is

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:39.030 align:middle line:84%
the same and the rate of
technological progress is

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the same across the world,
you stick those parameters

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:84%
in the model--
population growth,

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:84%
the education levels
and all that--

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.400 align:middle line:84%
then you don't explain
the amount of inequality

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.390 align:middle line:90%
we see in the world.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.190 align:middle line:84%
The world will
look a lot flatter

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
if it was just a differences in
population growth, deprivation,

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:middle line:84%
education levels,
and things like that,

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:90%
but with the same technology.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.810 align:middle line:90%
So if you want to account for--

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.300 align:middle line:84%
so this model, the
model essentially

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't produce enough
inequality in the world.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You need to add
something else that

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.460 align:middle line:84%
explains that we have some
countries in Africa that are not

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.960 align:middle line:84%
growing or growing at a
very low level of rate.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And we said that something else
technology, for whatever reason,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:84%
it happens that there is
a pocket of countries that

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.090 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a lower,
sort of permanently lower

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:31.030 align:middle line:84%
level of technology at
both level and growth rate.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what explains sort
of a subset of countries that

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.700 align:middle line:84%
are sort of stacked,
that are not

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.625 align:middle line:84%
consistent with this
convergence type thing.

00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason it's
called conditional convergence.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Those countries themselves
are converging to something.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.670 align:middle line:84%
But they're converging
to something much lower

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and with much lower
rate of growth

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.430 align:middle line:84%
than most of the
rest of the world.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But the final lesson is for the
average country, on average,

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that poorer
countries grow faster

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:90%
than richer countries.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.375 align:middle line:90%
That's a dominant force.

00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But you need a
little more if you

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:84%
want to explain certain
pockets of the world.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:23.000 align:middle line:90%
