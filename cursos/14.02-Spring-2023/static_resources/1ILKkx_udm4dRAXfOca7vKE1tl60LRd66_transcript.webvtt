00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Expectations
play a huge role in economics.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.813 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to today,
not only in asset pricing--

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, asset
pricing-- obviously,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:84%
it's all about the
future, really,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:84%
but also in the
kind of issues we

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%
have discussed
throughout the course.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
want to do, essentially,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
is I want to give you
a shortcut to think

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
about the role of expectations
in the kind of models

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:90%
we have already discussed.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.462 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to do
all that in the most

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
basic model we have discussed,
which is the IS-LM model.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you'll get the
gist of what expectations

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
can do in economics.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be a very
compressed version, adapted

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
version, of chapters 15 and 16.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of material
mapping into the book,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:90%
those are the relevant chapters.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And the main idea here
is that the IS-LM model

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:84%
as we have described
it up to now

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.405 align:middle line:90%
really overweights the present.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And in practice, expectations
about future conditions

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
play a big role in the decision
of all economic actors.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at investors,
asset pricing and so on.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's also true of consumers.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's also true of firms.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.922 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about
firms, in investment decision,

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
we made the function
of the interest rate

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:90%
on our current output.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.132 align:middle line:84%
But it's quite clear
that the reason firms

00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
invest is not because of
the current condition.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's because they anticipate
making profits in the future.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about
real expectations.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And even governments and
foreigners, when they invest,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
do foreign direct investment,
they go and invest in a country,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot about expectations
of what the country will

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.202 align:middle line:90%
do in the future.

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, political
elections, for example,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
have huge impact on asset
prices and so on precisely

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
because they change what people
think, for good or for bad,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:90%
about future conditions.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So expectations is
just huge in economics.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So we want to do
things in two steps.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The first, I'm going to
revisit the consumption

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
function and the
investment function,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
now taking into
account expectations

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and motivate how you should
really think about consumption

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and investment in a
more realistic model

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:90%
than we have been discussing.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to embed
not the fully fleshed

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
out consumption and
investment decisions,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
but the flavor of the role of
the future into the IS-LM model.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And by then, you
would have seen--

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
you will have seen all that I
wanted to communicate, at least,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
in this set of lectures.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about,
first, consumption.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And up to now, we assume that
consumption depended only

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
on disposable income, on
current disposable income.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's not really
the way it works.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first in
formulating, more or less,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
formally how consumption
decisions are really made

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:90%
is Milton Friedman.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he called it the permanent
income theory of consumption,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
meaning what really matters to
you in a consumption decision is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
not so much your
current income, but it's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
what you expect to get on
average during your lifetime.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to
be moving consumption

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%
up and down like crazy.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize, more or less,
what you'll get on average,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
then you should--
consumption should

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
be related to that concept.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, it's also
by thinking in these terms,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
you're also drawing a big
distinction between things

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that are temporary and
that shouldn't matter

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot for your
consumption decisions

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
versus things that
are permanent,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
that clearly have a potential
to have a much larger impact

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.693 align:middle line:90%
on your consumption.

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can
have temporary things

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:90%
that are very large.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you win the lottery,
that's a huge temporary shock.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But probably you're not going
to spend the whole lottery right

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.646 align:middle line:84%
You're going to smooth it over
your lifetime, in any event.

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And that actually relates to,
more or less at the same time,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Milton Friedman was at Chicago,
Franco Modigliani at MIT.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
We will develop a life-cycle
theory of consumption, which

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
says, look, even at the
level of an individual,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.633 align:middle line:84%
the day-to-day
income is not really

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
what pins down the
level of consumption,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.692 align:middle line:84%
because people
know early in life

00:04:41.692 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that they have a lower income
than they will have later on.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So they will tend to spend and
borrow more when they're young.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the
middle, when they're

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
their life cycle,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.985 align:middle line:84%
before retirement, they panic,
and you tend to save more.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So you don't
consume all you have

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because you know there are
many years ahead of you where

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
income will be lower than
your consumption needs.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is also a sense
of intertemporal smoothing

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:90%
of your consumption.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't follow income
second by second.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
You sort of try to stabilize
consumption over time,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
you have to think more

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
about your permanent income,
what you'll get on average,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:84%
rather than what you
get in the short run.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you start thinking about
consumption in those terms, what

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
really think, well,
what really matters,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
then, is total wealth
more than income.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
How wealthy you are will
pin down more or less

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the consumption you have more
than your current income.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
senses of wealth.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
One is financial wealth,
all the assets you may have,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
you may expect to
inherit or whatever,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
minus the debts you have.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So very much as we discussed
in the previous lecture

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in the context of asset
pricing, the expected present

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
discounted value
of the cash flows

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of all the assets you have,
that's your financial wealth.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
You have more financial wealth,
even if you have no income

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
today, you will probably
borrow against that wealth

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:90%
to the extent that you can.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And probably the banks will
be more willing to lend to you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
if they know that you
have a lot of wealth.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.375 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to
fund the consumption, which

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
is above your current
income just because you

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.375 align:middle line:90%
have more financial wealth.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very rich
seldom sell assets.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They borrow against those
assets to fund consumption.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
There are tax advantages
of doing that and so on.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way it works.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And the very rich often
have no income, [CHUCKLES]

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:90%
at least labor income.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
All the income comes
from returns on assets.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, they mostly
borrow against that.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.172 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
the point there

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
is that what really brings
out your consumption

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.898 align:middle line:84%
is your wealth, not the
current flow of income.

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And the other very
important concept,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
which is a bigger thing for most
individuals, is human wealth.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is huge
for all of you here.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that
your current income

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is a lot lower than what your
income will be in the future.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
You have a lot of human capital.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's also a concept
of expected present discounted

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.168 align:middle line:84%
value is you expect to earn a
lot of income in the future.

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it makes
sense that, at this stage

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:90%
of your life, you borrow.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, banks are a little bit
more reluctant of lending you

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
against your human
capital than lending you

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:90%
against your financial assets.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to borrow
against a house

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:90%
than against your future income.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But even there, probably
you're going to have sort of--

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
not going to be saving a lot
at this time of your life

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
because your income is a
lot higher in the future.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%
That we call human wealth.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And total wealth is just
a sum of financial wealth

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:90%
plus human wealth.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So at its most basic level--
and those are-- sorry,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
just to relate to things we did
in the previous two lectures,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
those are two expected
present discounted value.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't know exactly how much
income you're going to get.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.825 align:middle line:84%
You get a sense
of, more or less,

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
what somebody like you
does in the future,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
more or less on
average and so on.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:90%
So you have a sense--

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
you have an expected cash flow,
labor income flow in the future.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.947 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what the
interest rates are exactly.

00:08:19.947 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
guess, more or less, what

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:90%
the future interest rate is.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And that gives you a
sense of human wealth.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know that many of
these things you are not

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
calculating every night,
what your human wealth is,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.892 align:middle line:84%
and then calculating-- consumes
5% of that or 3.5% of that.

00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there are a lot
of-- this is very behavioral.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:90%
It's really ingrained in you.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.543 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably
more likely to spend

00:08:44.543 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:84%
more if you think that
you're going to be doing well

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:90%
in the future than not.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're too busy
now to spend a lot.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
[CHUCKLES] when

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
you're given the opportunity,
that will make a difference.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Traders, very
successful traders--

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:90%
they get a very low income.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, they live out
of the income that they get,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.610 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't afford what
they normally afford.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But they spent a lot
more than that income

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
because they expect to get a
big bonus and things like that.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the income that
comes in the future.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So in principle,
your consumption

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
should be something
that is not proportional

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
to your disposable income,
but really proportional

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
to your wealth.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are estimates of what
that proportionality factor is.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I said,
it depends on the type

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:90%
of assets we're talking about.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's about 0.03,
that kind of thing, OK?

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, in reality, that's just--

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
it's true this is a better
economic concept than just

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:90%
putting income in there.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, both
things really matter.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So a more realistic
consumption function

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
is something that
depends on both things--

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
for a variety of reasons, that
many people have no savings.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And really, we call
them hand-to-mouth.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
They live by the income they
receive in every single period.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Those people are not thinking
about smoothing consumption

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
They're consuming whatever
income they receive.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
most banks are not

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
likely to lend you a lot against
your expected present discounted

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:90%
value of labor income.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So you may be constrained
in the short run.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Your income-- you think
about how wealthy you'll be,

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.928 align:middle line:84%
but you also think
about your flows,

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:90%
the cash flow you're receiving.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
That's also part of
your considerations.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, it's a
mixture of those two things.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the micro
level at different individuals,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:90%
the composition changes.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
The richer you are, the
more this term matters,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:90%
the less this one matters.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
The poorer you are, this
term overwhelms that term.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
That's, more or
less, how it works.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But on average, it
looks like that.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't wrong
when we did IS-LM,

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
having the consumption
function as increasing

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
in disposable income.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But I always told you there is a
lot of interesting stuff hidden

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in that little C0, in the--

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
in that autonomous
component of consumption.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that-- lots of
interesting things

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.602 align:middle line:90%
has a lot to do with wealth, OK?

00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:17.458 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, this term
here is something

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that captures a lot of
things that are permanent.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one captures a lot of
cyclical components and things

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
of that kind.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So interpreted this
way, the reason--

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
people during booms, even
though human wealth may not

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
change much over
time, financial wealth

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
typically changes in a boom.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the case,
in a boom, wages are high.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
tend to spend more.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Even so, this captures a
lot the temporary component.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
boom, it's likely

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
consume more for any given

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.376 align:middle line:90%
level of wealth, OK?

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's temporary, but
that's what it is.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:90%
What about investment?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a decision by the firm.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:90%
How much physical capital?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about physical
investment, real investment, not

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:90%
financial investment.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
The decision also depend on
current, but particularly

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:90%
on expected profits.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about expected profits,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
you need to think about
interest rate as well.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We put the interest
rate, as I said,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's more
expensive to borrow

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:90%
if the interest rate is high.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
True, but actually it
matters a lot more than just

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that because it matters also
through the expected present

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.422 align:middle line:84%
discounted value of
your future cash flows.

00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:38.922 align:middle line:84%
If the interest
rates are very high,

00:12:38.922 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're expected
to remain very high,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that means a project
that gives you

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:84%
lots of return in the future,
lots of cash flow in the future,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.257 align:middle line:84%
may not be worth a lot
simply because interest rates

00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:90%
are very high.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So the discounting of the
future cash flows is very high.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And in that
environment, investments

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that give you a
return, a quick return,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:84%
are worth more than
things that have

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:90%
a pay-off in the very long run.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:07.042 align:middle line:84%
So the decision, for
example, of buying a machine

00:13:07.042 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
needs to look at the
price of the machine

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
right now and then at the
expected present discounted

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
value of the cash flows, OK?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's think a bit more
carefully about that decision.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you buy a
machine for a price.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's normalize that price to 1.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you
need to know is, well,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
how long will this
machine last because I

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
need to know for how many
years I'm going to get a cash

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:90%
flow out of these things.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And a reasonable assumption
is, for most machines,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of geometric
depreciation-- so meaning,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not deterministic.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:90%
It's more or less--

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
machines break
down occasionally,

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
but there is certain probability
that they break down.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
We typically call that
notation in economics--

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:90%
we refer to that as delta.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the depreciation
probability.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you think in
terms of expected value,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.588 align:middle line:84%
if you buy a machine today, and
you ask, how much of a machine

00:14:06.588 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll have next year,
well, it's going

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
to be a weighted average
of 0 and 1 probably.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But on average, it's
going to be 1 minus delta.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So as a machine
depreciates, the probability

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of the machine breaking
down over a year is 5%,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.898 align:middle line:90%
then 1 minus delta is 0.95, say.

00:14:22.898 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
What is the probability
that the machine is still

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:90%
producing two years from now?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, 1 minus delta squared
and so on and so forth.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing you know.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I have this machine, and
it's likely to give me

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
cash flows over this
many years and so on.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I have to know
how much expected profits

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I expect to get in
each of those years.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I need also to know
what are the interest rates that

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:84%
are likely to prevail during
the lifetime of the machine

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the
day, when I calculate,

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I do my little
project, and I need

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to decide whether 1, which was
the price of the machine or not,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:84%
is too expensive or
too cheap, I need

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
to compare it with the expected
present discounted value

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:90%
that I have for that machine.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:90%
So here is an example.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a machine that gives--
the first expected cash

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
flow comes next year.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I set it up today,
and I generate profits

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the year or at
the beginning of the next year.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
That's expected profits for the
first year of the machine, which

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
comes at the end of the first
year, discounted by an interest

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:90%
rate that I know today.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I know the interest
rate for one year.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.707 align:middle line:84%
What about the cash flow that I
expect for two years from now?

00:15:31.707 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's going to be--

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
that's expected cash flow.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
If the machine is
working properly,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that's the probability
that the machine

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:90%
lasts to the second year.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also assume that
the machine sort of breaks down

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
in little pieces every year.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:54.195 align:middle line:84%
You get 0.95 of the
machine in second year,

00:15:54.195 --> 00:16:02.888 align:middle line:84%
1 minus 1.05 squared two years
from now and so on and so forth.

00:16:02.888 --> 00:16:04.812 align:middle line:84%
But I also now, when
I think about the cash

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
flow in the second year, and
I don't know the interest rate

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
for the second year, so I need
to have an expected interest

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:90%
rate here--

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:90%
and so on, so forth, OK?

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
If the machine lasts for many,
many years, that's what I get.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:90%
A question, by the way--

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, yeah, I need to have
expectations here and so on.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.492 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that the guy
that invests in the machine

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to have that
expectation because I

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
could replace this for
something that is known today.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%
What would that be?

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, when I calculate
the expected cash flow, when

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.913 align:middle line:84%
I'm discounting the
two-years-out cash flow,

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
an interest rate

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that I know, the one from time
0 to the end of the first year.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
the interest rate

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that prevails from the end of
year one to the end of year two.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wrote here.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But I said, hm, but
there is something

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
in the market that I could
look at and that I really know.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.175 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Is it the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
I could use 1 plus r2.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:90%
These are one-year rates.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
R2t squared.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
the term structure,

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.237 align:middle line:84%
when you see all the interest
rates, a firm deciding

00:17:36.237 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:84%
whether to invest or not has
the interest rate it needs.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to have
expectations, form expectations

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
about the interest rate.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
The market is doing it for them.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the guy may
choose to be a trader

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and decide that it doesn't
like the interest rate

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.912 align:middle line:90%
that the market is pricing in.

00:17:50.912 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's a different trade.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.485 align:middle line:84%
It's not the investment
decision of the firm.

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The firm will have to make a
forecast about expected cash

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
flows and so on, but that's it,
from the machine and so on, OK?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.515 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the
larger this is,

00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going to
invest, the more machines you're

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.665 align:middle line:90%
going to buy and so on, OK?

00:18:10.665 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, a better
investment function--

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
remember, we wrote an investment
function as investment,

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
a function of output,
current output,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
which we said is a proxy
for sales, and then

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:90%
the interest rate.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.957 align:middle line:84%
Well, a better concept
is that one, which does

00:18:31.957 --> 00:18:33.165 align:middle line:90%
depend on aggregate activity.

00:18:33.165 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It depends on many things,
but not only today's,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
also the ones that you
expect for the future, OK?

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on the interest
rate, not only today's interest

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
rate, though, also in the
interest rate of the future.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:51.707 align:middle line:84%
If I look at this expression,
even if the interest rate today

00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
doesn't change, but I expect
the interest rate to change

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in the future, to
go up, that will

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:90%
lower the value of my project.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
We had no space for that when
we posted the initial investment

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:90%
But here we have that.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And sorry, and this is an
increasing function of that.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The higher is V, the higher is
the expected present discounted

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.955 align:middle line:84%
value of buying a
machine given the price,

00:19:17.955 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:90%
the larger is the investment.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is in principle.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
In practice, current cash
flows also matter a lot, OK?

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So in the same sense as in
the case of the consumption

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
function, we said, in principle,
it's only wealth that matters.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.055 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, there's
lots of consumers

00:19:35.055 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that are financially
constrained,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:90%
they're hand-to-mouth and so on.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:90%
So current income also matters.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But for firms, the
same is true because--

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and the main reason
for that, really,

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:84%
is financial
frictions, in the case

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
of the firm because a firm may
arrive with a great project

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to a bank, but the
bank may decide

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't trust
as much or is not

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
as optimistic as the
firm is and so on.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.373 align:middle line:90%
So it may not borrow--

00:20:04.373 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the firm may not
be able to borrow

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
as much as it would
want given how

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
optimistic that particular
firm is on its own project.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The bank may say,
you know, I'm going

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to be more conservative here
since I'm lending you the money.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And one way that
firms use, actually,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
to get around
financial constraints

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:90%
is simply by returning--

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
retaining their earnings,
meaning they generate a cash

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:90%
flow, and they save.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Firms save a lot, by the way.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Companies like Apple and so
on save an enormous amount

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in huge deposits, US treasuries,
and so on and so forth.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Apple, it's not
to relax financial constraints,

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
although it has
something to do with.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Being opportunistic, having
the opportunity to buy things

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:90%
that are in distress.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But many firms,
especially smaller firms,

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:84%
have deposits and
cash flow and so

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
on mostly because, if they
get a good opportunity,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:84%
they may face
financial constraints.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.135 align:middle line:84%
So if current activity
is high, sales are high,

00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:84%
firms are going to be less
likely to be financially

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:90%
constrained.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.675 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
current profits also end.

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, current profit is going
to be an increasing function

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.933 align:middle line:90%
of output over capital that--

00:21:18.933 --> 00:21:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
for any given level of
capital, if output goes up,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
generate more profit.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we can write
our investment function

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like we had
in the earlier lectures.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But now we put Vt here, Yt,
and the interest rate and--

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
interest and then future output
and future interest rates

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
enter all through
this term here.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, investment here is
increasing with respect to Vt,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's increasing
with respect to Yt.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's a far more
realistic model.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So you go back to IS-LM and
put this type of consumption

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
function and
investment functions,

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
make a lot of sense.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, the concept of something
persistent-- persistent things

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
should matter a lot more
than temporary things.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.037 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, if you expect
profits to remain high

00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
for a very long period
of time, that machine

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
is going to be worth a
lot more than if you only

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
expect the machine to be very
profitable for only one year.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that is
likely to be persistent

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.035 align:middle line:84%
is also likely to have
a much larger impact.

00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:34.708 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
There are important
exceptions, but I'm not

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:90%
going to get into that now.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And the same is true
for interest rates.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
If I expect-- since interest
rates are high today,

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
but we expect them to go
down in the near future,

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
then that's not going to
affect a lot the discounting

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:90%
of future profits.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But if interest
rates go up today,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and I expect them to remain
high for a long time,

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that's going to affect a
lot more the present value

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of profits.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's going to
depress investment a lot more.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, central banks,
much more than playing

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
with the current interest rate,
they play with your minds.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
They are always
telling you stories

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
for why interest rates
will remain high, for why--

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] they don't
want-- they want--

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
they only control
an interest rate

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that is an overnight
interest rate, really.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But they-- and with that, nobody
cares about the overnight rate

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
except for some
traders out there.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But since they want to influence
aggregate demand-- that is,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.105 align:middle line:84%
they want to influence
consumption and investment--

00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:84%
they need to convince you
that this stuff will last

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
for some time, because
otherwise it would be irrelevant

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because if you want to
reduce aggregate demand,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
you want to convince
firms and households

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and so on that the interest rate
will remain high for a while.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're going to get
very little effect out of that.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
they're having now,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:84%
actually, when the Fed is
trying to cool the economy,

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
is that they keep hiking
rates, but the loan rates

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
have begun to decline already.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's a problem for them.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They would
like you not to believe,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
bankers not to believe
that will happen.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big issue.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about this
IS-LM with expectations.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So what we said is, what
really we're after--

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
in the IS-LM model,
remember, the IS-LM model

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is a model in which aggregate
demand determines output.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in the short run.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest components
of aggregate demand,

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
aside from the government,
which is something that moves,

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:90%
more or less--

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.353 align:middle line:84%
OK, with different
behavioral functions.

00:24:42.353 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking a
lot about that here.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But the big drivers are
consumption and investment.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Those are at least the
private sector drivers

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of aggregate demand,
consumption and investment.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we have said
now is that human wealth

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is affected not only
by current income,

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but future after labor income,
future real interest rate.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:90%
That affects human wealth.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:90%
That affects consumption.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Future real dividends plus
future real interest rate

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:90%
affect the value of stocks.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
in financial wealth.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Future nominal interest rate
affect the price of bonds.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So all these rates enter here,
the price of nominal bonds.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
For firms, future
after tax profits

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:90%
affect expected present value.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Future real interest rate affect
also the suspected present

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot that says
future in this column here

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that enters into the consumption
and investment decisions

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
that we care about.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.545 align:middle line:84%
That's what I showed you
in the previous slides.

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So remember the
basic IS-LM model.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:90%
We wrote it this way.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Output was determined
by aggregate demand.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And closed economy-- forget
all that, fully sticky prices.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote consumption
as these functions.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So aggregate demand
was increasing

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
in output and
government expenditure,

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
decreasing in taxes, and
decreasing on the interest rate.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So a shortcut-- so
what I want to do now

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is give you a
shortcut to integrate

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
these views of expectations
or the concept of expectations

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.670 align:middle line:84%
into this very basic
IS-LM model, OK?

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So think of now of
aggregate demand

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:84%
rather than just being a
function of current variables,

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:84%
be also a function of the same
variables, but in the future.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So aggregate demand is
a function, as before,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
of current output, current
taxes, current interest rate,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
current expenditure,
but also function--

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and with the same signs--

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:90%
of future output.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's increasing in
expected future output.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It's decreasing in
expected future taxes.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It's decreasing in expected
future interest rate.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It's increasing in expected
future government expenditure,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
although I'm not going
to play with this here

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:84%
because of something
very specific

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.256 align:middle line:90%
that I'll discuss later on.

00:27:15.256 --> 00:27:18.065 align:middle line:90%
So that's the shortcut, OK?

00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The LM is going to be
the same as before.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you
to think about now

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is a model that is like the one
you had before with the same LM

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but now the IS is a
little bit richer.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It has more parameters-- these
are parameters-- because I'm

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.310 align:middle line:84%
going to determine
today's output,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be a
function of more parameters.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And all these parameters are
essentially the same variables

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that we worry about today,
but are the variables we

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:90%
expect of those--

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
are the values of respect for
those variables in the future

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and, again, with the same sign.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So if output-- so if
taxes go up today,

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand will decline,
and output will decline.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But if I expect future
taxes to go up as well,

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
then that's going to depress
aggregate demand even more.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the type of logic
I want you to develop.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way
our model will look.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is the IS in the
same space I had before--

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
interest rate and
output, current output.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to determine
current output.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But now I have
lots of parameters

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't have before.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I have a-- things that
shift to the left.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:84%
If taxes go up today, this
IS will shift to the left.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it will shift
to the left more or less

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:90%
than it did in lecture 3 or 4?

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we
increase taxes by 10%.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Will that reduce
output more or less

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%
than when we had the
static IS-LM model?

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.408 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Depends
on the expectation.

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: OK,
but I haven't moved.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%
These are parameters
from my curve.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't get the
right to move them.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] less.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Less, no?

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Less because now we
said it's not only

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:90%
the present that matter.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of the
present and the future.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So if-- that means that anything
that is just the present

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.810 align:middle line:84%
will matter less
than in the past.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you see that?

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we had a
two-period model,

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and I give equal weight to
the present and the future.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.643 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to cut the
effect of the present in half.

00:29:36.643 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:84%
That's-- I'm exaggerating
there, but that's, more or less,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:90%
the logic.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So you correctly said,
well, it depends on

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:84%
whether I expect the future
taxes to change or not.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
That tells you there
is a difference

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:84%
between changing
temporarily the taxes

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
taxes permanently.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Permanently here means
for the two periods.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
with this curve--

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
so we decided that
increasing taxes reduces

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
this IS to the left by a
smaller amount than in the past.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.465 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you expect
taxes to increase in the future?

00:30:16.465 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Which wealth goes down?

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Human wealth, in particular.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Your human wealth will
go down because you

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
expect your disposable income
to be taxed more in the future.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So that will also
shift IS to the left.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason that if you

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
have a permanent-- expected
permanent increase in taxes

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
today and next year,
then that gets us back

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to the type of shift
in the IS that we had

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.650 align:middle line:90%
when we had the static model.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the sum of the two.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a permanent.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So permanent changes
will behave very

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
similarly to the way
the static model worked

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
if they're permanent, OK?

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, that model
was a very good summary

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:90%
permanent changes--

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
permanent changes in taxes,
permanent changes in interest

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
rates and so on.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.995 align:middle line:84%
Changing government
expenditure, same idea--

00:31:13.995 --> 00:31:16.995 align:middle line:84%
it will also move aggregate
demand to the right.

00:31:16.995 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But will it do it
by more or less?

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, think how
government expenditure

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
worked in the basic model,
in the static model.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It increased aggregate
demand, and that then

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:90%
led to a multiplier.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And we got a lot more
income and so on.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we expect this
government expenditure

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
it to be temporary,
that multiplier also

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
will be a lot smaller because,
yes, it will increase income,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.388 align:middle line:84%
but people are not going to
spend all their income today.

00:31:49.388 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That depends on whether
they expect future income

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:90%
to also go up as well or not.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's a reason that it's--

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:84%
again, if you expect this
government expenditure to go up

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
permanently, and nothing
else changes, [CHUCKLES] then

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
you can expect income to go
up in the future as well.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you get more
or less the same effect.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.435 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a tricky
experiment because if you--

00:32:11.435 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
relevant for today.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:84%
If this government expenditure
goes up permanently,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
it's unlikely that the central
bank will remain unmoved.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you also have to
start thinking, well,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
what will the central bank do?

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.201 align:middle line:84%
And that takes me to
this variable here--

00:32:27.201 --> 00:32:28.215 align:middle line:90%
this variable here.

00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:32.758 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, before I
discuss this variable,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:84%
actually, let me point out
that it's not accidental

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that I made this curve a lot
steeper than it used to look.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this looks like
a pretty steep IS curve,

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
which is a way of saying that
a given change in interest rate

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:84%
now has a very small effect
on current output, OK?

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Much smaller than we
had in the static model.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, again, this
is permanent versus transitory.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:84%
If you spec the interest rate
to decline only for today,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, that's not going
to have a very large effect

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:90%
on consumption.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to have a very
large effect on investment.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
For the interest rate decline
to have a very lasting effect,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
a very large impact on
consumption and investment,

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:84%
it has to affect the
expected present discounted

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.100 align:middle line:90%
values in a meaningful way.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And for that, you
want those changes

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to be more or less
permanent, persistent,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that private agents think that
this change in the interest rate

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.110 align:middle line:90%
will be significant.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So if the-- so it's good
to separate the two things.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So if the Fed cuts
the interest rate

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't persuade anyone
that this rate will remain low

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.340 align:middle line:84%
in the future, then it is
going to get very small effect

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:90%
on output.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:84%
However, if we convince
people that there

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
will be future changes, that
the rates will remain lower

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, that
means that this IS now

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:90%
will shift to the right, OK?

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have here.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have distinguish which is
a movement-- when the Fed cuts

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate, you get a
small movement along the curve.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But if the Fed
persuades you that this

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
is a long-lasting
cut in interest rate,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:90%
then the IS shifts to the right.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And you recover the
power of monetary policy.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Monetary policy depends
a lot on its ability

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to convince people that things
will remain in the direction

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:90%
that they want.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:84%
If they fail-- there
was a famous episode

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.170 align:middle line:84%
in US monetary policy during
the times of Alan Greenspan.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Alan Greenspan is known as one
of the biggest central bankers

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that the US has, at
least in recent memory.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And he went through
a period which

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
was called-- was known as
the Greenspan conundrum.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
That is, the economy
was overheating.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%
He kept hiking interest rates.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
But the loan rates
kept coming down.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
So he couldn't cool
off the economy.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] There was
no way around that

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
persuade the markets that this

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:90%
would be a long-lasting effect.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
The reason was a different one.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It was not that he couldn't
persuade the market.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.137 align:middle line:84%
It happens that,
at the same time,

00:35:08.137 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
you had China sending massive
capital flows to the US.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but the point is
that the Fed had couldn't

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
move the interest
rates in the long run,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and so it was very ineffective
in terms of its monetary policy.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So again, expectations
mattered quite a bit.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.092 align:middle line:90%
So let's think about our--

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what I
was just discussing.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:90%
So monetary policy--

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I should have-- this--

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:38.180 align:middle line:84%
so you're not going to do a
lot unless you persuade people

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that interest rate will remain
low for quite some time.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And notice that
there is here this--

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:50.437 align:middle line:84%
everything comes into line
because if the Fed convinced

00:35:50.437 --> 00:35:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that the interest rate
will be lower in the future

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
as well, then you get the
IS to shift to the right.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But if interest rates
will be low in the future,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that means output will
be high in the future

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
as well, which further
shifts IS to the right.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If you convince
the markets that--

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and the markets and
consumers, households,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- that you're cutting
interest rates and that,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:84%
with that, you'll be
successful in creating a--

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.550 align:middle line:84%
getting out of a recession,
for example, in the future,

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that also increases
human wealth, expected

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:84%
present constant value of
cash flows, of profits,

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so
forth because you

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
are giving sort of better
economic conditions

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, for central
banks, it's a lot like--

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
it's mostly about
expectations management.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.865 align:middle line:84%
That's the business of
a central bank, really.

00:36:43.865 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
of you are soccer fans,

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
but there was a famous
story of Mervyn King.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Mervyn King was also one of
the biggest central bankers

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
that the UK has
had, fairly recent.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And he described-- he's British.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:90%
It's "Lord" nowadays.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And he described
good monetary policy

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:84%
very much like Maradona's goal
scored against the UK, England,

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:90%
in some World Cup.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember which one.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's essentially
Maradona picked the ball

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:90%
in his side of the field.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And he essentially drew in
a straight line to the goal

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and scored.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
But he persuaded everyone around
to move away from his path,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
successful strategy.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.835 align:middle line:84%
And central banks do a lot
of that-- lots of talking.

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:84%
[MUTTERS] And, you know,
at the end of the day,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
the true actions of
moving the interest rate

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.050 align:middle line:84%
are the least important part
of, really, a monetary policy

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:90%
strategy.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal policy can be quite
tricky here, actually.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the fiscal
contraction, a reduction

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:90%
in government expenditure--

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:84%
if you just think about the
basic IS-LM model, what happens?

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a fiscal contraction.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You reduce government
expenditure, that

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:90%
will certainly reduce output.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:84%
All the IS-LM, you reduce
government expenditure,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:90%
you shift IS to the left.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:90%
And that reduces output.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:84%
When you have
expectations, things

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:84%
are a little trickier
because it depends

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what you
expect the central bank

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:90%
to do in the future.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it expects a lot on
what the private sector--

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
how the private sector
responds to that.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you have
a fiscal contraction that

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
leads to an anticipation
of a big cut in interest

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:84%
rates in the future,
that may be expansionary.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It can offset quite a bit of
the fiscal contraction side.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, most
of the time when

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
you have episodes of
fiscal consolidation

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.900 align:middle line:84%
in environments that are
not of very high distress,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
financial crisis, and so
on, it typically sort of--

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
how successful that
is depends a lot

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:84%
on whether people
expect to be a sort

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of implicit deal between the
central bank and the Treasury.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
If people expect that that
fiscal contraction will

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.270 align:middle line:84%
come with much looser
monetary policy conditions,

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
then the fiscal contraction
is not as contractionary

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:90%
as could be otherwise.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And if, for some reason, the
fiscal deficit, the perception

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.450 align:middle line:84%
of fiscal deficit, was really
dragging the economy down

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.610 align:middle line:84%
because people didn't
know when there could

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:84%
be a financial crisis in
the near future and so on,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
then you can get a
situation in which

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
the contraction, fiscal
contraction today,

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
improves the
perception of stability

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of the country in
the future, which

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
in turn may increase
expected future income

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:90%
and be expansionary.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So most of the fiscal
contractions are contractionary.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
famous episodes

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of what are called expansionary
fiscal contractions.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the most classic
cases, best-known cases,

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:90%
is Ireland in the late '80s.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Ireland had massive
fiscal deficit.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And all they talked
about was fiscal deficits

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because they had very large
fiscal deficits relative to GDP.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And the economy was really
sort of stagnating and going

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.650 align:middle line:90%
through cycles and so on.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was all around this
fiscal deficit and so on.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So towards the late '80s, they
began a delivery plan of fiscal

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:90%
consolidation.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.377 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal consolidation
means, essentially,

00:40:41.377 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:90%
reducing the deficit.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
successful, as you can see.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But contrary to
expectations, at least,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
output growth did not
decline, actually.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.300 align:middle line:90%
They finally sort of--

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
they had a very good
period like that.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's all-- it was
all about expectations.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Notice that unemployment,
though, did go up.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So despite the fact that
you got more unemployment

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and so on, output began
to grow because firms

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
began to invest more, consumers
became more optimistic.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you see the
house household savings

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:90%
rate declined dramatically.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It is all-- consumption
and investment did that--

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:90%
consumption, investment.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
People consume more, invest
more because sort of everything

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:90%
looks a lot better.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:84%
They have been struggling
with this for very long.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And they finally-- they had
gotten that behind them.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, this example is
abused by almost anyone

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that wants to cut taxes
and things like that.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But-- sorry, by almost
anyone that wants

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to cut fiscal expenditure.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.470 align:middle line:90%
But there are experiences.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole
spectrum of experiences.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But in situations that are
as extreme as this one,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it clearly proved to
be very effective.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.930 align:middle line:90%
So let me take a stock.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So the role of this lecture
was to say something

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.987 align:middle line:84%
that I sort of should
have said earlier on,

00:42:19.987 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
but I would have
been a bit confusing.

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So I decided not to
talk too much about it.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's very important.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Expectations plays play a
central role in economics.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.505 align:middle line:84%
In particular, expectations
influence aggregate demand.

00:42:32.505 --> 00:42:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And for us, this course was
a lot about aggregate demand.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.535 align:middle line:84%
Except for the
part on growth, it

00:42:37.535 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
was a lot about
aggregate demand.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, we did talk
about expectations.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But we did talk
about expectations

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:84%
mostly in the context
of aggregate supply.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when we talk
about the Phillips curve,

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:49.550 align:middle line:84%
we did have expectations
because wage setting

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.640 align:middle line:84%
was a function of expected
prices and so on and so forth.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So we did talk about the role of
expectations in aggregate supply

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think a much
bigger role is played--

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
of expectation is really
on aggregate demand,

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.915 align:middle line:90%
and certainly on asset prices.

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But aggregate
demand asset prices

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.210 align:middle line:84%
are connected
because asset price

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is about wealth and the value
of future cash flows, which

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.760 align:middle line:84%
are, more or less, the same
drivers as for investment

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and consumption.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I want to
say that, many times when

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:middle line:84%
you find episodes of fiscal,
even sometimes monetary policy

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that are counterintuitive, it's
entirely due to the expectations

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is case of
fiscal consideration

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is not that the cutting
in fiscal expenditure

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.438 align:middle line:90%
was expansionary.

00:43:39.438 --> 00:43:39.980 align:middle line:90%
That was not.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:90%
That was contractionary.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was
overwhelmed or offset,

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:48.200 align:middle line:84%
more than offset by the
improvement in the outlook

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:90%
that you had.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And that also happens
with monetary policy.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Countries that have
high inflation problems

00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and so on sometimes get--

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and they have to go through
dramatic tightenings and so on.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.087 align:middle line:84%
Yes, most of them get very
short-lived recession.

00:44:07.087 --> 00:44:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they are
very short-lived recessions

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because eventually the
reduction of the instability

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:84%
caused by high and unstable
inflation sort of ends

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:84%
up dominating any
direct contractionary

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:90%
effect of monetary policy.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:90%
