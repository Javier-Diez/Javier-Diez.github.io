00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: OK.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's start.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So the plan for today is to
wrap up this growth theory

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:90%
section of the course.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.945 align:middle line:84%
And I want to conclude by
showing you what we can

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and cannot explain with the
models we have looked up till

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And almost as a
matter of accounting,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you, what
do we need to fill--

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
which gaps do we
need to fill in order

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
to explain the great dispersion
we see in income per capita

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.695 align:middle line:84%
But before I do that, I need
to finish the previous lecture.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And so let me do that.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I had shown you this table.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in the complete
model-- the model

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that has a productivity growth,
unemployment, and population

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
growth, we concluded
that in balanced growth,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:90%
the following happened.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if we pick
the right normalization--

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
the right normalization,
here, was effective workers.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So the productivity times
population or workers.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if we normalize
the variables by that,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
we get, obviously, zero growth.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means to have a
balanced growth, in which all

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
the relevant variables are
growing at the same rate.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So capital per effective
worker will be a steady state.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the diagram we plot.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
diagram we plot was

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
output per effective
worker against capital

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:90%
per effective worker.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And that diagram
has a steady state.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And that steady state--
at the steady state

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
or the balanced
growth point, then we

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
have that the normalized
variables grow at the rate of 0.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Capital per worker has
to grow at the rate gA

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
because capital per effective
worker is not growing.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So capital per worker will
be growing at the rate gA.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
The same applies for
output per worker.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.932 align:middle line:84%
Output per effective
worker is not growing.

00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
That's balanced growth.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But therefore, output per worker
will be growing at a rate gA.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the
exogenous drivers--

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:90%
output per worker, we assume--

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
well, sorry.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Labor is exogenous
in this model.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And so is gN.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Population growth is
some constant we take.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not something we try
to explain within the model.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But the two drivers of absolute
growth will be gA and gN.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And so capital in
the steady state

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
will be growing at
the rate gA plus gN.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Output will be growing
at the rate gA plus gN.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's balanced growth.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me give you an
example so you can do--

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
suppose that our production
function is this.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We call that the Cobb-Douglas
production function.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
K to the 1 minus
alpha AN to the alpha.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Does this function have
constant returns to scale?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the sum of
the exponents is 1.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But-- so take the
log of both sides.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The change in the log
is the rate of growth.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you get that the
rate of growth of output

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 1 minus alpha,
the rate of growth of capital,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
plus alpha times the rate of
growth of effective workers.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So in balanced
growth, gK will be

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:90%
growing at the rate gA plus gN.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
output will also be

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%
growing at the rate gA plus gN.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what
you have in the table.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to look at a
variable like this, capital

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
per worker, then
output per worker,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:90%
then you need gY minus gN.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So subtract the gN, and you
can subtract on both sides.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Then it's going
to be equal to gA.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And subtract gN from
the right-hand side.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
This one and that
one cancel, and I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:90%
get gA on the right-hand side.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way you use
that expression to fill

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
all these blanks.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:90%
That's steady state.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think I stopped
right before that--

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
this slide or at this
slide, which is--

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
if I look at this, this
table, gN is pretty easy

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to compute in most places.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
There are places in the world
where we cannot even measure

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
birth and death, so it's
difficult. But in most places,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
you can measure gN, the rate
of growth of population,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.435 align:middle line:90%
quite accurately.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And the question
we have, though,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.685 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we measure
technological progress?

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:51.895 align:middle line:84%
It's also easy to measure the
growth in the stock of capital.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's investment
minus depreciation.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But how do we measure gA, the
rate of technological progress?

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first proposal on how
to do it was also by Bob Solow.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
That was the second contribution
he had in growth theory.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was also
growth measurement.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.348 align:middle line:90%
How do we measure gA?

00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
the only way you're

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
going to have output per capita
growing over time or output

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
per person growing
over time is due to gA.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So we might as
well try to measure

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
that since it's such
an important variable

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:90%
for the growth of--

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
the growth of happiness.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
If you give one indicator of
happiness is output per worker,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
well, such an
important driver-- we

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:90%
need to be able to measure it.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And the basic idea
that Bob Solow has is,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is essentially something you
could have taken from 1401.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely simple.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It says-- there are some
assumptions behind this.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the basic
competitive model,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
you have that you can
compute the contribution

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
of each factor of production
to output by the payment

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
it receives.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So under this assumption,
suppose that you're spending,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in workers, $30,000 a year.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So that means, in a competitive
equilibrium in the labor market

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and so on, that the worker is
contributing, to production,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.658 align:middle line:90%
$30,000.

00:06:25.658 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to deal with
markups and things like that

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's the basic idea.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
You can adjust all these
formulas to include markups.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
But let me not do that.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So that also tells you that if
you increase employment by 10%,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
you're also going
to increase output

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
by 10% times whatever is the
contribution of labor to output.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I have here.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The contribution to
output of adding workers

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
that times delta N.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I can divide, by Y, both
sides, and here, multiply

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and divide by N.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get that
the rate of growth

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
in output due to a rate
of growth in employment

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
is equal to the labor share.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
labor share-- it's

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the wage bill, W times N
divided by total revenue sales

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and times the rate of growth
of a population or workers

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:90%
is the same here.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to call this gYN--

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
is the rate of growth of output
due to the rate of growth in

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
population is equal to
this labor share, which--

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call that alpha--

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:90%
times Gn

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.637 align:middle line:84%
I can do exactly the
same with capital.

00:07:59.637 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can do-- if you have
more factors of production,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
you can do the same for
each factor of production.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But in this simple example,
we have only two factors

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
of production--
labor and capital.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So I can do the
same for capital.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And I can say the
contribution of capital growth

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
to output growth is going
to be equal to the capital

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
share, which is the
complement of the labor share.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's total revenue minus the
wage payment, the wage bill,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
divided by total revenue, times
the rate of growth of capital.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So the contribution
to output growth

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of the rate of growth of
capital is 1 minus alpha,

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
which is the share of capital,
times the rate of growth

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:90%
of capital.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So that means if I sum
the contribution of labor

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and capital, I'm left with
a residual, which is--

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
whatever is the rate of
growth I have in output--

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I know how much I'm
getting from labor.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.772 align:middle line:84%
I know how much I'm
getting from capital.

00:09:02.772 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
If there is any
difference, it must

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
be due to that thing
I do not observe,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:90%
which is technological progress.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.505 align:middle line:84%
That's the logic
of all this stuff.

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:13.297 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.297 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Go back, for example, to
this production function.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, I know
the contribution

00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:90%
that K has to output growth.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I know the contribution
that N has to output growth.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only thing I'm
missing is the contribution

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
that A has to output growth,
which I don't observe,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
but I observe output growth.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I observe capital growth,
employment growth.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I can solve out what is
the technological progress--

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:90%
A growth.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And thus, it's called the
Solow residual, by the way.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way, the rate
of growth of A is measured.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The rate of growth of the output
minus the contribution to growth

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.575 align:middle line:84%
of employment,
population and capital.

00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Any question about that?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Nope?

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Somewhat?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So anyway-- so there's
a huge industry

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of measuring these kind
of things, of course.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example on
how to use this accounting.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
So China '78, 2017--

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that's an episode in which China
was growing very, very strongly.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
On average, China grew
at over 7%, output--

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
over 7%.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the formula
I showed you before,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
if I asked you the
question, well,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:90%
what was behind that growth?

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
How much was the
contribution of labor?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
How much was the
contribution of capital?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And how much was
the contribution

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:90%
of technological progress?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are several things
we can measure fairly well.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Population growth during this
period in China was around 1.7%

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:90%
per year.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive
amount of investment.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The capital stock was growing
at a rate of 9.2% per year.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And the residual-- you can
compute it using the Solow

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:90%
approach--

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:90%
is around 4.2%.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- 7.2% is a result of
the weighted average of these

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:90%
three things.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's basic
explanation of growth

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:90%
in China during that period.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, just looking at this--

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
don't look at the diagram.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:90%
What jumps immediately?

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:90%
If you just look at this part.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
What jumps to you immediately?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you differently.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Does it look like
balanced growth?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
that's balanced growth?

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, do
you think that China

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
had arrived to its steady
state, and that growth

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.025 align:middle line:84%
is a result of what was
happening in that steady state?

00:12:12.025 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But what
is it that looks--

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.095 align:middle line:84%
that tells you that that's
not the steady state?

00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Balanced growth
is when everything

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:90%
is growing at the same rate.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Meaning all the endogenous
variables are normalized,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
are growing at the same rate
as the exogenous variables.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that it would
merely jump to me here is that--

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:90%
uh-oh, 7.2%--

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that's less than the rate
of growth of capital.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there, capital
over output was rising.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's not a steady state.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I can see it in a different way.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that in a steady
state, in balanced growth,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
the rate of growth of
output and of capital

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:84%
should be the sum of the
rate of growth of population

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
plus the rate of
technological progress.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:90%
That's 5.9%.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But capital was growing
at 9.2%, not 5.9%.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So I do know that that's
a period in which.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
China was growing beyond its
steady state or balanced growth

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
rate of growth.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And I know more than that.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I know that the reason
that was happening

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
is because there
was more capital

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
accumulation than you would
expect in the steady state.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
When are you likely to
see a situation like that

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
in which capital accumulation is
faster than the rate of growth

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:84%
of capital in the steady
state and is faster

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
than the rate of
growth of output?

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
That is, that's a
period in which we

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
have transitional
growth being pulled--

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
growth above the
steady state growth

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is being pulled by
capital accumulation.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.495 align:middle line:90%
When does that happen?

00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:28.265 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:29.640 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Two things
come to mind.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
First is economies that are
transitioning from command

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.985 align:middle line:90%
market economies, I believe?

00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, the second
thing that comes to mind

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:84%
is, potentially, countries
recovering from war periods.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: OK,
that's deep answer.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something
simpler, which is--

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to say--

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
so the economy is not
in a steady state.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
That's clear.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:90%
But what do we also know?

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
We know that the capital stock
is below its steady state level.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And that could be as a result
of the things you described.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You had a war, so capital
stock was wiped out.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Or you had a period in which
saving rate was very low.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going
to a high saving rate.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] A lot of that is
what happened in Southeast Asia,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was a fast
increase in the rate--

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:90%
a sharp rise in the saving rate.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom-- so
what I had in mind

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
is for one of these
reasons, that's

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a situation where the
initial capital stock was

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.902 align:middle line:90%
below the steady state.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a period
of transitional growth

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in which the
investment rate is more

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
than you need to do to
maintain the stock of capital

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:90%
per effective worker.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a positive gap between the
green line and the red line.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what leads
to transitional growth

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:90%
until you reach a steady state.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:84%
If things do not change,
meaning population growth

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
remain the same
as in that period,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and the rate of
technological progress

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
remains the same
as in that period--

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.115 align:middle line:84%
we know that the balanced
growth rate of China is 5.9%.

00:16:12.115 --> 00:16:15.955 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's 5.9%, because
it's 0.017 plus 0.42.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.348 align:middle line:84%
So that's 7.2% average
that you are likely to see.

00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this
is an average that

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
has numbers like 15% very
early on to close to 6% or so

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
on the last stage.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:90%
So that would be a steady state.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, that, I think,
is an overestimate

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because we know that the
rate of population growth

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is declining very rapidly in
China-- is turning negative.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So for the rate of
growth of output, China--

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
unless there's a big change
in technological progress--

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.738 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
technological progress,

00:16:57.738 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be pretty
difficult for China

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to grow a lot more than
5%, I think, going forward.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And that creates some problems.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.685 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it is.

00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
model tells you.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
You need to change something.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And the things you can change
in this model are what?

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could induce
higher saving rate.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
You could get more
transitional growth out

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
of that, more
capital accumulation.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:90%
That's costly.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That means less
consumption and so on.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be some
technological breakthrough,

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but that probably would affect
the whole world, in any event.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.375 align:middle line:84%
But that's the kind
of things you expect.

00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:33.875 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So the models we
have developed here

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:84%
are quite good to explain
catching up processes,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
catching up growth,
and to understand

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
where are the economists
converging over time.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:90%
What I want to do next is--

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to end up
trying to explain--

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
remember, one of the plots
I showed you very early on

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is that there's great dispersion
in income per person, per capita

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And also, some countries are
not catching up, especially

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:90%
in Africa and so on.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to try
to understand--

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
so people have
put lots of effort

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
in trying to understand why
do we have these differences.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to
expand, a little bit,

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
the model we have to show you a
few things people have explored.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to conclude
that those things that people

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
have explored sort of
can't explain it either.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to go
back sort of to growth

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
accounting. so the sort of thing
I did for China there, and try

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to explain what seems to be
behind these big disparities

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:90%
we have in the world.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I'm
going to do is just--

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
it's useful as an
exercise, even.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to modify the
Solow model a little bit.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is like the production
function I showed you before.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
having N here, I'm

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
going to have H.
And H is just N--

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
our old N-- population,
labor force over there,

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's scale up by this
human capital factor.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So what this says is that
human capital is really--

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is the population
times something

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that controls for the level of
schooling of that population.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So a big candidate for
difference across the world

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
is certain populations are
far more educated than others.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:90%
So this does exactly that.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Size is an increasing
function of the numbers

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of years of schooling.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is a big micro
evidence-- literature

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to estimate what
is the value of that side.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
What is the value of an
extra unit of schooling

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:90%
for human capital and so on.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And the estimate depends
on what kind of schooling

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about--
primary, secondary, tertiary,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But on average, that's
a number around 0.1.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So one extra year of
schooling raises human capital

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.682 align:middle line:84%
by about 10% So the
whole population

00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
increases, the
average by one year.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
That adds about 10%
to human capital.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if you had
increased population by 10%.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:90%
So it makes a difference.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's pretty hard
to raise, for a country,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
one year of schooling
for the average.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.225 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of time.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you look in
the cross-section,

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
there is huge difference across
the world between numbers

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:90%
of years of schooling.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And that accounts for a
big part of the difference

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:90%
in income per capita.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyways-- so let me
do a balance growth

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
exercise with this
expanded model

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.703 align:middle line:90%
and see how far we can get.

00:20:57.703 --> 00:20:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to normalize
everything by effective work--

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
sorry, by workers.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.105 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to divide--

00:21:06.105 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
all the variables
I'm going to show you

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:90%
are going to be divided by N.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, notice that I'm
dividing by N, not

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
by A times N or A times H.
So there is a difference

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:90%
with the previous analysis.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And I can always divide.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:90%
The model we had--

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I can always divide by whatever
I want, all my variables.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I divide it by effective
workers because I

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have a diagram
where the curves were not

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
moving around.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But I can divide
by whatever I want.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I will divide
by different things

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:84%
depending on the analysis
I want to conduct.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that once I
divide by population only,

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
not by A times a population
and education, perhaps,

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I cannot draw my
previous diagram--

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.808 align:middle line:84%
the diagram with the saving,
with output per worker,

00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and so on, because those
curves are going to be moving,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
so it's not very friendly.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But I can divide
by whatever I want.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But I want to divide,
here, by just population.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So little h will be
simply big H divided by N.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember that big H was just
e to epsi psi u times N.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Output per worker will be just--

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
will be K capital divided
by N. And here is big

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
H divided by N,
which is little h.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So all this, now, is
measured as output per worker

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:90%
or per population--

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%
per person.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, what I
can do here is-- then I

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
know that the rate of
growth of output per person

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is going to be equal
to 1 minus alpha

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
times the rate of growth
of capital per person

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
plus alpha times the
rate of growth of A times

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
the rate of growth
of h, in which

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
h is this years of
schooling transformation.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think
about the steady state,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.465 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make any sense that--

00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:84%
gH, at some point,
will become 0.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can
increase education.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, we cannot
be all going to 150 years

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of education.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Unlike capital and
things like that--

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
you can increase, for
a while, education.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
there is a limit.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not going to do a
post post, post post, PHD, blah,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So in a steady state,
we know that eventually,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
in the long run, this
gH is equal to 0.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So this economy-- expanded to
include years of schooling--

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
has the same sort of balanced
growth characteristics

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
of the economy I just
showed you before.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So in that economy, capital per
person will grow at a rate gA,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and output per person
will grow at the rate gA.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Output will grow at
the rate gA plus gN.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So exactly the same
as we had before.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Up to now, adding human capital
doesn't change our conclusions

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
about balanced growth.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It will change some
conclusions that are important.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason I'm
introducing this variable.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't change
this conclusion.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So this model, which is a little
expansion of the previous model,

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:84%
we had, has the same balanced
growth characteristics

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as the model I
showed you before.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So let me do a little
bit of algebra with it.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So from the capital accumulation
equation, I know that--

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
so let me-- remember, the
capital accumulation--

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%
now written in per person--

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:90%
will be kt plus 1--

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:90%
this is little k--

00:24:54.110 --> 00:25:11.046 align:middle line:84%
minus kt equal to s times
yt minus delta plus m kt.

00:25:11.046 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Wait, why don't I have a delta
plus n minus plus gA there?

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember that in the previous
model I have a delta plus m

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.225 align:middle line:90%
plus gA there.

00:25:24.225 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.285 align:middle line:90%
Did I make a mistake?

00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is a
useful exercise for you.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You remember that I had a
delta plus m plus gA there, no?

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I just told you
that this economy,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
at least in balanced
growth, is exactly the same.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:90%
So did I make a mistake?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:26:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason I had the
gA there is because I

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
was looking at the change in
capital per effective worker.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking, now, at the
change in capital per worker,

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:90%
not per effective worker.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.778 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have that
A in the denominator.

00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need to account
for the rate of growth

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
of the denominator due to
an increase in technology.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.605 align:middle line:84%
And so what I can do is
divide both sides by kt--

00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that's kt.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the rate
of growth of k, no?

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the rate of growth of k.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But in a steady state,
the rate of growth of k,

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.085 align:middle line:84%
capital per worker,
is equal to what?

00:26:57.085 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
gA is the rate of
growth of technology.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So this-- in a steady
state, this is equal to gA.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And so what I wrote there is--

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I think it should
be exactly that.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, good.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And why did I do this for?

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, because now I can-- you
know that I can measure delta--

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I can measure delta.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.675 align:middle line:90%
I can measure n.

00:27:37.675 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And I can measure gA.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So this implies that
I can solve out,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:84%
in a steady state, for what
is the level of capital

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:90%
per effective worker.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I can solve from this
equation, and it's

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
equal to this expression here.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Notice a few
interesting things here.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Capital per worker--

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Each of them is divided by n,
so I can also look at big K

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
over A times big H. It's
increasing the savings rate.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
That you already had in the
model we discussed before.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
If the saving rate is
higher, then you're

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with a higher
capital per effective worker

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:90%
ratio in the steady state.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It's decreasing in
population growth.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
All these things you
already saw before.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So now that I have this
expression for K over H,

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I can go back to my
production function, to this.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's sticking there--

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:90%
this value.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I get that
output at time, t.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Once you are in the
balanced growth path,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
it's equal to A (t)
times h times k over Ah

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:90%
to 1 minus alpha.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Just solve for that.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And the point being is that
now I can write this as y(t) is

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:90%
equal to a t times--

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:84%
so human capital times
this expression here.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, human capital
doesn't affect the steady state

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
growth, but it does affect the
income per capita that you have.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And it makes a big difference.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So when people try to explain
differences across the world,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
they notice that they were
missing a big component.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And that big component
is education.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's compare.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
What I want to do next is--

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I can do this for every
country in the world.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can compare
it with the US.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.255 align:middle line:84%
OK, I can do this for
every country in the world.

00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can compare it with any
other country in the world.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But just-- let's compare it with
the largest country in the world

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:90%
in terms of output.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the US.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what we get.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take output
per capita everywhere

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and divide it by the same
expression for the US

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and then define that
variable as yi hat.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
So for country i--

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
say, Singapore-- we
take output per capita

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and we divide it by output per
capita per person in the US.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Assume-- big, if.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge, if.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But you can do that for
the US versus Singapore.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Probably is not a crazy
assumption to make.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Assume that they
have the same rate

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of technological progress and
the same technology and so on.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same rate of
technological progress--

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume
that for now.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:90%
So then this yi hat--

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:90%
you can write this--

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:02.860 align:middle line:84%
it's just this for Singapore
divided by this for the US.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.865 align:middle line:84%
It turns out to be
this expression here.

00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Solow did something
like this and said,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, assume that technology
is the same across the world

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.970 align:middle line:84%
because, at least
for major economies,

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.360 align:middle line:90%
technology can be imported.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And we can have the same--

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:84%
more or less, the same
technology across the world.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So assume that this
guy is equal to 1

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:39.632 align:middle line:84%
and that both Singapore and the
US have the same rate of growth.

00:31:39.632 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that countries
that have higher savings rate

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.065 align:middle line:90%
will tend to have--

00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:50.440 align:middle line:84%
we know that as
[INAUDIBLE] goes,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll tend to have
higher output per capita.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So Singapore has a higher
savings rate than the US.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:84%
That will tend to give Singapore
a higher income per capita.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
If a country has a
higher population growth,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
then it will tend to have
a lower income per capita

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, well, suppose

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
you make this assumption of
equal technology and take the--

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.462 align:middle line:84%
we can measure the saving
rate in different parts

00:32:21.462 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of the world, the population
rates in different parts

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're assuming that
there's the same rate

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:84%
of technological
progress everywhere.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:84%
How much of of the difference
we observe in income per capita

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
across the world can
be accounted by that?

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first question, is--

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.500 align:middle line:84%
well, suppose that
technology is the same,

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.110 align:middle line:84%
but we measure all these other
things-- saving rate, population

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:84%
growth, common rate of
technological progress,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
common depreciation across
the world, and so on.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:84%
How much can we explain
of the income disparity?

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusion
is the following.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The conclusion of that
experiment is that--

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
if the only difference
behind income per capita

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
were years of schooling--
sorry, a key thing

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:84%
that I forgot to measure
is years of schooling.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So if a country has
more years of schooling,

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:84%
it will tend to have a higher
income per capita and so on.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you try to explain the
differences in income per capita

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:84%
across the world,
using variables

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.410 align:middle line:84%
like years of
schooling, difference

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.890 align:middle line:84%
in saving rate, difference in
population growth, and so on,

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the world would be a lot more
egalitarian than it actually is.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.370 align:middle line:90%
It would look a lot flatter.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is how much
you can account.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Here, you put a bunch
of lots of countries--

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Africa and so on here.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you just stick,
in this equation,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
the corresponding saving rate,
education levels, and so on,

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:84%
the world would be
a lot more similar.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be the
kind of disparities

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:84%
we see between some African
countries and Singapore, say.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Singapore.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But the world doesn't
look like that.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you take all
these things that

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.335 align:middle line:84%
make a lot of sense--
education, saving rate, and all

00:34:11.335 --> 00:34:15.639 align:middle line:84%
that-- you're going to explain
a small share of the differences

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:84%
in income per capita
across the world.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:25.380 align:middle line:84%
In this plot here, L is
our N. L, labor, is our N.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
So this is y over N. Our
little y in this thing.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:90%
So we can get so far.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:90%
We need something else.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So what else do we need
to add to really explain

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:90%
the amount of disparity we have?

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is,
again, the Solow residual.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
assumption that As

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:90%
are the same across the world--

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:84%
that the level and
the rate of growth

00:34:54.659 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:84%
are the same around the world--
is just a very bad assumption.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The level of technology is very
different across different parts

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So the next step was
to say, OK, let's

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:84%
measure the difference in
technologies across the world.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
if you try to explain--

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.430 align:middle line:84%
so if you go out there and you
measure the level of technology

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:90%
across the world--

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:84%
different places-- Zimbabwe,
Singapore, South Korea,

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth--

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
well-- and then you plot that,
the level of technology that

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.540 align:middle line:84%
countries have, vis-a-vis their
output per capita, per worker--

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:90%
you explain a big share of it.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So here is what you
have-- is the relative A.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
relative to the US here.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:90%
So the A that we measure--

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:90%
the level of A that we measure--

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.102 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
which year was this.

00:35:54.102 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember when it was.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you measured the relative
level of technology in country

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I, relative to the US,
and then you measure

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.420 align:middle line:84%
the relative output per
capita in that country

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:90%
relative to the US--

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and forget about
everything else--

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
education and so
on and so forth--

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
you can get a pretty good
relationship between the two.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So between one half and 2/3 of
the difference in output per

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
worker across different
countries in the world can be

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
attributed to the difference
in technology level.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's a conclusion
that we have.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me revisit this
issue of convergence.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do is you
take countries that have,

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:84%
more or less, the
same A and that

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.810 align:middle line:84%
have more or less the
same levels of education.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the path
of their output per capita.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
You get that the models we
have been discussing here

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:90%
work extremely well.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So here, you see that they are,
more or less, growing together.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
There are wars and
stuff like that here.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So there are great recessions
and things like that.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But on average, you see the
countries that were behind

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:90%
caught up and so on.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Big dispersion here.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.260 align:middle line:90%
They were all growing together.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And as more time passes, the
closer they get to each other

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:90%
because they are converging.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
These guys-- the US and the
UK were already very close

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:84%
to a steady state, in the 1870s,
while Japan was way behind.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was sort of in the
same class of countries

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
in terms of technology and
in terms of education levels

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:90%
So it works pretty well.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.830 align:middle line:90%
This is for more countries.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And you plot per-capita
income in 1870--

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:84%
again, for countries that
have similar As and Ks--

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.072 align:middle line:90%
A's and h.

00:38:00.072 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
the rate of growth,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and you get exactly
what you would expect.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Countries that were
further behind caught up.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:90%
That's Japan.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Very fast rate of growth.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And you get this very
negative relationship.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
convergence model.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It works extremely well,
conditional on having the same A

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and h.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the contribution
of this lecture.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I already told you that
this convergence model

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.720 align:middle line:90%
works quite well.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The point is now that
it works very well.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And I had told you early on--

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I think in the first
lecture on growth--

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that this worked very well for
certain kinds of countries.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But then when we put
all of them together,

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:84%
there were some countries
that were clearly off.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were mostly
in Africa, but you

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:84%
had countries that had
low per capita income

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and they grew very little during
that-- the sample I showed you.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.603 align:middle line:90%
So here, I'm refining that.

00:38:47.603 --> 00:38:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, OK, now I'm going to
tell you a little bit more what

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean by countries
being similar.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean here is that
they have similar A and h.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at countries
that have similar A and h,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the models we have discussed
work extremely well.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:84%
This is over a short
period of time,

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.040 align:middle line:84%
so you have more fluctuations
and more countries.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But still-- you can argue that
Mexico and Chile probably do not

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:84%
belong with many of
these other countries,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
but you still get this
negative relationship.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:90%
It's quite clear.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.465 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't
control by A and h

00:39:22.465 --> 00:39:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and you put everything
together, then

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:84%
the plot looks like the
plot I showed you earlier.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So if I control by A and h,
the models work very well.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If I don't control for
A and h, then the models

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.832 align:middle line:90%
do not look that nice.

00:39:40.832 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So this led to a
literature, which

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is called the conditional
convergence literature.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And the idea-- it's
almost accounting,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:90%
but the idea is the following.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:90%
So the question that--

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.830 align:middle line:84%
what's behind this literature
is, well, why is it

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.660 align:middle line:90%
that we have some countries--

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
say, here-- that have a
very low income per capita

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.480 align:middle line:90%
and grow very slowly?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the puzzle.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
How can it happen
that we have that?

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And the story-- but again,
it's more accounting than

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:90%
an explanation, in my view--

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is what is called
conditional convergence.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:90%
It says for some reason--

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:84%
probably it has to
be explained in terms

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of institutions, political
instability, or whatever.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, some countries
have just lower steady state

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
levels of technology, lower
steady states because they

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
have lower technologies,
and they're

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.350 align:middle line:84%
stuck with lower
technologies and so on.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So what this literature
does-- it says,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's compute
the steady state.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's accept that
some countries will

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:90%
have lower level of technology.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.335 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:40:54.335 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at some point,
they'll flip from there.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.163 align:middle line:84%
But they have been,
for a long time,

00:40:59.163 --> 00:41:03.250 align:middle line:84%
in the stack that let's assume
that they have a different level

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.240 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So that means-- let's
compute, for each country,

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
its steady state,
its own steady state,

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:84%
using its own technology and
its own level of education.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, in this
plot, I'm going to show you-

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:90%
take the values--

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.080 align:middle line:90%
the value of A for 1970.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the plot I'm
going to show you.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The value that each
country has in 1970.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Compute the steady state
level of output corresponding

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to that A. A-- and over time, it
will be growing at gA, whatever.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
But take the A of 1970.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Compute the steady
state value of that.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Compare it with the
current output over that.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:84%
If the current
output is below that,

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that means that
this country still

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.570 align:middle line:84%
needs to catch up--
not with respect

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.820 align:middle line:84%
to some universal steady
state, but with respect

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to its own steady state,
with its lower technology

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And then look at whether
we see convergence or not.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that you start
recovering this downward sloping

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:90%
curve.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So what does this say?

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.140 align:middle line:84%
What is the big
story telling us?

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, look,
some countries,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.340 align:middle line:84%
for reasons that are
beyond this model,

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.690 align:middle line:84%
just simply have much
lower steady state.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:90%
They have lower technologies.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to use
more complicated technology.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it is.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:90%
They have lower technologies.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they have their
own steady states,

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.330 align:middle line:84%
which can be steady states
with very low levels of income

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:44.910 align:middle line:90%
per capita.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, for those countries,
it still applies--

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
this picture shows--

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that if they are not
at their steady state,

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
they still have lower
capital per effective worker

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:84%
than they need to have
in their steady state--

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that they will have
transitional growth.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So they will grow
faster than their growth

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.500 align:middle line:90%
in their own steady state.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this picture shows.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:84%
These are countries
that grew very little.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.685 align:middle line:84%
Look, we have Japan here
together with Botswana.

00:43:17.685 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they won
in the same place.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So these are countries that
still had lots of growth to do,

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:84%
relative to their
own steady state.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.228 align:middle line:90%
And they did grow a lot.

00:43:32.228 --> 00:43:33.020 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the
output I compute--

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the output I compute,
relative to the steady state

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of my
sample, was much lower than 1.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That means that you're
not at your steady state.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So this variable
here is the output

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:84%
you have at the beginning of
the sample, relative to what

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:90%
the steady state--

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.560 align:middle line:90%
your steady state is.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you compute
the steady state?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, you input the
level of technology.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.510 align:middle line:90%
You input the saving rate.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You input the population growth
and all those kind of things.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
number lower than 1.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It means you still
have catching up growth

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to do, not with respect to the
global universal steady state,

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.480 align:middle line:84%
but with respect to
your own steady state.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
see that some countries that

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.010 align:middle line:84%
are in the total sample looked
like they are not growing and so

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:90%
on and so forth.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:90%
They are growing.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:84%
They are just growing relative
to their own steady state, which

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
has little growth, and it
has low levels of technology

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the conclusion
of this conditional convergence

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out that the world
has become very unequal, also,

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:90%
along this dimension over time.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
This shows you the ratio of
GDP per worker of the 90th

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:84%
percentile to the 10th
percentile country.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you have not
only big differences

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:90%
in technology across the world.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But also, you have
very different rates

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of growth in technology
across different countries

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.540 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:05.216 align:middle line:84%
So this difference is sort of
increasing quite dramatically.

00:45:05.216 --> 00:45:06.615 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what happened here.

00:45:06.615 --> 00:45:13.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] These are the same.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So the world started with
countries-- this is telling you

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
it started with countries
that were richer than others,

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and that distance has
been rising over time that

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
towards the end, we
began to change here.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.655 align:middle line:84%
I think that has a
lot to do with China.

00:45:32.655 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:84%
That was a poor
economy that grew

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.112 align:middle line:90%
very fast during that period.

00:45:36.112 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't very large here,
so it didn't matter as much.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But then it began
to count a lot.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not completely sure.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Anyways-- but that's the
state of knowledge in this--

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:84%
obviously, there's a big
literature around all of this,

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and very complex,
even, literature.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- we
understand-- we

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:04.420 align:middle line:84%
know that we have good
ways of explaining

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:84%
how a country converges
to its own steady state,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have very poor models,
certainly, within economics.

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Or within growth
theory, per se, there

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is little institutions and stuff
like that explain some of that.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But we have very poor
models, in general,

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand what gives rise to
this big disparity in technology

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.810 align:middle line:90%
adoption and so on.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's all that I
want to say about growth.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.847 align:middle line:84%
The next topic is we're
going to open the economy.

00:46:41.847 --> 00:46:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back
to the type of models

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:84%
we had very early on, but now in
the context of an open economy.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:90%
