00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.020 align:middle line:84%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: And so
we started with something

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:84%
a little boring,
basic definitions.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
we had to do is

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to understand how do we measure
output at the aggregate level.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
understand what

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
output is at the level
of an individual factory,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
but at the aggregate level,
it's a little tricky.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we had an example
of a very simple economy

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
with two companies,
one that produces steel

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
that produces cars.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
example, the steel company

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
doesn't sell anything
to the final consumers,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
it sells all its production
to the car company.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And we ask the question, what
is the GDP of this economy?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The simplest answer would
have been, well, 300.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I summed the output
of the two companies

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
and that could be one answer.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But then I show you the
three different methods

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:90%
that that's the wrong answer.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And method 1 was--

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
a definition is GDP is the
value of final goods only.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And final goods in
this simple example

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
is, well, this company
is not producing anything

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
as a final good because all its
sales are going to-- as an input

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
into other companies'
production.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this one
doesn't count at all

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
in our simple example,
this one counts,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and then the answer is $200.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Not 300, but $200.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Method 2 was to count only the
value added in each company.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And value added
is the difference

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
between the final output--

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that is, the revenue from sales,
minus whatever that company

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:90%
spends on intermediate inputs.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
In this simple
example, this company--

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
the steel company is
not spending anything

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:90%
on intermediate inputs--

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
it's a strange production
of steel, but anyways,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:90%
it is quite a decent example.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this $100 is value-added,
completely value-added.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
There is no expenses
on intermediate inputs.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
For the car company, however,
the revenue from sales is 200,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
but the company spends 100
on intermediate inputs.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the value
added of this company

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
is 200 negative 100, so
you get 100 value added

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
from this one, 100 of
value added from that one,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:90%
total value added, 200.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:90%
So same answer.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And the third method--

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
these are-- the two methods
that I just described

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
are production methods.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
You're measuring
the production side.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
The alternative is to
look at the income side.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And the income side says just--
let's sum all the incomes

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
in the economy.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And the incomes are income
to workers, wages, and income

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
to the owners of
capital, profits.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Income to workers is
$80 plus 70, is 150.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Income to owners of capital
is 20 plus 30, that's 50.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:90%
So 150 plus 50 is, again, 200.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So these are three equivalent
ways of measuring output.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- one of the features
I show you of this method

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is that they are immune to
organizational structure

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:90%
within the economy.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if these
two companies were to merge,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:84%
clearly the sum of
incomes would not change.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:90%
It would still be 100--

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:90%
it would be 200.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
This one would not change
because if they were to merge,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
then the whole production of the
revenues from sales of the car

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.377 align:middle line:90%
company would be value-added.

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything would be
produced in-house,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and still, the
answer would be 200,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
then, because this
company would disappear,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
it would emerge inside here,
and you would get still get 200.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And the same happened with
method 1 because still,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the sales of final
goods is only 200.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
The naive approach of
just summing output

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
would be terrible because
once you merge it,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
output would collapse
from 300 to 200.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
That tells you that's not the
right way of doing things.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So while the three methods
we propose do work,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
are immune to this
organization-- changes

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:90%
in the organization structure.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The next step was to highlight
that when we say output,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:90%
we're really after real output.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is a distinction
between nominal output

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and real output.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Nominal output is
simply the quantity

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of final goods measured
at current prices,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
while real output is measured at
some fixed set of prices of one

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
fixed year.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think I gave
you an example.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
This is an example I gave
you, and then in the P-sets,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
you had more complicated
examples with multiple goods.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, you have an economy that
produces only one good, cars,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and that produces 10 cars
here, 12 cars, 13 cars here.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The price of the cars is
rising, so the nominal GDP

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is rising a lot while the
real GDP is rising less.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:90%
How do we measure real GDP here?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We use-- in this particular
example, we use the prices here,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
12--

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
10 times the price of the car
in 2012 is 24,000, that's 240.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Obviously for the
base year, nominal GDP

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
is the same as real GDP.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And then for 2013 is 13--

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:84%
not times 26,000, but times
24,000 and we get that.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Now in this particular
example of only one good,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
you can pick any
base year and you'll

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
get exactly the same rate
of growth of real output.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have multiple
goods, that's not true

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because the relative prices
of goods are moving over time,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:90%
but that's the basic idea.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.988 align:middle line:84%
So-- I mean, again, you
should know these things--

00:05:56.988 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be tremendously
important in the quiz,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.755 align:middle line:84%
but they will show
up in your quiz.

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we went through
some definitions.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
The unemployment
rate being the number

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of unemployed over the
labor force, not population,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:90%
that's important.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.815 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
inflation rate as well.

00:06:19.815 --> 00:06:21.703 align:middle line:84%
And that's the rate
of change of prices,

00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and there are different
prices in the economy.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
deflator, the other one

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
is CPI, and so on and so forth.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.513 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first lecture
relevant for the quiz.

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:33.555 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about that?

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, then we move to--

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
then we began to
really get serious

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.755 align:middle line:84%
because we began to construct a
foundation for the IS-LM model.

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:51.255 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing we did is
we looked at the goods market.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we did
here is we said--

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
we describe the different
components of aggregate demand,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.793 align:middle line:84%
and we said, in this
economy-- for now, at least,

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make
this economy closed,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
so we remove exports and
imports, and for your quiz,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
absolutely you're not
going to see anything

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
about exports or imports.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is your
aggregate demand.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to build
a little more,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
so we had to have some
behavioral assumptions.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We made it initially
very simple.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
We assume this was exogenous,
that government expenditure was

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:90%
exogenous.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Taxes were also exogenous.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And the only behavioral
equation we had

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
was this consumption
function, and we

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
said consumption is
increasing disposable income.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So we assume something
linear like this.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Disposable income is
just income minus taxes.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And remember, income-- remember
from the alternative ways

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
of measuring GDP, income
is the same as output.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.157 align:middle line:84%
So when I say income,
because that's what

00:07:57.157 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is relevant for the
consumption-- consumers world,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:90%
but it's the same as output.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So that was our
consumption function.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.242 align:middle line:84%
it had an
upward-sloping-- it was

00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
upward-sloping because there
is a marginal propensity

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:90%
to consume, c1.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And then a key assumption
of this part of the course

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
is that output is aggregate
demand-determined.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Prices were completely
fixed, and we said, well,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
but output is whatever demand
wants, that's what output is.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
equilibrium condition.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the aggregate demand,
this is an equilibrium

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
condition, so we can
solve out because I

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
can say in equilibrium,
z is equal to y,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:84%
and I can solve for equilibrium
output from that equation.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we did in this slide,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and you got to an
expression like this.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Knowing how to do that is
very important for you.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So you better be sure that
how to find equilibrium output

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.595 align:middle line:90%
in this model.

00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going to be
very difficult to do IS-LM

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know these steps,
so you better know this stuff.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And remember something--
we call this guy

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
here in the simple
economy the multiplier.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Why the multiplier?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, because given
certain something

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
we call exogenous expenditure,
the 1 minus c1 multiplies that.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.565 align:middle line:84%
If the marginal propensity
to consume is very high--

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
say it's close to 1, then the
multiplier is very, very high.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
If the marginal propensity
to consume, say, is 0.5, then

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:90%
how much is the multiplier?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So the multiplier is 2.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And that was our equilibrium.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:90%
We had the aggregate demand.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
The slope was less than the
45-degree line because c1 is

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
a number less than 1, and so
you have some equilibrium output

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the equilibrium output.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
At this point, aggregate
demand is equal to--

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
well, aggregate demand is equal
to aggregate supply, that's

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
always true, but
that's consistent also

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:90%
with aggregate demand--

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
with the function
of aggregate demand.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And important for this
equilibrium output

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the equilibrium output
is a function of a lot of things

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that we took as parameters in
this aggregate demand curve.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.673 align:middle line:84%
What did we take as parameters
in the aggregate demand curve?

00:10:17.673 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Just give me examples.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, investment, government
expenditure, and taxes

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
at the very least.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Also, parameters like autonomous
consumption, that c0 we're

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:90%
taking as given.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Anything-- if any of
those things move,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
the position of the aggregate
demand curve will shift around.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And that was one example.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Suppose autonomous
consumption c0 goes up.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly consumers
decide to spend more.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, then what we have is
that aggregate demand shift up

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and equilibrium output
ends up changing

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
by more than the
initial change in c0.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is the change in c0,
but the change in output--

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and so the initial
change c0 leads

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to an initial change in
output, which is equal to c0.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
That's up to here.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But then we end up with a final
equilibrium output is higher

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:90%
than the initial response.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
All this happens infinitely
fast in this model.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Why is this change
greater than c0?

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
There is a multiplier in front.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We change c0 by 1, but then you
have to multiply it by 1 over 1

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:90%
minus c1.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we illustrated
in this picture there.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you should
move everything--

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%
you can move here around.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Move G up, D up, and stuff
like that and see what happens.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I
did in this section

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
is I showed you an alternative
way-- entirely equivalent way

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of illustrating
equilibrium, which

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
was saving equal to investment.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I derived this, and I
go to an expression like that.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the same
as aggregate demand

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:90%
equal to aggregate supply.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
An investment, which, in
this particular basic model,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
is fixed, is equal to saving by
the government, which is also,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
in this basic model,
is fixed because it's

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
G minus T, which is fixed.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, it's T minus
G, which is fixed.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And then private saving.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I show you
an interesting result,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
which is called-- known
the paradox of savings,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:90%
which says the following.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
If, for whatever reason,
consumers decide to save more,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
say, for example, because
c0 now comes down.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So now they have certain income.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Out of that same income,
they want to save more.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Then from this very
simple equation,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I know that-- what
happens to output?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.466 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because savings go
up, consumer demand goes down.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then also, investments
will also go down.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.868 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: No.

00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Investment doesn't go down
here because it's fixed.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:84%
In this basic
example, not IS-LM.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
RICHARDO CABALLERO:
Yes, but that's

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
an explanation, which is
the right explanation,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but the explanation in the outer
space, output and the income.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted in the space of
saving and investment.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me give it
to you very quickly.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.932 align:middle line:84%
But your answer is
correct, but it's not

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
what I wanted here because
what I wanted to say

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
is the following.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
If, for whatever reason, for
any given level of income,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
savings go up, then
we have an imbalance.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Total saving is greater
than investment.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The only variable
that can adjust here--

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
so we restore equilibrium,
investment equal to savings,

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is for the output to come down
because if output comes down,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
savings come down, and that's
the way you restore equilibrium.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I told you, this way
of looking at things

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:84%
is entirely equivalent
as we have already done.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So I can also do what
you wanted to do,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
which is represent that in
the space of output and--

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand and aggregate--
and output or income.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And an increase in c0--

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
a reduction in c0 would lead to
a decline in aggregate demand

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and then through the multiplier
larger increase in output.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.982 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way
we characterize it

00:14:25.982 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:84%
before, this is a slightly
different way of characterizing

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.032 align:middle line:84%
which is what gives rise to what
is called the paradox of savings

00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly you
decide to save more,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:90%
supposedly that should be good.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the short-run
it's not really good,

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:90%
it causes a recession.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Anyways.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It's cute, but it may
show up in your future,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:90%
so I wanted to remind you.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
goods market side.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at
financial markets

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and we trivialize
financial markets, really.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We said let's assume the
financial markets are very, very

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:90%
simple.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Money and bonds.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And the first behavior--

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the only behavioral
equation we really had here

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
was money demand,
and we said, well,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
money demand is
increasing in nominal GDP

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
because if nominal
GDP is larger,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
then you need to do
more transactions,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:90%
you need more money, more cash.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Cash of deposit, but here,
we're looking only at cash.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.273 align:middle line:84%
But it's decreasing
in the interest rate.

00:15:42.273 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Money-- the money is
decreasing in-- why is it

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:90%
decreasing in interest rate?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.123 align:middle line:84%
Interest rate is the
return on the bonds.

00:15:49.123 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Why is money demand decreasing
in the interest rate?

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity cost of holding
cash in your pocket is higher.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
You didn't care about
this stuff a year ago.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But now, it costs
you 5% to hold cash.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what you get in
1-year certificate bond.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:90%
US Treasury bond at this moment.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's more significant.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not that relevant
for you, but corporation,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.893 align:middle line:84%
makes a big difference,
I guarantee you.

00:16:22.893 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm keeping the thing
in the checking account,

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
now they're really buying
short-term Treasuries and stuff

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
this is downward-sloping.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's the concept here.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So then what the central
bank controls is money.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
How much money it injects in
the economy, that is how much--

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
How much money it injects
into the economy, how does--

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:90%
let me say just that for now.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the money supply.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So the equilibrium
interest rate is simply

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
the point in which money demand
is equal to the money exogenous

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
money supply.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said in the modern world,
the central banks don't tell you

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
M S. They tell you this is
the interest rate we want,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and then they provide
whatever M they need in order

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to get the interest rate they
have told you they want to have.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's the case of an
expansionary monetary policy.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the Fed wants to lower
the interest rate from here

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it needs to
do is increase money.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And increase money means it
goes out there, an open market

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
operation, and buys bonds
from the private sector.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Buys bonds, takes bonds
in, and gives them cash.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Money.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.692 align:middle line:84%
That's an expansionary
monetary policy,

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and an expansionary
monetary policy

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:90%
will lower the interest rate.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:90%
That's an open market operation.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we just
saw, was exactly that.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The Fed wants to lower
the interest rate.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
What it does is
it goes out there,

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
it buys bonds from
the private sector

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
so it's balance sheet on the
asset side has more bonds now,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
but it has more liabilities
because it gives cash to people

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's a liability
of the central banks.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's an open
market operation.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
That's an expansionary
open market operation

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
which is designed to
lower the interest rate.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Then I talked about
the relationship

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:84%
between the interest rate
and the price of the bond.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's the return on a bond.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the face value
of the bond, what

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:90%
you get when the bond matures.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Say it's 100, it's a
bond for 100, minus

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever you pay divided
by whatever you pay.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So say if you pay
today $95 for a bond

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.505 align:middle line:84%
that will pay you $100 a year
from now, that's approximately--

00:18:49.505 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:90%
it's 5% interest rate.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more,
but that's about it.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Which also helps you
understand a little bit what

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
happens during an
open market operation.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
In an open market operation, an
expansionary monetary policy,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:84%
the central bank goes
out there and buys bonds.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
What typically happens
to a price of a good

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
or an asset that is being
bought by somebody big?

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.333 align:middle line:90%
Goes up or down?

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a big buyer out
there that goes and buys bond.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the price of
bonds will go up or down?

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Up.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Big buyer got into the market
to buy bonds, the price of bonds

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
go up.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But if the price
of bonds goes up,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that means the interest
rate goes down.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's an intuitive
way of understanding

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
how monetary policy
lowers interest rates.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a big buyer buying bonds,
the price of bonds will go up,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
but the interest rate
and the price of the bond

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:90%
are inversely related.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Now suppose that the initial
price of the bond was 95,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and now the price of
the bond goes to 100,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate goes from
a little more than 5% to 0%.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Then we talked about
intermediaries.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Forget it for now.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So then we got into two
lectures about IS-LM--

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
about the basic
IS-LM model, and then

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:84%
we did one more on the
extended IS-LM model.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I told you that at least
two-thirds of your quiz

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:90%
will be about this.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So-- and I already know what is
in the quiz and I cannot tell

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:90%
you, that I honor my commitment.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So you better understand the
IS-LM model very, very well.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Now understanding
the IS-LM model also

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
means understanding
the previous two

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
lectures because we're
building the IS-LM model there.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we did here is

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.038 align:middle line:84%
we said, well, to make
this stuff a little more

00:20:51.038 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- we already
had a model in which we

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
could find equilibrium output.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that was in
lecture 3, we had that.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But we said-- but we took
many things as exogenous there

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that are really not
exogenous in practice.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
In particular,
private investment.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Private investment is
certainly something

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
that responds to
aggregate activity

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and to the cost of borrowing
and things of that nature.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So what we did-- the
first thing we did here

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
is we changed the
investment function

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
for some constant for something
that was a function of output

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:90%
and the interest rate.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
That component here, the fact
that it was increasing in output

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
just increase the multiplier,
but it didn't change anything

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:90%
qualitatively in the analysis.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that it
depends on the interest rate

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is important because now we have
as a parameter in the goods--

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in the aggregate demand
curve the interest rate.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.802 align:middle line:84%
When you solve out
the whole thing,

00:21:45.802 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate is one
of the things that can

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:90%
move aggregate demand around.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.657 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
because now you

00:21:51.657 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
can begin to see the
connection between what

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the central bank does and how
it affects aggregate activity

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:84%
because what the
central bank does

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:90%
is affect the interest rate.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The central bank cannot go out
there and buy hamburgers as I

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It can go out there
and buy bonds,

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and with that, it affects
the interest rate.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And for that to matter
for the economy,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.465 align:middle line:84%
not only to
bondholders, it better

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
be the case that that interest
rate matters for the equilibrium

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
level of output.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it does so by
affecting real investment.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's the mechanism through
which monetary policy affects

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:90%
real activity.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Is through the
cost of borrowing.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We simply-- in
reality, consumers

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
are also affected by that, by
the interest rate and so on,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
but let's keep things simple
and have only investment

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
as a function of
the interest rate.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And very importantly,
it's a decreasing function

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
of the interest rate.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:84%
The higher interest
rates, the lower

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
its investment for any
given level of output

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's more costly to
borrow to fund that investment.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us
our curve, which

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.708 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of
output and interest rate

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent with
equilibrium in the goods

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
market-- that is, when output
is equal to aggregate demand.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's the IS So
that point belongs

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.095 align:middle line:84%
to one IS for one
interest rate here.

00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So how do we construct the IS?

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, we start moving
the interest rate.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we start from
this one point in the IS,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:90%
the point I just showed you.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Supposing that now-- we
increase the interest rate,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
we look at the new
equilibrium output.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.238 align:middle line:84%
Well, that also
belongs to this IS.

00:23:30.238 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can keep moving
the interest rate around.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So you move z around only
by moving the interest rate.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't move G, T,
or anything else.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Only by moving the
interest rate, and then

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:90%
you can trace an IS curve.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
If you move other parameters
than the interest rate,

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
then it's a shift
in the IS curve,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
it's not a movement
along the IS curve.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.135 align:middle line:84%
So if, for example, if I
increase G, what happens?

00:23:52.135 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
With this IS curve?

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The IS curve shift to
the right because--

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
now for any given
level of interest rate,

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
output will be higher because
aggregate demand moves up.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a shift to
the right of the IS curve.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
That's an example
of the opposite.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.235 align:middle line:84%
An increase in taxes, well,
it will shift IS to the left.

00:24:17.235 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The LM relationship
is already described.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It is no equilibrium
in financial markets,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
but we said the way
monetary policy is conducted

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
is the Fed sets the
interest rate and the money

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is whatever the market needs
in order for that to be

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
the equilibrium interest rate.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So the model in LM, if you will,
is horizontal just like that.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So now we're set, because
once the Fed decides

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to set this interest
rate, we can

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.825 align:middle line:84%
find not only the equilibrium
combinations of interest rate

00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and output that are consistent
with the equilibrium

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
in the goods market, but
the particular equilibrium

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
level of output that is
consistent with that interest

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
equilibrium output.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So given the LLM, now I looked
at it intersection with my IS,

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and that gives me
equilibrium output

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
for that level of the
interest rate, which

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.165 align:middle line:90%
has been set by the Fed.

00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:15.747 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And then you can use this model.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
powerful little model

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
because now you can do
lots of things with it.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, that's a
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
when you reduce G

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
or when you increase T.
What happens if you reduce

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.445 align:middle line:90%
G and T by the same amount?

00:25:40.445 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm doing.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.457 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you--
that's often done.

00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can increase
government expenditure,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.873 align:middle line:84%
but then you find a
source of revenue,

00:25:52.873 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
or reduce government
expenditure,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
but then you don't need to
generate a fiscal surplus,

00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying, this is a
balanced budget fiscal policy.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's called.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
What if I move G and
T by the same amount?

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Does that curve move?

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.937 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.937 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It does because
the multiplier next to T

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is c0 in the equation--
original equation.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.898 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: c0?

00:26:23.898 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: c1.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Yeah, OK.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So, in which direction
does it move?

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So if I reduce G and reduce
T by the same amount,

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:90%
what happens to IS?

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Moves to the left
or to the right?

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it moves to the left.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Because why is that?

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I can always go back to my basic
goods market equilibrium model.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.115 align:middle line:84%
If I reduce G by 1, that reduces
aggregate demand one by 1.

00:26:52.115 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:90%
One for one.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the
multiplier kicks in.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
If I-- but the initial
change shift down is 1.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
If I reduce taxes, I
increase aggregate demand,

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:90%
but by c1 times 1.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a reduction
in aggregate demand of 1

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and I had an increase in
aggregate demand of c1.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:90%
1 minus c1 is greater than 0.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason you
have, on net, a reduction

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:90%
in aggregate demand.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Hint, this is not a
random thought I had,

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:90%
so do understand it.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.765 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:27:35.765 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Thus, monetary policy.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's an expansionary
monetary policy.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And in equilibrium,
why it's expansionary?

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So cutting interest
rate, because it will

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:90%
increase equilibrium output.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the case in
which the Fed probably

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
is unhappy with this
low level of output,

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's a recession.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So one of the main policy tools
we have to fight a recession

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.065 align:middle line:90%
is to lower the interest rate.

00:28:10.065 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here how
lowering the interest rate

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
will increase
equilibrium output.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.130 align:middle line:90%
How does it happen?

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is it that this happened?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.233 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
equilibrium output rises?

00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.582 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:24.582 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
increasing investment.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:90%
That gives us the first kick.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And once equilibrium
starts rising,

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
then consumption rises and
we get the whole multiplier.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But the initial
impulse is exactly

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:40.540 align:middle line:84%
because this increase
in investment.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And how does it implement that?

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Open market operation.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.017 align:middle line:84%
So what the Fed will do is if it
wants to cut the interest rate,

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
it goes out there, buys
bonds from the public,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and gives them
money in exchange,

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's what happens here.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I talk about
different policy mixes.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:84%
This is what typically when an
economy is deep into recession,

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
both policies that

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
work at the same time
that's very powerful.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the case in which
we have a very-- we cut--

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.640 align:middle line:84%
we have an expansionary
monetary policy that shifts down

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and an expansionary
fiscal policy.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely what we
did during COVID, was massive.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And during the Global
Financial Crisis--

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
so typically big
recessions will lead to--

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
any recession will lead
to something like that.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Obviously if it is
big, you're going

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to have a bigger combination
of this kind of stuff.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Some problems that
monetary policy may face

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes you
hit a zero lower bound.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.727 align:middle line:84%
And then when you hit
a zero lower bound,

00:29:43.727 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:84%
you just can't lower
the interest rate more,

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
you lose monetary policy,
you need to do other stuff,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and typically fiscal policy
then becomes very, very active.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is not just a
theoretical curiosity.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have been
against the zero lower bound

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
for a sustained amount of time
during the last 20 years or so.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.186 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.186 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's another
policy mix as well that--

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:84%
suppose that you need to do
a fiscal adjustment, I said.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So you want to reduce
the deficit, reduce G,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want to have a
recession as a result of that.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
One way you can do that is by--
you have a contraction in G

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:90%
or increase in taxes.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That's contractionary,
but you can offset it

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:84%
with an expansionary
monetary policy.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I think in the quiz somewhere
you have a question--

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.478 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that is specific
to this, but you could

00:30:36.478 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
you're asked to compensate
for something with something

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and something like that.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So some curve move,
and then you're

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:84%
asked to offset that
effect on output.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So you should understand
this kind of things.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The next step was to extend
a little bit our IS-LM model.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And by extension we
said, well, look,

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:90%
at this moment we have only--

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
prices are completely fixed, but
in reality we have inflation.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.868 align:middle line:84%
And so the nominal interest rate
is not really the effective cost

00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:90%
of capital for a company.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.730 align:middle line:84%
A company that wants to
fund the real investment

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
is more concerned with the
real interest rate in Spain,

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
not the nominal interest rate.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So with prices
that are constant,

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
there is no distinction, but
if you have positive inflation,

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.725 align:middle line:84%
then the distinction
makes a difference.

00:31:24.725 --> 00:31:26.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we
want to talk about that.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
is that the same firms

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
are very unlikely to pay the
same that the Treasury pays

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
for borrowing.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It's going to pay--

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
it's a riskier
proposition to invest

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:84%
in bonds issued
by a corporation,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and therefore,
they're going to have

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:90%
to pay a risk premium for that.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the importance
of these two things

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:84%
is that a we ended up
with an IS-LM model that

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
now had something a
little more complicated

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
here because it didn't have
only the nominal interest rate,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:90%
but also had expected inflation.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:84%
If, for any given
nominal interest

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
rate, if we expect
a higher inflation,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that means a lower
real interest rate.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So for any given
nominal interest

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
rate, if expected
inflation goes up,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that's expansionary,
really, for firms.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's cheaper,
in a sense, to borrow.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if x goes
up, the credit spread

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:84%
goes up, that's contractionary
because it's now

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
more expensive for
the firms to borrow

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:84%
for any given real
interest rate.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- this is called
extended IS-LM model simply

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
because it has been
extended to incorporate

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:90%
these additional factors.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have
two more parameters

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:84%
in your model, which
is expected inflation

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and the credit spreads.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you move either
of these, you're

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.480 align:middle line:84%
going to move your
aggregate demand

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:90%
curve in the goods market.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to move for
exactly the same reasons

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that that aggregate demand moved
when you move the interest rate.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It enters symmetrically.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.950 align:middle line:84%
In this model, these guys here
enter completely symmetrically

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:90%
with the interest rate.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So whatever was the
comparative statics

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:84%
you had with respect to
the nominal interest rate

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
before, they applied
to x minus pi.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
say is if you know

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
what is the change
in equilibrium

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:84%
output as a response-- as a
result of an increase in 100

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
basis points on the
nominal interest rate,

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
then you know what is the
response of equilibrium output

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to an increase in credit
spreads of 100 basis points,

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or to a reduction-- or to
a reduction in expected

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:90%
inflation of 100 basis points.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Entirely symmetric.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a channel.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the real-- it's the cost
of capital channel for the firm.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:84%
That's they're all entering
exactly through the same place.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But the Fed doesn't
control this guy,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:84%
it controls only the
nominal interest rate.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:90%
So anyways.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So these are new
parameters here.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.179 align:middle line:90%
So this is an example here.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:84%
That's an example in
which credit spreads

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:90%
or expected inflation went up.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:84%
Where credit spreads went down
or expected inflation went up.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:90%
And that's expansionary.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:84%
That will increase
aggregate demand

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:84%
because for any given
level of output,

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
now there will be
more investment.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Credit spreads are lower or
expected inflation is higher

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:84%
mean the real
interest rate is lower

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:84%
for any given nominal
interest rate.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.976 align:middle line:84%
So if the Fed doesn't
react to that,

00:34:47.976 --> 00:34:49.934 align:middle line:84%
that's going to lead to
an expansion in output.

00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:53.690 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Fed
could react to that.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the Fed is OK with
the level of output we have.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Suppose it's a low output.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed's seeing
credit spreads falling,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.923 align:middle line:90%
so output is expanding.

00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But the Fed says, no, no,
no, the level of output Y0

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:90%
wasn't what I needed.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't want Y1.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
What would the Fed do?

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Increase the interest rate.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to
see in this picture here

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't want this
guy, the total sum to move, then

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:90%
if this guy moves down--

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
or this guy moves up, then
I need to move i exactly

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to offset that, and that's it.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.017 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to calculate.

00:35:33.017 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to solve my
whole model, actually.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.635 align:middle line:84%
You tell me this thing in net
went down by 100 basis points,

00:35:38.635 --> 00:35:40.010 align:middle line:84%
if I don't want
to change output,

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.260 align:middle line:84%
then I need to increase the
interest rate by 100 basis

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
points so I don't change
the cost of borrowing--

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.270 align:middle line:84%
the effective cost of
borrowing for corporations.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is exactly
what is going on right now

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
in the US economy.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Every time Marcus
gets very excited,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
credit spreads are compressed,
the stock market goes up,

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
the Fed comes out and
says, come on, guys.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
inflation problem,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need to keep
hiking interest rates because I

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.678 align:middle line:90%
need to offset your enthusiasm.

00:36:10.678 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't use those words, but
that's exactly what happened.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Chairman Powell
was testifying in Congress

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
yesterday and today,
and that's what he said.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm just giving you a
summary of what he said.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now a problem that the
central bank may face,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:84%
suppose you have the
opposite situation,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is that one in which credit
spreads are going up a lot

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and expected inflation
is declining a lot.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed doesn't
want output to decline

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:84%
because that combination will
lead to a reduction in output.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed wants to
cut interest rate.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.795 align:middle line:90%
What problem may it face?

00:36:46.795 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:90%
The zero lower bound.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It may not be able to bring
interest rates as much as--

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Because suppose that the
interest rate today is 50 basis

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not the case today,
but it was two years ago,

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:84%
50 basis points, or 25 basis
points, and credit spreads

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.285 align:middle line:90%
go up by 200 basis points.

00:37:10.285 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no way
the Fed can offset

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that because it has maximum 25
basis points to lower and credit

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
spreads went up by
100 basis points.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you start seeing
all these more exotic policies--

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:84%
quantitative easing
and other things--

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.030 align:middle line:84%
to offset the negative impact
of the increase in the credit

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:90%
spreads in the economy.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing we did
was to begin our transition

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to wear medium running
shoes, and the whole thing

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:90%
began from the labor market.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to get a
little bit in the quiz of that,

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to be
as important as what I just

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.870 align:middle line:90%
described.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:84%
A little bit you're
going to have.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And the basic-- well,
definitions, you

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.930 align:middle line:84%
should know the
basic definitions.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was the first
important equation.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We had that
wage-setting equation

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that said essentially
that wages are

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.293 align:middle line:90%
increasing in expected prices.

00:38:05.293 --> 00:38:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Obviously the nominal wage the
workers are going to demand

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
is going to be higher if they
expect the price level to be

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:90%
higher in the future.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But importantly, it's decreasing
and unemployment and increasing

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
in this variable that represents
their bargaining power and so

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at what happened
on the price-setting side,

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:90%
meaning what firms do.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we have to start
with the production function.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We had a very simple
production function

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.865 align:middle line:84%
which said if you
want to produce

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
one more unit of the good, you
need to hire one more worker.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
That means that the marginal
cost of production is the wage.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we said
we're going to have

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
a very simple model in
which the firms charge

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:84%
their marginal cost, which is
the wage times the markup 1

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:90%
plus m.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So m is a number like, say, 0.2.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So the wage is 100, the markup
is 20%, they want the price of--

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.940 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
charge a price of $120.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.000 align:middle line:84%
We can rearrange this
in terms of wages,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can say,
well, the firm--

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.370 align:middle line:84%
the maximum real wage that firms
collectively are willing to pay

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
is really 1 over
1 plus the markup.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:90%
That's just from that.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So then we look at a
concept that is important,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:84%
which is the natural
rate of unemployment,

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and we said the natural
rate of unemployment

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:90%
has nothing of natural.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It just means that is the
level of unemployment when

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:84%
the price is equal
to expected price,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.210 align:middle line:84%
or expected price equal
to the price, you pick.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So all that we
did was to replace

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:84%
the wage-setting equation
the expected price

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
for the actual price, and
then we divided both sides.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this real
wage demand by workers,

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:84%
when the price is equal
to expected price,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and we also had a
price-setting equation.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:84%
We can-- and I said when
we replace P e for P,

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
then I get the
right to put an n--

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.653 align:middle line:90%
superscript n there.

00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that's my definition
of the natural rate

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.547 align:middle line:90%
of unemployment.

00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
when I can replace

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in the wage-setting equation the
expected price for the price.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the natural
rate of unemployment,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the equilibrium here
of the price-setting equation.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It has an implied real
wage of 1 over 1 plus m.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.962 align:middle line:84%
And that's the wage-setting
equation, which is obviously

00:40:18.962 --> 00:40:21.420 align:middle line:84%
decreasing unemployment because
the higher is unemployment,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
the lower the wage
demand by the workers.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's one natural
rate of unemployment.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, nothing natural, it's
a function of parameters.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Which parameters?

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a function of
that markup parameter,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:84%
it's a function of this
institutional variable

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:90%
z, for example.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's an equation.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That's an example
in which z goes up.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.365 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that
somehow unions go up

00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
unionization goes up,

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:90%
something of that kind.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Or unemployment benefits
go up, something

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.380 align:middle line:84%
of that kind, which,
in principle, is

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.370 align:middle line:90%
supportive of workers.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this model,
that will immediately

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:84%
lead to an increase
in wage demand--

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.900 align:middle line:84%
at this level of
unemployment, there

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a higher
demand of-- a higher real wage

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.690 align:middle line:84%
demand by the workers because
they have more bargaining power

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
In this particular model, that
cannot happen because the real

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:19.860 align:middle line:84%
wage that firms are willing to
pay is only this, 1, 1 plus m.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
restore equilibrium

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
in the labor market,
what has to happen

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:84%
is unemployment-- natural rate
of unemployment will go up,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and that will restore
equilibrium here

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
because, well, the workers-- the
bargaining power workers gain

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.480 align:middle line:84%
through those benefits
in z they end up

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.990 align:middle line:84%
losing by an increase
in the equilibrium

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:90%
level of unemployment.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason here this
stuff backfire in a sense--

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to the workers
because you end up

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with higher natural
rate of unemployment.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So Europe, for example, has
much higher labor protection

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
than the US.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, they typically have a
much higher unemployment rate

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:90%
than the US.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So that trade-offs,
all these things.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the case of
increasing the markup,

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and increasing the
markup means effectively

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that the firms are going
offering a lower real wage.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this level
of unemployment,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:84%
workers are not going to
take that lower real wage.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So what will have to
happen for workers

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.673 align:middle line:84%
to take that lower real wage
is for unemployment to rise.

00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:22.215 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two canonical
experiments you can have here.

00:42:22.215 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
when markups go up.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And that can go-- they can
go up for the wrong reasons.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be for oil shocks
and stuff like that.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It could be because the market
becomes less competitive

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
or it will be used to
[INAUDIBLE] and so on.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But the final outcome here is
that we end up with a higher

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:84%
natural rate of
unemployment, which, again,

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
highlights the idea that this
is not a God-given unemployment

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.600 align:middle line:90%
rate, so it's not--

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not good in
any sense, it's just

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.401 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is the equilibrium.

00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So you should understand well
what these two type of shocks

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:84%
do to the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's--

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.630 align:middle line:84%
because lecture 9 is
not for this quiz.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want to say.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.050 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.595 align:middle line:90%
So-- oh, yeah.

00:43:16.595 --> 00:43:19.310 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.918 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.918 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:26.955 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:43:26.955 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.478 align:middle line:84%
I think-- is that the
same x as next to the--

00:43:30.478 --> 00:43:31.520 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.603 align:middle line:90%
This is the credit spread.

00:43:32.603 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:84%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: You
want me to explain this--

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I just want to
make sure it's credit spread.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.567 align:middle line:84%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Yeah,
this is the credit spread.

00:43:40.567 --> 00:43:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I said-- that's the way
you calculate this credit

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:43.840 align:middle line:90%
spread here.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.548 align:middle line:84%
It's-- remember, there
are two reasons why--

00:43:46.548 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.480 align:middle line:90%
you really want to know?

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:90%
In any event, let me say.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are two reasons why the
credit spreads really happened.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.540 align:middle line:84%
One is the actual
probability of default

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of a bond, which the Treasury
has a very low probability

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to default. Corporations,
depending on the ratings,

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.470 align:middle line:90%
they may have a high or low.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, which
is very significant,

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is how risk-averse
investors are.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And that risk aversion changes
a lot over the business cycle.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:84%
We capture everything through
just that x spread, which

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we capture through this
probability of default.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But you can think of that
probability of default

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.023 align:middle line:84%
as being the perceived
probability of default.

00:44:30.023 --> 00:44:32.440 align:middle line:84%
When you're very scared, you
perceive that terrible things

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's a subjective
probability of default.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So when that probability of
default is different from 0,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:84%
then you start getting
a positive spread.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How impactful
is the actual default?

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I know there were some recent
defaults in at least the

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.800 align:middle line:90%
European real estate markets.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.900 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.733 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Like how--

00:44:52.733 --> 00:44:56.295 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is there a difference
between a fear of a default

00:44:56.295 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and like an actual default,
like the implications--

00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.378 align:middle line:90%
RICHARDO CABALLERO: Oh.

00:44:59.378 --> 00:45:01.270 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
perceived risk.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So because this
determines the borrowing

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that firms can do-- the
cost for firms of borrowing.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.680 align:middle line:84%
If you already defaulted, you
cannot borrow, so that's over.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:90%
That has other consequences.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It may have impact on the
balance sheets of the banks,

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.162 align:middle line:84%
it's destruction of wealth,
it may lead to other problems.

00:45:18.162 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we're
highlighting here in this model

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is the cost of
borrowing, and that

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:28.650 align:middle line:84%
is something that happens
only before you default.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actual defaults,
especially typically

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.140 align:middle line:84%
in developers and
stuff like that,

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:84%
can-- and that's what happened
in the Great Recession,

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.510 align:middle line:84%
it can have
consequences, especially

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:84%
for the banks that typically
lend to these developers

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But I may do something
about financial crisis,

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.280 align:middle line:84%
but much later in the
course at the end.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, good luck.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:84%
If you understood what I said
today, you're in good shape.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:90%
