00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
OK, so today we're

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:84%
going to start talking
about the long run.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
the business cycles,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.095 align:middle line:84%
and today we're going to
start talking about things

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:90%
that happen over decades.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But before I do that, before
we finish with the short run,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
medium run, I don't want
to give you the impression

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
that once you
understand the IS-LM-PC

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
you can start managing
monetary policy immediately.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of noise
of all sorts of complexity

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in the real world,
of course, that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
can make policies very
hard to manage in practice.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Macroeconomic policies.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And one fundamental
principle, I would say,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
is that policymakers
understand that speed can kill,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's very obvious
during financial crisis.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
There we all understand that
the response needs to be large.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a response
with overwhelming force.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, because
things are happening

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
so fast that very few
corporations, even

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
healthy corporations
that can adjust quickly

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
enough to the pace at
which things are changing,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:84%
prices become non-informative,
fire sales take place,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and obviously it's
very difficult

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to make economic
decisions in that context.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.425 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason they
are-- the speed on the policy

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
direction goes very
clearly in one direction.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Do it quickly and very large.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other
hand, when you're

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
going through a period in
which you're hiking interest

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
rates, for example, like
we're going through now,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the tendency is
towards gradualism,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to do it very slowly, because
something can break along

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:90%
the path.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's often the case that for
sufficiently large adjustments,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:90%
something breaks.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And so here you have an example
of major episode of hiking

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
in the US and things
that have happened

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:90%
among those major episodes.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
This one actually, I have a
personal attachment to that one,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
because I was studying
in Chile around then.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
going wonderfully.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Massive capital
flows through Chile.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Emerging markets
were very popular.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
We all felt very
wealthy, rich, and so on.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And right after I
finished college,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I was not planning
to come to the US.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Things were going
very well in Chile.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But the US decided to
hike interest rates

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:90%
very aggressively.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, capital flows
to emerging markets disappeared.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We went into an enormous
financial crisis.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I lost-- I had no
opportunity cost,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and I had to come
to study to the US.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I know that aggressive
hikes can matter,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:90%
can make differences to people.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And there is a decade that
followed that episode that

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is called the lost decade of
Latin America, essentially.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:90%
So things did break.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
reasons they did

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.745 align:middle line:84%
break is because at the
time, most of the capital

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
flows-- that's not
what happens today--

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
were really being
managed by global banks.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And banks can get
very distressed

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
when interest rates
rise very quickly.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that was essentially
a problem with the US

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
banks, the major global banks,
but the US banks in particular

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that triggered an
emerging market crisis.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.892 align:middle line:84%
This one also had huge
consequences, actually.

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because this episode

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
is similar to what
is going on right now

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:90%
or what may happen soon.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So this episode of
hikes that ended what

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is called the savings
and loan crisis.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
And those, the best
parallel to today,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
are the small regional
banks, if you will.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't able to
withstand this sharp rise

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in interest rate, which is very
much what is going on right now

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
This one actually ended up with
also another problem, which

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:90%
is the bubble burst in Japan.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Episode of hiking in the US.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And there we had a
major crisis in Japan.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The price of real
estate collapsed,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and essentially they,
since then, they

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
have never been able
to grow as they used to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:90%
before that episode.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
That's called sometimes
the tequila crisis.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a Mexican bond crisis,
and it was, again, the result

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
of a hiking episode in the US.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Conditions tightened
to emerging markets.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Their bond market
essentially exploded.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a global financial
crisis, the Great Recession.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
It was again preceded by episode
of aggressive hikes, which

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
eventually let to turn around
as house prices were rising

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
steadily throughout the episode
and a lot of financial assets

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
were created around that housing
wealth that was being created.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
That hike in interest rate
eventually put a stop, an end

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
to that appreciation
of house prices.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they turned
around, and it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
led to a very significant
financial crisis.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we're at right now.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we are already seeing
some tremors and so on.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So the point is when
sometimes people say, well,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
why isn't the fed
more aggressive

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
if we have high inflation
and go very quickly at it?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because
things can go wrong.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it typically happens
that things do go wrong.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't know exactly
what will blow up,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
but something may blow up.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And typically it's associated
to some financial market that

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.995 align:middle line:84%
is very hot, and the
market and the banks

00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
are always involved in
that because the banks

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:90%
are very lever.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
They have little capital
relative to the assets

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
they have, and that
means a small variation

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in the price of assets can
lead to very large changes

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:90%
in the value of their capital.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Anyways.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
So just a warning.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you get a job at the
fed, please be careful.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let me switch gears.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about something

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
a little different from what we
have been discussing up to now.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is growth projections
for different regions

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.815 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
is published by the IMF.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It's called the World
Economic Outlook.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I think I mentioned it before.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And here you have
some forecasts.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is actually
what happened.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So growth in the global
economy was about 3.4% 2022.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Advanced economies grew at 2.7%,
emerging markets and developing

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:90%
economies at 3.9%.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And then you see forecasts.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And the further out
you go is less related

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:90%
to the current cycle.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more related to
what is structural.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
The structural growth of the
different parts of the world.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And you see that for
2024, the global economy

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is projected, expected
to grow at around 3.1%.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:84%
These forecasts were made
before financial mess that

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
were going on right now, so
probably the next World Economic

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Outlook will have, at least for
2023, will downgrade the growth.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Probably not for 2024,
but yes, for 2023

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, advanced
economies expected

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to grow at 1.4%,
emerging markets at 4.2%.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So these forecasts are
based on a combination

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:84%
of cyclical factors,
fluctuations

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
of the short run, medium
run, the kind of things we

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:90%
have been discussing up to now.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Some economists will have
to go through recessions.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Some economists are
going through booms.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
That probably dominates
the forecast on 2023.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But as I said before,
the further out you go,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
the less relevant is the
current business cycle

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and the more relevant
is the structural trend

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of the different
regions of the world.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So I would conjecture that
in this, when they formulated

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
this forecast, this is very much
based on more longer-run growth

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
model, the kind of models
we are going to discuss now.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
While this is probably totally
dominated by the kind of things

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.099 align:middle line:90%
we discuss up to now.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
There are several things
that are interesting here,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:84%
aside from the fluctuations
in year to year.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
One thing you can
see, for example,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is that regardless
of year, on average,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
emerging markets
tend to grow faster

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
than developed economies,
advanced economies.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we want to understand

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:90%
is why is that the case.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's very clear here.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The first model we're
going to look at,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
which probably will
happen on Wednesday,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
will try to explain
essentially that-- why

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is it that these guys tend to
grow faster than the advanced

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:90%
economies?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.242 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:90%
So growth is important.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Understanding economic growth is
hugely important for the world,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the
health of an economy.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Here you see-- this
comes from the textbook--

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
the US GDP in 2012 dollars
from 1890 to 2017, I think

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:90%
is this one, the end year.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
to notice here

00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is how large is the change
in GDP in during this period.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
GDP here, measured in the
same prices, so 2012 prices,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:90%
is 50 times that in 1890.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a big thing.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about business
cycle fluctuations,

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about, in
an economy like the US,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:90%
2%, 2.5%, 3% up and down.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:90%
This is 50 times.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So over longer periods
of time, you can almost

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
ignore the business
cycle, and it's

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:90%
all about that long-run trend.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Here, what is this episode?

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.983 align:middle line:84%
So here, if you look
at this picture,

00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
especially the
further out you are

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
on the room, what dominates
here is clearly the trend.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
The only action you see,
really significant action

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
different from the
trend, is around here.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the Great Depression.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So even the Great Depression
doesn't look that big relative

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%
to what the trend can do.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So of course, it's
very difficult

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to affect the
trend of a country,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
but the trend makes a huge
difference for the welfare,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
for the economic
well-being of a country.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of that is because
also the US population

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
grew up and grew a lot
during this episode.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So often when you look
at long-run trends,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
rather than looking
at the level of GDP,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
you tend to look at the level
of GDP per person, per capita,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And that picture is exactly the
same picture as the previous one

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.975 align:middle line:84%
but divided by population
at each point in time.

00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important--
over long periods--

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
at the business
cycle frequency, you

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.248 align:middle line:84%
can almost ignore changes
in population-- no, changes

00:11:50.248 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in population you can
not ignore completely

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:90%
unless you are in a war.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You worry about other things--
labor force participation

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
But population is irrelevant
to the business cycle.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Growth is relevant to the
business cycle frequency,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
but not over long
periods of time.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
In this period here,
population in the US

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
increased from 63
million to 320 million.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's a lot more
workers in principle

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
that you have for that economy.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that trend is
explained by population growth,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and that's one of the reasons--

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the strength
in this picture

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
here is explained by
population growth.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons
we're in a tricky time

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
in the global
economy, because there

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:84%
are many important regions
of the world where population

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
is no longer growing.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So we got used to a period in
which population growth was very

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
steady and high, and now,
many parts of the world,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
important parts of the world,
have negative population

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:90%
growth--

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Japan, Korea, China, most
of continental Europe,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
even places in Latin
America, and so on.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is a big
change for the world.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, during
that period there

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of population growth.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And the US in
particular, again, as I

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
said before, from
63 to 320 million.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want
to measure welfare

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of the economy, the well-being
of individuals in the US,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
the previous picture
is misleading

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because you have to-- yeah, the
final pie is 50 times larger

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
than the first, than
the beginning pie,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
but you have 320 million
people to split it

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
among as opposed to 63 million.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
So this picture captures that.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
A statistic that
is often described

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about long-run
growth is GDP per person.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And you still see
that what dominates

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:84%
this picture is a trend, but
the difference between this GDP

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:84%
per person in the US at
the end of the sample

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
versus the beginning of
the sample, it's 10 to 1,

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
not 50 to 1, so it makes
a difference, population.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:90%
It's still big.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It's still what dominates
this picture is that.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course the Great
Recession looks bigger

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
now because you're comparing
it with a number that

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
grows by a factor of 10,
not by a factor of 50,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:90%
so it looks bigger naturally.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The same 30% decline in
output is a lot bigger

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
when you're comparing
it with a factor of 10

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
than when you compare
it with a factor of 50.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:90%
But still, it looks bigger.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But the picture is
dominated by the trend.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So all this to say that what
we're going to study now

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not what dominates
the day to day news

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
because it happens
slowly and over time,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:90%
but it is very important.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So how do we measure
these things?

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
within a country,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
you do reasonably well, not
perfect, but reasonably well,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps not over
periods as long as the one

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I showed you, by looking
at GDP per capita.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You measure it real GDP per
capita, that's about fine.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you compare across
different regions of the world

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and so on, those comparisons
is very misleading.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:90%
So to say that the US has--

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.978 align:middle line:84%
What is the US GDP per
capita today in the US?

00:15:21.978 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Somebody should check it.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's about maybe
$70,000, something like that.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you see another
country that has, say, Italy,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%
$50,000 per capita.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
That comparison is
not that meaningful.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It's indicative of
something, but it's not

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:90%
completely meaningful.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you an example which

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:90%
is much more extreme than that.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it's
not very meaningful

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
is essentially because the
prices are not the same

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
across different
parts of the world.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have a method
to do that, to be

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
able to compare
across countries.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, even for a given
country over long periods

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
of time, we make a
correction to the GDP numbers

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
we have and we correct
them by what is called PPP,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Purchasing Power Parity.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'll explain what that is.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you see
comparisons of GDP per capita

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
across countries, when somebody
is doing a growth analysis,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.720 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be PPP adjusted.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.475 align:middle line:84%
Now let me explain
the logic of PPP.

00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:36.616 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, I said, within
the same country or periods,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
perhaps not 300 years, but
over periods of 40 years,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:84%
it's reasonable to
use just real GDP.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you start comparing
Botswana versus the US,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
it gets a lot
trickier because there

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of goods that are a
lot cheaper in poorer countries,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
in particular food.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.301 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be careful
with those comparisons.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
you this example, which

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is somewhat hypothetical, but
the numbers are not crazy.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have two
economies, the US and Russia--

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:90%
well, anyways.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And suppose that
in both economies,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
households and firms
consume cars and food.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And suppose that the average
consumer in the US buys one car

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
a year for $10,000 and a bundle
of food for $10,000 as well,

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
so the total expenditure in
consumption for this household

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
on average is about
$20,000 a year.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what a US
household consumes.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
These numbers are
fantasy numbers,

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
but the big picture
is not that fantasy.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Russia, the average consumer
buys 0.07 cars a year for 40,000

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
rubles and the same bundle
of food that in the US.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Same, assume that.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Same bundle of food
good for 80,000 rubles.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So the total expenditure of this
average household in Russia is

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
120,000 rubles.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the exchange
rate is 60 rubles per dollar.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
This thing has moved
a lot in recent times,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
but suppose that's the
number of rubles per dollar.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So you divide $120,000, and
you want to convert them

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
into dollars, you divide the
120,000 rubles by 60,000 rubles

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
per dollar, and then you get
how much a Russian household

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on average spends on
consumption in a year,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's $2,000 a year.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So here you have 120,000
divided by 60. it's 2,000.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the number of dollars
that an average household

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:90%
in Russia consumes.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, you have
a US household spends $20,000

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
a year, a Russian household
spends $2,000 a year.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is then, is Russia

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:90%
10 times poorer than the US?

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
If you were to compare real
GDP, that would be answer.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look at, again,
in this example,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
real GDP numbers

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:84%
on the same year converted
all into dollars,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:90%
that answer is correct.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
represent-- the point

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
is that it doesn't
represent really

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the well-being of the
average household in Russia

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:90%
for this reason, at least.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.915 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But you ultimately matter is how
much real goods the household

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
consumes.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what really matters.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a country where
the price of everything is zero,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
your consumption expenditure
consumption will be zero.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
you are as unhappy as somebody

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.597 align:middle line:90%
that consumes zero.

00:20:14.597 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:90%
You're consuming whatever it is.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It happens that the prices
tend to be very low.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially
the story here.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, it
tends to be the case

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that in poorer countries, a
lot of things are cheaper.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:84%
There is certain
very high-tech things

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.265 align:middle line:84%
that are not even consumed
in poorer countries,

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
so you have to adjust
for that as well.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the regular things,
the bulk of the purchases

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
tend to be a lot cheaper
in poorer countries.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
is behind the reason why

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.742 align:middle line:84%
in this example,
the answer is no.

00:20:46.742 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not true that
the Russians are

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
10 times-- the Russian
household in this example

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:90%
is 10 times poorer than the US.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's check it.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's our example.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, not so fast.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's use-- so assume that
the goods are the same,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
so the cars that the Russians
buy is the same as the cars

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:90%
that the US households buy.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
That was truer a few
months ago than now,

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
but assume that's the case.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
Russians change their cars

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%
less frequently.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
In this example,
the US household

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is changing the car once a year,
while the Russians are changing

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the car no less than once every
10 years, one every 15 years

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume also that
the bundle of food

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
in both places.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So since the car is the same and
the bundle of food is the same,

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I can use US prices to
measure ration consumption.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's comparable to what
US consumption is because I'm

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to convert the goods
they're consuming into something

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that's comparable to
what the US consumes.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Since the goods
themselves are the same,

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
if I value them at the same
price, either of the two prices,

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.752 align:middle line:84%
but at the same
prices, then I'm going

00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make the
comparison that I really want.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what PPP
adjustment means.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So look at our
particular example.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, the Russian household
would be consuming 0.07 cars

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
times $10,000, which
is the price of a car,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 unit of a bundle of food.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And the US price is
$10,000 for that.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So the total consumption of
the household, PPP adjusted,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the Russian
household is $10,700.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not 1/10.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It's 53% of US consumption.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So true, Russian household
is poorer than an average US

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.995 align:middle line:84%
household, but it's
not 10 times poorer.

00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It's 53% as rich as
the US household.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And so this is big.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And all the numbers I'm
going to show you next,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
especially when we compare
across countries that

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
are very different in terms of
level of development and so on,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
have these kind of
corrections built in.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
If you need the data
for these kind of things

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason,
you find them

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in what is called
the Penn Tables.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The Penn Tables is
essentially collects

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
all the national
accounts of all places

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:90%
and makes these corrections.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they don't
update them very frequently.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you look in,
[? Fred, ?] for example, which

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is using one of
the P sets, there

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:84%
will be numbers for
a few countries that

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:90%
have this PPP adjustment.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's going to
remain in the background now,

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted to tell
you how you construct numbers

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
when you want to talk about
long-run and comparison

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:90%
across countries.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:90%
First set of numbers here.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
These are obviously all, today,
at least, developed economies.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Look at the growth
between 1950, 2017.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the war created a
big mess there, but before that,

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:90%
so let's start from 1950.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And what you see here is France,
on average during this period,

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:90%
France grew--

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.972 align:middle line:84%
2013 I think is the last--
yes, it's the last year.

00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
recently updated,

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but at least when the
book was published,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that was the last year
they had Penn Tables for.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:41.162 align:middle line:84%
But France grew, on average,
2.6% per year on average.

00:24:41.162 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
They also had a business
cycle and so on,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:90%
but on average, 2.6% per year.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.983 align:middle line:84%
Japan during this
period grew by 4.1%.

00:24:47.983 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:90%
UK, 2.1%.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:90%
The US, 2%.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So the developed world
essentially grew around 2.7%

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:90%
on average during this period.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Look at the effect that this has
on the level of GDP per person.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And all these PPP are adjusted.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
For the case of
France, 5.6 times.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So they started with $7,000,
and they were close to $40,000

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
in 2017, so the
ratio is raised 5.6.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Look at the US.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The US is 2%, and
that ratio is--

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
it's still richer than
France per person in 2017,

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
but the ratio of that to
that is smaller than that.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So over a long period
of time, that's

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
what the trend in
the picture capture.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
A small difference in
the rate of growth,

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
if they are sustained for
a long period of time,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
can make quite a
bit of difference

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:90%
for the change in GDP.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the first--
what is the pattern--

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:90%
let's find the pattern here.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a very clear pattern
in that picture, in that table.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you spot it?

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't actually realized it
when I was looking at my notes

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and then realized that it's
very clear in this table.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
I added this line,

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I updated the
slide this morning.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you see a pattern?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The higher growth
rate have a higher multiple.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Yeah,
Yes, but that's math.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's a true statement,
but that's just math.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
There's an economic
thing that I want to--

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
so you're right, but I want--

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I should have clarified.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.695 align:middle line:84%
There's an economic
pattern there.

00:26:55.695 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Let me simplify.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Just look at these two columns,
because a higher number here

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:90%
simply--

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.832 align:middle line:84%
A higher number here
simply means that you

00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:90%
have a higher rate of growth.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:90%
That's your math facts.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So ignore this column.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
What I suggest is that you
just look at these two columns.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you see a pattern?

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Just look at these two columns.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
This one, in a sense, just
repeats information that is here

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:90%
for the reason you described.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.828 align:middle line:84%
But just look at
these two columns.

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Is there a pattern there?

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Richer countries
tend to grow slower.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The richest country
here is the US.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Had the lowest rate
of growth on average.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The poorest was
Japan there, and they

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
had the highest rate of growth.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.932 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:57.932 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
important correlation.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.467 align:middle line:84%
And again, the first model we're
going to see of economic growth

00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to explain
that correlation.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Why is it that we see that?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.523 align:middle line:90%
Those were for five economies.

00:28:09.523 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:90%
You could say it's an axiom.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:90%
But look at this.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:84%
This is rich countries
in general since 1950s.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.772 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
here in this axis,

00:28:17.772 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you have the annual
rate of growth,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the average rate of
growth, and here,

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:90%
the GDP per person in 1950.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning
of the sample, 1950,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:84%
these countries have this
level of GDP per capita.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then here is
the rate of growth

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:90%
on average from 1950 to 1987.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear
there that there's

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:90%
a downward sloping pattern, no?

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's the same fact now
for many more countries,

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
this it's a downward-sloping
relationship.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
The richest countries
tend to grow much slower

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.293 align:middle line:84%
than the countries
that were poorer

00:28:52.293 --> 00:28:53.585 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the sample.

00:28:53.585 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:84%
There are some interesting
outliers, like Mexico,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and it's interesting in itself.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say a lot
about why that's the case,

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
but let me for now stick to the
pattern, the dominant pattern,

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.587 align:middle line:84%
which is a downward-sloping
relationship.

00:29:18.587 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:90%
That's another way of seeing it.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is for just a
bigger variety of countries.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I have Botswana, China,
Thailand, and so on.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see here, GDP at
the beginning of the 1950

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and GDP by 2018.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern here,
which is essentially

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
a repetition of the pattern
that I showed you before,

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:43.115 align:middle line:84%
is that there is much more
compression here than here.

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.850 align:middle line:84%
How can you have more
compassion here than here?

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, because there is
some sort of convergence.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:90%
There is a sense of convergence.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's that those that
were poorer tend

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to grow a little faster
than those that were richer,

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and therefore they tend
to converge to each other.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the point
I'm highlighting here.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this pressure, 1950,
much less dispersion in 2018.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
That means that on average,
the poorer countries

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
are growing faster than
the richer countries.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, all this
is per capita, PPP

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:90%
adjusted, and all that.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
This picture, again,
sort of makes the point,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
but now it takes
many more countries.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:90%
The point of this picture--

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:90%
it's in the book--

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:90%
is to highlight that--

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
it's a little
messy, the picture,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:84%
but to highlight that if you
look in different regions,

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.240 align:middle line:84%
OECD is the major
economies, tend to--

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:90%
the pattern I showed you holds.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
If you only isolate
only the blue squares,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
you tend to see that
negative relationship.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:10.980 align:middle line:84%
If you look at within Asia,
it's a little bit noisier,

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.212 align:middle line:84%
but you also tend to see
a negative relationship.

00:31:16.212 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Africa, that
relationship is lost completely.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the world as a whole,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
the picture is not as neat
as the one I showed you

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because there are certain
pockets of the world that

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
are not behaving according
to the kind of models

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to discuss in
the next few lectures.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they're not behaving,

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.460 align:middle line:84%
is entirely-- it's
almost outside economics.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It's political conflicts,
wars, and things

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of that nature which
continuously disrupt

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.110 align:middle line:84%
the economic forces that
I'm going to highlight

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:90%
in the next few lectures.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's a different issue.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
All the models
I'll show you next

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:84%
are about the blue and the green
squares and triangles there.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.175 align:middle line:90%
Not about the red ones.

00:32:12.175 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So I show you what
happens across countries

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
over a certain period of time,
which is long but not that long.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Here you see what happens
in longer history.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There are two patterns that
I like to highlight here,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is that first, for a
while you didn't see much,

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.940 align:middle line:84%
but you tend to see
a big acceleration,

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world especially,
around the 1950s or so.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So clearly the Western
world was growing faster

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the world.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:90%
The Western hemisphere.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a more [INAUDIBLE]
type and grouping.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And you see that there's
a very fast acceleration

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.530 align:middle line:90%
in growth in this episode here.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Western Europe was
also flattish and then

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
picked up very strongly there.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And you see the different
regions of the world.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see the
sub-Saharan Africa region

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that sort of hasn't
really picked up.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Much longer history.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way it looks
for the world as a whole.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Exponential pictures
tend to look like that,

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
but this is more dramatic
than exponential.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, what
happened here is going

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to be very different
from the kind of models

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll describe next.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:84%
This period here
is mostly dominated

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:84%
by what's called the Malthusian
era, which is essentially

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:84%
people live, population
grew, and so on,

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
depending on how good was the
harvest that year and so on.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.429 align:middle line:84%
So you had this model in which
this population grew faster.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.335 align:middle line:84%
There was a main
driver of growth.

00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, but, you know,
there wasn't enough food

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:84%
to sustain a higher
population, and then you stay.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
So there was a fight
between food and people

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and not much space for-- most
people were in agriculture,

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't
much to build on.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays there are
pockets in the world,

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and we had the severe
situations during COVID,

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
but food is not really
a constraint for growth

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:90%
for the world as a whole.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words, had you
taken this course in year 1,000

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
or in the Renaissance, nobody
would have talked about growth.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that happened, really.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a very modern
thing to think

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.090 align:middle line:84%
about these pictures with
these long trends and so on.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.055 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
You would have talked about
a lot more interesting things

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
than this, but not about
growth, that's for sure.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And growth, the last point I
think I want to make about this

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.243 align:middle line:90%
is it makes a big difference.

00:35:16.243 --> 00:35:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you can read that.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I have here
is GDP per capita

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:84%
in 1950 versus GDP
per capita in 2016.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
isochrons here.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.040 align:middle line:90%
As you move up--

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:84%
so this line here is what
happens to countries.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a 45-degree line, so if
you are on the 45-degree line,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:84%
means that you haven't grown
at all during this period.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
No, because that means that
your GDP per capita in 1950

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is the same as your
GDP per capita in 2016.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.920 align:middle line:84%
That means on average,
you didn't grow.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But as I keep moving
these lines up,

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.415 align:middle line:84%
it means you grew faster
and faster and faster.

00:35:58.415 --> 00:36:01.995 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you move
along this line here,

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that means you have
negative growth on average

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:90%
during that period.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So each of these lines
represents multiples.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, this top line
here is 30 times richer.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
These are guys that
grew very fast.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I cannot read either, but I sort
of know who is in each place.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:90%
This is an example here.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:90%
This is Taiwan.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:84%
This is Taiwan, and
this is Singapore.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:90%
They have a name.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:90%
How do we call those countries?

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:90%
No, well-- the Asian Tigers.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They grew very strong for a
long time since the '60s or so.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
But there you see.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:90%
You can compare.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:84%
If you could see, you
would see that Taiwan

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Democratic Republic of
Congo had the same GDP in 1950.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Now the Democratic
Republic of Congo

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
has less GDP than
it had in 1950.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It had $1,700 here
and $800 today,

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
while Taiwan has 30 times
what it used to have.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And so today, Taiwan is one
of the richest economies

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.310 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's close to
$50,000 per capita,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.353 align:middle line:84%
while the Republic
of Congo has $700--

00:37:38.353 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:90%
$800 per capita.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So growth makes
a big difference.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are not
that many years.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:90%
This is just 70 years.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can assure you
that these people, they

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:84%
have other concerns, but
their standard of living

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is a lot higher
than these people.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
they were the same.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
The big difference is
some countries grew

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and some countries got stuck.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Where is Argentina here?

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere here, probably.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.578 align:middle line:90%
It's Argentina.

00:38:15.578 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a better chance here.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So growth does
make a difference.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And it has made a huge--
the world we see today

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and the countries we
think as rich or poor

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
were not the same countries
that you thought in those terms

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
in 1950.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Asia is one of the most
prominent differences.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They have massive growth through
the '60s starting with Japan,

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:90%
but then the rest.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, were
the famous Tigers--

00:38:53.050 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore, and Korea.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:90%
South Korea.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's start building some
models of what we have just

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.990 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when we
look at the short run,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:84%
we really didn't care about
the supply side of the economy.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it was
all about demand.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
demand, look what

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
consumers, investment firms,
and governments do with demand.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:90%
That determines output.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.440 align:middle line:90%
And how output happens?

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, it happens.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really care
too much about it.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Then when we talked
about the medium term,

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
we say, OK, no, no, we have
to care because to produce,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you need workers,
and workers are not

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
going to work for
any wage, and so

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
we have to begin to talk about
the supply side of the economy.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:90%
But we made it very simple.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:84%
We just looked at the problem
of wage bargaining and price

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:90%
setting.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But the production function
itself wasn't that interesting.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It was output equal to labor.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I told you it's
very unrealistic,

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
but it was convenient for
that part of the course

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because capital
doesn't grow that fast.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So typical production function
will have both capital

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and labor, but at the
business cycle frequency,

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:84%
investment, the change
in capital can be large,

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:84%
but the stock of capital doesn't
move that much and so you

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:84%
can ignore it for business
cycle type fluctuations.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
look at the long run,

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
capital plays a huge role,
capital accumulation.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be explicit
about the role of capital

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:90%
in the production function.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:31.012 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to forget
about aggregate demand.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to say,
look, we're going

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to focus about aggregate
supply, and demand will

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:90%
do whatever it needs to do.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So we get what the
supply side says.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So output now will be
an increasing function

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:90%
of both capital and labor.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.420 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Now this function will
have a bunch of properties,

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%
many of which are--

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:84%
no, at a broad level, they
are empirically validated,

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:84%
but they are also very
convenient from the modern point

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.380 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The first and most
important property

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.055 align:middle line:90%
is constant returns to scale.

00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
a lot of properties,

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:90%
so please get that concept.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Constant returns to
scale means simply

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that if you scale the
factors of production,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.300 align:middle line:90%
you also scale the output.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:28.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So say if x is 1.1,
that means if you

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
increase capital and labor by
10%, you get 10% more output.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's constant
returns to scale.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
If I scale all the
factors of production

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:84%
by the same amount,
the same proportion,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:84%
then output grows by
the same proportion.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.545 align:middle line:90%
It's scalable.

00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:52.545 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means,
constant returns to scale.

00:41:52.545 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Very important property
what comes next--

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.975 align:middle line:90%
decreasing returns to capital.

00:42:00.975 --> 00:42:03.930 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That is, as you increase capital
for a fixed amount of labor--

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.410 align:middle line:84%
so constant returns
to scale is a property

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.183 align:middle line:90%
of a scaling everything up.

00:42:14.183 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The property I'm
describing here is what

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:90%
happens if we increase only k.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.645 align:middle line:84%
What happens to output if we
increase only k but fixing n?

00:42:21.645 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:90%
In other words.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.008 align:middle line:84%
set this to one, and it
start moving this up.

00:42:30.008 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to get x here.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
something different from x.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.060 align:middle line:84%
What this tells you
is that, yes, you're

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:84%
going to get more output, but
less and less the more capital

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.050 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So this says, for
example, suppose

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that you start with 100 workers
and 100 units of capital,

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and it happens that this
produces 100 units of goods.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
If you add now 10
units of capital,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
say you're going to get
seven units of output.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Not 10, seven, because
you didn't increase labor.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Had I increased
labor also by 10,

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I would have gotten
10 of output,

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.920 align:middle line:84%
but I've been increasing
only capital by 10,

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:84%
then I'm keeping output
fixed-- then labor fixed,

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:84%
then output will
increase by less than 10.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But what this decreasing
returns to capital says

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is that now if
you increase again

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.680 align:middle line:84%
from 110 to 120
units of capital,

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.530 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get less than
seven units of output more.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get five.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.532 align:middle line:84%
And if you increase
again from 120 to 130,

00:43:33.532 --> 00:43:34.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get less than five.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:36.460 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get three.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And so on and so forth.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:84%
That's decreasing
returns to scale--

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.560 align:middle line:90%
decreasing returns to capital.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that economically

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.640 align:middle line:84%
is that more and more
capital is working

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
with a fixed number of
workers, so labor becomes

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
very scarce for capital.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reason.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.977 align:middle line:90%
So you have very little of--

00:43:57.977 --> 00:44:00.310 align:middle line:84%
these are factors of production
which are complementary.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:84%
They need each other,
labor and capital.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You fix one, and it starts
increasing only one,

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:84%
then it's harder and harder for
each extra new unit of this one

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:84%
to work with fewer and fewer of
the other factor of production.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So the same principle
applies to labor.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
If you fix capital and
you only increase labor,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.172 align:middle line:84%
then initially you're going
to get a big jump in output,

00:44:21.172 --> 00:44:23.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be smaller and
smaller and smaller the more you

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.130 align:middle line:90%
keep adding labor.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So one x that we're
going to use throughout

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:90%
is we want to make x--

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:84%
one of our favorite
x will be 1 over n.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:48.640 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm trying to do.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
When we set x equal
to 1 over n, so

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that x equal to 1 over n, what
I get here is output per person.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what I get.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:90%
y over n.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So if I set x equal
to 1 over n, I

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.050 align:middle line:84%
can use some constant
returns to scale.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I know that this is equal to
y over n, k over n, n over n,

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
so that is one, so
this guy doesn't move.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have now that
output per person

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is increasing in
capital per worker.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Worker and population, this
part of the course are the same.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Forget unemployment.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Any population is employment.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Labor force is everything.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not a place to
worry about unemployment.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:42.720 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember that all
the plots I showed you,

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the different figures,
were about this variable--

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:84%
how it change over time,
how it was different

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.390 align:middle line:84%
across different countries,
how it grew at a different rate

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.820 align:middle line:90%
in different countries.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But from this very
simple model, you

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:84%
see that in order to explain
the change in this growth in y

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
over n and why one country
grows more than the other,

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.360 align:middle line:84%
you have with the simple
model only two options.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So if I tell you country A grew
more over this period than--

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:25.620 align:middle line:84%
grew more per person
than this other country

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.760 align:middle line:84%
over this period of time, there
are only two options here.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
in that country,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:84%
there was more capital
accumulation per worker,

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:90%
so k over n went up.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.260 align:middle line:84%
If k over n goes up more in
one country than the other one,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:84%
y over n will go up more in that
country than in the other one.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And the other option is that
this function itself shifted up.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So for any given
amount of k over n, now

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:90%
you can produce more y over n.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
technological progress.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the second thing.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So is the difference in
growth of output per person

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is due to an
increase in k over n,

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:middle line:84%
well, we call that a capital
accumulation mechanism.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.380 align:middle line:84%
If it is because the
function f shifts up,

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:90%
that's technological progress.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to
do is in the next lecture,

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
this channel, the capital

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:90%
accumulation channel.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the lecture
after the spring break,

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
shifts in the function f.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So in figures-- so
fixing the technology,

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
function f is fixed

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and you just move k over n,
this is the picture you have.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a production.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm plotting this function
here as a function of k

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.970 align:middle line:90%
over n for a fixed function f.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you get.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So output-- I have here
capital per worker and output

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.740 align:middle line:90%
per worker.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.343 align:middle line:84%
And you see that obviously
it's in an increasing function.

00:48:06.343 --> 00:48:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The more capital per worker you
have, the more output per worker

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.930 align:middle line:90%
you produce.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.240 align:middle line:90%
But it's also concave.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is it concave?

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:20.493 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.493 --> 00:48:22.035 align:middle line:84%
That's decreasing
returns to capital.

00:48:22.035 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.050 align:middle line:84%
When you have very little
capital per worker,

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:84%
a change in capital
per worker gives you

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.360 align:middle line:84%
a big jump in output
per worker because there

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:90%
was very little capital.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That was a problem
with that economy.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
When the economy has
more and more capital,

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.190 align:middle line:84%
the same change in capital
leads to a much smaller change

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:90%
in output.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Here at this level, when
capital per worker was very low,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.310 align:middle line:90%
the economy was very poor.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Then this change led to this
change in output per capita.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:59.010 align:middle line:84%
At this level of wealth
you get as capital,

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.460 align:middle line:84%
economists would hire capital
richer, capital per worker,

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:90%
the same change.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.640 align:middle line:84%
This change is of the
same size as that.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Leads to a much smaller
change in output.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a result of
decreasing returns to capital.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's the other option.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's what we're
going to talk about

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.020 align:middle line:90%
in the next lecture.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.710 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And two lectures
from now, we're going

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to talk about growth that comes
from shifts in the production

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.060 align:middle line:84%
function, this
technological progress.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.540 align:middle line:90%
See you on Wednesday.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:44.000 align:middle line:90%
