00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
OK, let's start.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So what you have
there in that picture

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is the result of a survey to
a bunch of economists on--

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:84%
which are asked to
assess the probability

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that there is a recession
within the next 12 months.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Recession means, essentially,
a decline in aggregate output.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And well, the first
thing to notice here

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
is that it's not very good news.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
There are very high
chances that, at least

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
according to these
experts, that the US enters

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
a recession within the
next 12 months or so--

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:90%
pretty high probability.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
You can see that that number
typically is very, very low,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and it goes very high sort
of next to recessions.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And now we're not
in a recession,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
but there is a sort
of very high perceived

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
probability that we may go into
a recession in the near future.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that these people
come up with this forecast?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some level, either
explicitly or implicitly,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
they must have some model of
the termination of equilibrium

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And they need to understand--

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
they need to see
certain things that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
suggest, once you go through a
model, that output will decline.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're going
to start doing today.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's
what we're going

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to do throughout this course.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to find
evermore complex, perhaps,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
or richer models of output
determination, aggregate output

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
determination.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially
what this course is about.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.648 align:middle line:90%
And so an understanding.

00:01:57.648 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try
to understand what

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is it that drives
equilibrium output,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and how is it that we get to
one specific level of output.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means to find
the equilibrium level of output.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do it
sort of in three stages.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
In the first part of the
course-- that is, up to quiz 1--

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to focus on the
very short run, how output

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
is determined in the very short
run, say within a year or so--

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or a little more even, but
that type of frame, time frame.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
focus on the medium run.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of at the
beginning of the second part

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:90%
of the course.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And by the medium
run, simply we're

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
going to mean by the time
in which prices begin

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
to adjust sufficiently, OK?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it's most of the
action happens in quantities.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
There is little movement
in goods prices.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of movements
in asset prices,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
but little movement
in goods prices.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
part of the course,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at
how output is determined

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
over the long run, which is
quite different from how output

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:90%
is determined in the short run.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The determination of
output in the short run

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
is what we mostly mean by
business cycle analysis.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And short or medium run, the
way we're going to find it here,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
is what we mean by business
cycle-- the country's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
in a recession, it's in
a boom, is an expansion.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are all terminologies
of the short run

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:90%
or short or medium run.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
The termination of equilibrium
output in the long run

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:90%
is when we think about growth.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about why China
grows faster than the US today,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
well, that's a question not
about the business cycle.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a question about
the long-run determinants

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:90%
of output growth, OK?

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And they are even
different class of models.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
In more advanced models,
if you were doing a PhD,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
those things are a lot
closer to each other.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:90%
But in this course.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be very
different type of models.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to
analyze these things

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
with different type of models
than trying to integrate

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
all in one big machine, OK?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with
the simple part.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
In the short run,
the key mechanism,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
something that will keep
showing up in all the models

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and submodels we analyze
in the first eight lectures

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
or so or seven
lectures-- the next seven

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
lectures or so is
this mechanism.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:90%
In the very short run, output--

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that is, equilibrium output, the
thing that these economists are

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
forecasting that will decline
in within the next 12 months--

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
is determined primarily
by what we call demand.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:90%
So demand will determine output.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Thus, if there's a
change in demand,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:90%
that will change production.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.375 align:middle line:84%
But when production changes,
that will also change income.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That you know from
national accounts.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we said that
we could measure output

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
from the production side but we
also measured the income side.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're exactly the same.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
More production, somebody has to
receive the proceeds of that--

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
workers and owners, capital
owners, the government,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So changes in-- so the second
step is changes in production

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that were brought about
by the changes in demand

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:90%
will lead to a change in income.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But when income changes, that
will change demand again and so

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:90%
on and so forth, OK?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially-- that's
quintessential short-run macro,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
this aggregate demand,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
main driver, and then

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
how it gets multiplied
in the short run, OK?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
In this lecture, we're going to
talk just about that, primarily

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.015 align:middle line:84%
But that's one-- so when I
mean short-run macro, that's

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:90%
a structure I have in mind.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.012 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
people have in mind,

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
something where aggregate
demand will determine that.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
why, in the short run,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.827 align:middle line:84%
you worry a lot about whether
consumer confidence is

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:90%
high or low.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:90%
That's demand.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:84%
If consumers are very depressed,
they tend to reduce demand.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
If consumers are
very bullish, that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:90%
will tend to increase demand.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And since, in the
short run, output

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is determined by demand,
the business cycle,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
whether we have a
recession or not,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
depends a lot on
how demand feels.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's forecasting
a recession within the next 12

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:84%
months, is forecasting really
that demand will decline

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:90%
within the next 12 months, OK?

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Why they're forecasting
that-- that's something

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn in steps
as we go through the course.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
What are the kind of things
they may be thinking about?

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
What are the drags
on aggregate demand

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that are likely to depress
demand and so on and so forth?

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get there, OK?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, first, let me tell
you about the components

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of aggregate demand.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:90%
The first and one of--

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the largest component of
aggregate demand is consumption.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
aggregate demand--

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll be--

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll pause for a slide.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Let me go over the definition.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Consumption-- we're
going to denote by C--

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
is the goods and service
purchased by consumers,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
households, and so on.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Investment, which we're
going to denote by I,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:84%
is the sum of nonresidential
and residential investments--

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
so equipment and
factories on one side,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and then residential investment
is houses, stuff like that,

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
apartment buildings and
so on, which is also--

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
these are goods and services, as
well, capital goods and so on.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.698 align:middle line:84%
But they're are also
goods and services.

00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Government spending-- that's
what we're going to denote

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
by G-- are purchases of goods
and services by the federal,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
state, and local
government, excluding--

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that's important--
government transfers.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
What is a government transfer?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Many of you may have
received that during COVID.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
The government sent you
a check, for example, OK?

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, that check is not part
of government expenditure.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
That check is like
a-- is a negative tax

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and is going to
enter somewhere else.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
When we mean
government expenditure

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is things the government
purchases, services

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the government
acquires and so on, OK?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And then exports, X, which
will play no role until seven

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:84%
lectures, eight
lectures from now,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
or actually 10 lectures
from now probably,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
is purchases of US goods
and services-- that is,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
goods produced by US factories--

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:90%
by foreigners.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
IM is the other side
of the story, inputs.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the purchase of
foreign goods and services

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
by US consumers, US
firms, US government.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you buy something
that is produced in Germany,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:90%
well, that's an import.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:84%
When the Germans
buy something that

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
is produced in the US,
that's an export, OK?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
component is something

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to pay
any attention whatsoever

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
in this course, which
is inventory investment.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Inventory investment
is certainly--

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:90%
it's almost accidental.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
There is some planning on it,
but there is a lot of-- it's

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
just when there's difference
between sales and production.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And over the very short run,
there's lots of differences.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not producing--
unless you're in a bakery,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
you're not producing
and selling immediately.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:90%
There are certain lags.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a small thing.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It's volatile, but
it's a small thing.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to ignore
it for this course.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.455 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume,
actually, unless we explicitly

00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
say the contrary, and that
could show up in a pset.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.168 align:middle line:84%
It would never show in a quiz,
because it's not that important.

00:09:23.168 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume that
this inventory investment is

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:90%
equal to 0.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Also, for this part of the
course, until further notice,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to assume that
exports and imports are

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
equal to 0 as well.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
That's not realistic,
but it's easier

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.163 align:middle line:84%
to analyze what we call a
closed economy, an economy that

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
is not interacting with
the rest of the world.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.275 align:middle line:84%
In, again, 10 lectures
from now, we're

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
going to open the economy
to the rest of the world,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to have to talk

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.917 align:middle line:84%
about things like
import/exports, exchange rates,

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:90%
things of that kind.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But for now, let's
keep it simple, OK?

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, so you get a
sense, this is for 2018.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the totals change,
but the composition doesn't

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
change very much, of GDP--

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of GDP output, aggregate demand.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
They're are all the
same in equilibrium,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
but we'll get there.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
In GDP, you see that consumption
accounts for a big chunk, close

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:90%
to 70% of aggregate demand.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason people worry
so much about consumer sentiment

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.473 align:middle line:84%
University of Michigan
has many claims to fame.

00:10:33.473 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is that they
produce its index of consumer

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:90%
sentiment.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
watching that thing.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that worries
about macro or finance

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
is watching that thing
because it tells you

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot about one of the main
drivers of output, equilibrium

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you see investment
is substantially smaller,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
but it's large, in particular,
nonresidential investment.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Government expenditure is a big
component of aggregate demand.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm not going
to worry too much about--

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
for a country like the
US, the openness part

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
is relatively small.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:90%
If you go to a--

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
a small economy typically will
have sort of very large exports

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:90%
relative to GDP and so on.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
case of the US.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And there you see why
we're going to set

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:90%
inventory investment to 0.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a small thing.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It moves a lot
more than its size,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.595 align:middle line:84%
so it can account for
fluctuations in sort

00:11:32.595 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:90%
of the monthly level of GDP.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that important in a
slightly longer period of time,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.695 align:middle line:84%
So that's more or
less the story.

00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:90%
So now this is the model.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Please stop me.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything here
you don't understand,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
because everything that we
build from here to quiz 1

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
will build on understanding
this, what I'm about to say.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, but if
you miss a step here,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
everything is going
to be confusing

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
in the next few lectures.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're not supposed to
understand it in the first run,

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.655 align:middle line:90%
so it's OK that you ask me.

00:12:06.655 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's make sure
that you understand

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:90%
what is going on here.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's aggregate demand.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
First, definition-- so we're
going to denote aggregate demand

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
by this Z, letter Z. And
aggregate demand is going

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
when we say aggregate
demand, remember

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
what is the exercise
we're trying to do.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, what we
want to determine

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
is the output, the production
of the US economy, say.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we meet-- when we
talk about aggregate demand,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to
determine the demand

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
for domestically produced goods,
for goods produced in the US.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
trying to pin down.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason
aggregate demand looks

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:90%
like that, is, well, consumers.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Consumers are going
to demand goods.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Investment, G, plus exports.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
If foreign demands
US goods, that also

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
increases US production--
minus imports

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
because imports is goods and
services that consumers, firms,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and governments sort
of buy from foreigners,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're not produced
by US companies.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So they do not affect the
determination of equilibrium

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.193 align:middle line:90%
output in the US, OK?

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
you subtract it.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, that distinction
is not going

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
to matter until 10 lectures
from now, because we're

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:84%
going to set X and IM equal
to 0 from the point of view

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.490 align:middle line:90%
of modeling.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So all demand is demand for
domestically produced goods

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the course, OK?

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So aggregate demand for US
will be this C plus I plus G.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So we need to understand what
determines C plus I plus G.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And at least
initially, we're going

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.757 align:middle line:90%
to keep it very, very simple.

00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to think
too much about what

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.247 align:middle line:90%
determines investment.

00:13:46.247 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're going to assume
that it's a constant, is given.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.247 align:middle line:84%
So it's determined
somewhere else,

00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
not in the model
I'm about to solve.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.062 align:middle line:84%
Government
expenditure, the same--

00:13:56.062 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume
it's determined

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
by some other priorities, green
agendas and stuff like that.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It has very little to do
with what we're doing here.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And then taxes is something
that doesn't show up there,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.402 align:middle line:84%
but it will show
up very shortly.

00:14:09.402 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to
assume that they have

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:90%
been determined somewhere else.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:84%
In psets and later
on in the course,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to endogenize
all that, but not now.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume-- I'm
trying to come up

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
with the simplest possible
model of aggregate demand.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm making two of these
terms trivial, just constants,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to focus all my
effort here in this component

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
here, which I
already told you is

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the most important component
of aggregate demand, which

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is consumption, OK?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to assume--

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
here we're going
to have a function.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Something has to move for
the model to be interesting.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So this-- we're going to
assume that consumption

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing function
of disposable income.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to define what
disposable income is,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:90%
but you can imagine what it is.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can
use to consume and so on.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So very naturally, if you have
a higher disposable income,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
you're going to consume more.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what this says, OK?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
In reality, that consumption
function is a lot more complex.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of things that
enter there that we're not

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
modeling for now.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's start
from the basics, OK?

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be the only
behavioral assumption we're

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
going to make for a while,
that the consumers consume

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:84%
more when they have
more disposable income.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to get even simpler.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to assume that
consumption is a linear function

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:90%
of this disposable income.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be some
constant C0 which captures lots

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of things that we're not
modeling here-- for example,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
the fact that, for any given
level of disposable income,

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
if you--

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
if you're richer, suppose
you have some shares,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and now the shares
double in value,

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
you probably are going
to consume more as well.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of other
things that affect consumption

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:90%
which are different from--

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.593 align:middle line:84%
aside from your
disposable income.

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going
to model that.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So thus, we're going
to call it autonomous,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
autonomous in the
sense that we're not

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:90%
going to determine it here.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
it as a parameter that

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:90%
comes from somewhere else.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
We may do some experiments
moving that variable around,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to be
part of what we model.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
C1 is a more
interesting parameter

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:90%
for this part of the course.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we call the
marginal propensity to consume--

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
out of disposable
income, in this case.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That is, C1 tells you the share.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
If you get an extra dollar
of disposable income,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
how much of that do you
spend in consumption?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So say you get an
extra dollar of income.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
If you spend $0.60 in the things
you normally consume of that

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
extra dollar, well,
then your C1 is 0.6, OK?

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.438 align:middle line:84%
That's the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives us
our increasing function.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
If you get an extra
dollar, you're

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
going to do-- you're going
to save part, but some of it

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
you're going to spend.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
That part you're going
to spend is the C1

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.805 align:middle line:90%
that we have there, OK?

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:03.305 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell you how we
define disposable income.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Disposable income is
just equal to income,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to
production, minus taxes.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:90%
That's disposable income.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever you earn as a
worker or as a capital owner--

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
well, then the government
takes some out of it.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.162 align:middle line:84%
That's your disposable
income, and that's

00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
what you have to decide how much
to save and how much to consume.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So that means that our
consumption function

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
can be written that way after
all these assumptions I've

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:90%
made--

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.612 align:middle line:84%
equal to its autonomous
component plus C1,

00:17:46.612 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.435 align:middle line:84%
times income,
output, minus taxes.

00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it clear?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:90%
So all these are assumptions.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're not crazy
assumptions in the sense

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that we know that there is a
relationship between these two

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, the consumption
function in practice

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:90%
is much richer than that.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is lots of randomness,
random terms around and so on.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.213 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
we're about here.

00:18:17.213 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- if you want
to start with a consumption

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
function, this is a pretty
reasonable one to start with,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's going to look in
the space of disposable income,

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:90%
or income--

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I could have put income
there, not disposable income--

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
so that it looks like that.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.477 align:middle line:84%
So C0 is that
autonomous consumption.

00:18:37.477 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's something you're
going to consume

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.977 align:middle line:84%
regardless of your level
of disposable income.

00:18:40.977 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And there is a minimum
consumption you have to have.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And then
the slope of that

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
which is C1, which is a
number between 0 and 1.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's determine
equilibrium output.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have aggregate demand,
which is C plus I plus G, OK?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
There we are.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That was our definition
of aggregate demand.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stick in
now the functional forms.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys
are very boring.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:90%
They're constants.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm plugging in here
the consumption function.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here is
that aggregate demand is

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:84%
an increasing function
of output, or income, OK?

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It's also a function of
taxes, investment, and so on.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's an increasing
function of output.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is important because,
remember, the goal of this

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.640 align:middle line:90%
is to find equilibrium output.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So here I have, on
the right-hand side

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:90%
of my aggregate demand, output.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I have one equation in which
output shows up, [CHUCKLES] OK?

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I cannot find equilibrium
output just from this equation.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we're
trying to build a model

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:90%
to find equilibrium output.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.857 align:middle line:90%
That's our goal.

00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what will tell us whether
we're in a recession or not--

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.975 align:middle line:84%
output is low, recession,
output is high, we're in a boom.

00:20:15.975 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I cannot
solve it from this.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I have two unknowns.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:90%
What are my two unknowns?

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Two unknowns, one equation.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
What is my second unknown there?

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:35.808 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: The aggregate demand.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.183 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Aggregate demand, of course.

00:20:39.183 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to determine Z and Y.
So how are we going to do that?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, using a second
equation, which

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:90%
is the equilibrium condition.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not a function.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.802 align:middle line:90%
This is a function.

00:20:51.802 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:90%
This is not a function.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
This is an
equilibrium condition.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It says, in equilibrium--
not outside equilibrium,

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:90%
in equilibrium--

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
output is equal to
aggregate demand.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what this equilibrium
condition tells us.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Off equilibrium,
this doesn't hold.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.098 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason this
is not a function.

00:21:10.098 --> 00:21:11.510 align:middle line:90%
This holds everywhere.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a function.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
This is an
equilibrium condition.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It says, at equilibrium,
aggregate demand

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.433 align:middle line:90%
is equal to output.

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So now we're done because
we have two equations, two

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.785 align:middle line:90%
unknowns, OK?

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I post
on this is that I

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
see that mistake
made often, that this

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.988 align:middle line:90%
is interpreted as a function.

00:21:32.988 --> 00:21:33.488 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It's an equilibrium condition.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:90%
At equilibrium, it holds.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And that you can
see, actually, I'm

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
going to illustrate the
same point in the diagram.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%
let me keep going.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is clear, no?

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
a summary of what

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90%
we had in the previous slides.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.672 align:middle line:84%
And this is the new thing here,
which is, in equilibrium, output

00:21:54.672 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:90%
is equal to aggregate demand.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's what makes
this really a short-term model.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.510 align:middle line:84%
You see, I'm saying
output, in the short term,

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
is whatever demand
wants it to be,

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
which is different
from the long run that

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
says, no, no, hold on a second.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but how much
output you can produce

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
is a function of the capital you
have, of the workers you have.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, that's
true in the long run.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.093 align:middle line:84%
But in the short run, you
have lots of flexibility

00:22:26.093 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because you have lots of
unused capacity and so on, OK?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is pretty--
is a big assumption.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are schools of
thought within macroeconomics

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that are split by
this assumption,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
whether you believe
that, in the short run,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
output is aggregate
demand-determined or not.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.152 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we tend to believe
that in the short run--

00:22:46.152 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:90%
the long run, no.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the short run,
that's what it does.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes the long run
gets to you very quickly.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, we're
in a situation like that.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.605 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we're
seeing inflation and so on.

00:22:56.605 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's something you'll
understand later on, OK?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But for now, so
this is important.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:90%
We're saying here, output--

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't need another equation.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.013 align:middle line:84%
I could have done
aggregate demand like this

00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and then output a function of
capital, labor, lots of things.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to even do that.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, no, no,
output will be whatever

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:90%
demand wants it to be, OK?

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And that means, in equilibrium,
they have to be equal.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Good.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:90%
You had a question.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] can you
[INAUDIBLE] output and GDP

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.931 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:30.056 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: No,
they are the same for us.

00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: They are [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.793 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
That's our definition.

00:23:33.793 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:90%
GDP, for us, is output.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So when they say aggregate
output, I mean GDP.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Real GDP-- we're talking
all about real GDP, OK?

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.792 align:middle line:90%
And it's also equal to income--

00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:84%
not disposable, but
it's equal to income.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we did those
little tables where we look

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE], the three
different ways of doing it?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, the first two were output.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And the last one was income.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And they had to be the same, OK?

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
So Y is real GDP for us?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:90%
That's real GDP.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens, in the
table I showed you,

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.142 align:middle line:84%
I already used the
fact that real GDP

00:24:13.142 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:90%
is equal to aggregate demand.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.767 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason I showed you

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the different components
of Z I showed you

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.602 align:middle line:84%
that, that, and
that, [CHUCKLES] OK?

00:24:20.602 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But in equilibrium,
they are equal.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.432 align:middle line:84%
There's really a figure
that will clarify,

00:24:31.432 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I think, a lot of that.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But let me keep solving this.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.943 align:middle line:90%
So we have that--

00:24:35.943 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:84%
so what I'm going to do
next is just solve it.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.443 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
equilibrium condition.

00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to plug in my
aggregate demand function here.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I can solve out
for equilibrium output.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And here we have,
for the first time

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:84%
in this course, an equation
for equilibrium output.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
That's your equilibrium
output in this economy.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, this guy here
is very famous

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and is very macro It
doesn't happen in micro.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It happens in macro
only, this guy here.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Another guy there is
called the multiplier.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
important macro concept.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge concept in macro.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.412 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you think
it's called a multiplier?

00:25:28.412 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, it
multiplies something.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But a multiplier sounds
like it multiplies--

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:90%
that makes something bigger.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.585 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
C1 is greater than 0?

00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens if C1
is greater than 0.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Remember, it's between 0 and 1.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if
it's greater than 0?

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.455 align:middle line:84%
What happens with that number
there, 1 over 1 minus C1?

00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Bigger than 1.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
It's greater than 1.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.608 align:middle line:90%
It multiplies.

00:26:05.608 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we
call it a multiplier

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:90%
is not nothing deep there.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So this thing here is
sort of autonomous stuff.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what the government
spends, what firms are spending,

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:90%
capital.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
This is autonomous consumption.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
is a typo there.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
There should be a C1
in front of that--

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.010 align:middle line:90%
typo.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes from there, C1 times
T. So fix that typo, please.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to upload the slides
again with the typo fixed, OK?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- it comes
from here, C1 times T.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's what this does.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It multiplies.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that
is happening here,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.017 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that the
government is spending

00:26:47.017 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, this
term is multiplied.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge thing.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
There was a big debate--

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.417 align:middle line:84%
almost always,
when you're trying

00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to get out of a recession, and
the government starts spending,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
a big question is, well,
how big is the multiplier?

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.905 align:middle line:84%
If the multiplier
is small, you're

00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
going to have to spend a
lot to get the economy out

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:90%
of the recession.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:84%
If the multiplier is
large, then you're

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
spend very little,

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and then the multiplier
will take you away

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:90%
from that recession.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.915 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that makes a
multiplier large or small?

00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, mechanically, when is
it that multiplier large?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.530 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: When C1
is closer to 1,

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:84%
so when people are spending
more of their income.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Exactly, when C1 is large.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And that gives you the logic.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
important in macro,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:90%
is why is it a big multiplier?

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, because think
what happens in macro.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The government spends--
not increases output.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:90%
But now output increases income.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And if consumers spend a big
share of their extra income,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
an output, and
consumption again,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
then that increases
output again,

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
which increases the income
again, and you keep going, OK?

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's the sequence.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.778 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, if
consumers are very scared,

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:07.070 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to spend any
extra dollar they receive,

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
anything of the extra dollar
they receive, then you don't get

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:84%
any multiplier, because this
initial increase in output that

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.145 align:middle line:84%
comes from the government
expansion, that does

00:28:16.145 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:90%
lead to increase in income.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But if consumers
don't spend it, it

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
doesn't recirculate
into the economy,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't
get a multiplier.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason we
call it the multiplier.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So that diagram is
an important diagram.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm just doing this, actually.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
In that diagram, I'm plotting
the aggregate demand function

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and then this equilibrium
condition, output

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:84%
equal to aggregate
demand, in the space

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of aggregate demand and output,
production, and income here.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But remember, income is
equal to production, OK?

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's your aggregate
demand and, thus,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.450 align:middle line:84%
your 45-degree line because this
output equal to-- so whatever is

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:84%
in this axis equal to that axis,
that's the 45-degree line, OK?

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's your
equilibrium conditions.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It's, at equilibrium,
these guys here,

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand,
Z, will have to be

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
equal to Y. Those are--
that's traced there.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:90%
This is aggregate demand.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Why is this line
flatter than that?

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Why is aggregate
demand flatter than--

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.115 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.115 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because people don't
spend their entire dollar.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly,
because C1 is less than 1.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So the slope of the aggregate
demand in this space

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is C1, is the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
How much more they demand
if they get an extra dollar?

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, they don't get-- they
don't demand one extra unit.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
They demand C1 unit,
and C1 is less than 1.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reason this.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So if C1 is very small, this
line is going to be very flat.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
If C1 is very large,
very high propensity

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to consume, this is going to
be very steep, the red line.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The other one doesn't
change, the 45-degree line.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And what I said is that, at--

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
so you see, if I take
an off-equilibrium level

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:90%
of output-- say, this--

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand is
different from output.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's only at equilibrium that
these two things will hold.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This function, I can
plot it everywhere.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But this one will hold
only at equilibrium, OK?

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
That's when these
two things are equal.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So what I solve here--

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%
here, I just found this point.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So parameters here
are C0, C1 times T,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.255 align:middle line:84%
and G. They all shifters of this
aggregate demand, up and down.

00:30:52.255 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And that point here
is exactly that.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And all those things
are parameters

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in my aggregate demand.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I really want you to
internalize this diagram.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about it?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Just stare at it a
little because it's

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:90%
going to show up repeatedly.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And later, it's not
going to show up.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But whenever you get
confused, the way

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself out
of that confusion

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to go
back to the diagram.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll remind you when
that's likely to happen.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So you better
understand this diagram.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Play with it.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Move-- here, the only
thing you can move around

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:48.532 align:middle line:84%
is the ZZ, the aggregate
demand curve, OK?

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.365 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is an
equilibrium condition.

00:31:50.365 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] You can't
move that 45-degree line.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:90%
But ZZ, you can move it around.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's do a few exercises.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
One, the most obvious, suppose
that C0 increases by $1 billion.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So autonomous
consumption-- that is,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.177 align:middle line:84%
that level of consumption which
is independent of income--

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:90%
goes up by $1 billion.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And that could be we're
only in a better mood.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Disposable income is
whatever it is today.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But there is great
expectation that the economy

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:90%
will enter a boom next year.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so then you feel
richer and so on.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And you may decide to consume--

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.870 align:middle line:90%
not wait until next year.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:84%
You may decide to
consume more today.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.480 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thought experiment
can be captured by a C0 type

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:90%
shift, go up.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I talk
about consumer sentiment.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, consumer sentiment
is a lot about C0--

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:84%
for any given level of
income, whether consumers

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
are likely to consume more than
they would otherwise or less.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what C0 captures.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's go-- everything
in this model-- there's

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
no dynamics in
this simple model.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So we immediately--
what we know is,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
if you just were to
solve the equation,

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and I tell you what happens to--

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
if output-- what happens
to output if C0 goes up

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.520 align:middle line:84%
by $1 billion, you know that
output will rise by how much?

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep it simple.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Just staring at that equation,
if I tell you autonomous

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
consumption goes
up by $1 billion,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
equilibrium output?

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Goes up by more or
less than $1 billion?

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Or exactly $1 billion?

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.804 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.804 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And the multiplier
is greater than 1.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the output
will increase by more than $1

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
billion, will increase by 1
billion times the multiplier.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:84%
If C1 is 0.5, then it will
increase by $2 billion

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium output.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to get you from
the $1 billion to the $2 billion

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:90%
in steps using the diagram.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what I intend to do next.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So this shift here-- so we're
starting from this equilibrium

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:90%
output here.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
This shift here, boom,
is increasing C0.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.199 align:middle line:90%
That's at $1 billion.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So distance A to
B is $1 billion.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.159 align:middle line:84%
That's because what I did is,
for any given level of output.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
I shift this aggregate
demand up by $1 billion.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Thus, autonomous
consumption, up, OK?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, because output is
whatever demand wants,

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that immediately increases
output by $1 billion.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:84%
So the distance between B
and C is also $1 billion.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Demand increased by $1
billion, boom, output

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:90%
immediately catches up.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So output increases
by $1 billion.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.837 align:middle line:84%
But if output increases
by $1 billion,

00:34:47.837 --> 00:34:49.004 align:middle line:90%
what has happened to income?

00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It also increased by $1 billion.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Income is the same as output.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So income has increased
by $1 billion.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if income has
increased by $1 billion,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and C1 is different from 0, that
means part of that extra billion

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is going to be spent in
consumption, second round.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So say C1 is 0.5, then
now you get $500 million

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.850 align:middle line:90%
more of expenditure.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.580 align:middle line:90%
But if it's-- of consumption.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's $500, that's the CD.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:90%
That's $500 million.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this C1
here is less than 0.5

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise this would
be half of that, but it's not.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you get
$500 million more.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But if now there's $500
million more of demand,

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:84%
since output does
whatever-- production

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:84%
does whatever demand wants, then
you get $500 more of production.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.023 align:middle line:84%
And if you have $500
more, million dollars

00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of more production, then
you have $500 million

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.030 align:middle line:90%
more of income.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
$500 more of income,

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and you have C1 is
greater than 0--

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:84%
say, 0.5-- you're going to
spend $250 million more.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
But $250 million more
will generate $250 million

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
of production, which also
will generate $250 million

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:84%
more of income, which
will generate $125 million

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:84%
more of consumption, and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:90%
You [INAUDIBLE] OK?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- and that's
what is happening here.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLING] Boom.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the movement from C to D

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
From C to D. OK,

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:84%
so this is the initial shift in
aggregate demand up, $1 billion.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That leads to a $1
billion more of production

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:84%
as well, which means $1
billion more of income, OK?

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But now these consumers
not only have this C0--

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
$1 billion higher in C0, but
they also have $1 billion

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.150 align:middle line:90%
more of income.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And since they have $1
billion more income,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
spend part of it--

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.590 align:middle line:84%
C1 times that, and I
assume C1 was 0.5--

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:90%
that's what gives me CD.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the extra $500 million.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then that thing there
is also $500 million.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was $250 million,
$250 million, $125, $125 $62.5.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the way you get there.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
There is an alternative way
of finding equilibrium output,

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:90%
which is entirely equivalent.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way it was
initially done, by the way.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see later on a very
important curve in this course

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
will be the IS curve,
which is a curve that

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:84%
describes all the
equilibrium in goods markets.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it's called IS
because of this alternative way

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of deriving the same I have
derived, which is through--

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
you can arrive to the same
equilibrium by saying,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
look, equilibrium output
is that output at which

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.580 align:middle line:90%
investment is equal to savings.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason that curve
is going to be called IS,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:90%
investment equal to savings, S.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So let me very quickly do it
for you and then make a point

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:90%
and connect the two things.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So private saving is what
consumers do and so on,

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and firms.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just disposable
income minus consumption.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
That's your saving, OK?

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's equal to
Y minus T. That's

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:90%
disposable income minus C.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Government saving is taxes
minus government expenditure.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So if the government has a
deficit, that thing is negative.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Governments often have
negative saving, OK?

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:84%
If it has a surplus, then
taxes are greater than G,

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:90%
then you have a fiscal surplus.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, rarely happens in the US
or in the Americas in general.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
It happens a lot in Asia, but
it doesn't happen very much

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.560 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the world.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:90%
But there we are.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So in equilibrium, investment,
I, has to be equal to saving.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you are going to
use the saving for, to invest,

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So investment is equal
to the sum of savings.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I can replace all
that in here, and you

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:84%
see that I get exactly
the same equilibrium

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.570 align:middle line:90%
condition I had before--

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:84%
output equal to
aggregate demand.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is an entirely
equivalent way of deriving this.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to show
you this because it's

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
the way it was originally done.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
better the terminology

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
we use later on if you see
that this is an equivalent way.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:84%
This is also a nice way
of illustrating something,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:84%
why macro can be
counterintuitive sometimes.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Microeconomics is
very intuitive.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, things make sense.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like physics.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Macro can be confusing.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is a
well-known paradox of savings,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in the short run,
not in the long run.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
In the short run, you have
the paradox of saving.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So we all think that you
save more is a good thing.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Our parents teach us
that is a good thing

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:90%
to save more and so on.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And in general, that is true.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You'll do better in life if you
save a little more and so on.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.075 align:middle line:84%
But it's not true for the
macro in the short run.

00:40:13.075 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not good for
macroeconomics in the short run,

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.840 align:middle line:84%
unless you are in an
overheated economy.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Now it could help.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, it's not very
good for equilibrium output.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And let me show you that very
quickly with the expression

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I just showed you.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said,
equilibrium output

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:84%
is pinned down by
investment equal to saving.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And saving-- the
private saving here

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing
function of output, OK?

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's equal to,
actually, 1 minus--

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.006 align:middle line:84%
the function has a
slope of 1 minus C1.

00:40:49.006 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
C1 is the share of income
that you spend in consumption.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, 1 minus C1 is
the share of your income

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.860 align:middle line:90%
that you spend in saving, OK?

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So this function is increasing
with a slope of 1 minus C1.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So suppose I tell
you now that all we

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
decided to learn the
lessons of our parents

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, we
should all save more.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So that means, for any
given level of income,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:90%
now we all decide to save more.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:17.570 align:middle line:84%
That means the S
function shifts up.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:84%
For any given level of
income, we save more.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have a problem there
because now we have more savings

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:90%
than investment.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So how do we
restore equilibrium?

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not in equilibrium.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
How do we restore equilibrium?

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So now we all decided to be more
prudent and save a little more.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:84%
At the level of the
economy as a whole,

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:84%
now we have more
saving than investment.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That can't happen.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not an equilibrium.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:90%
What restores equilibrium?

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this very simple
model, our investment is fixed.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So nothing can adjust
on the investment side

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's fixed.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it's going to
move, but now it's fixed.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can adjust in
the public savings part

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.990 align:middle line:90%
because it can't move.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:90%
We assume that it's exogenous.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So something has to
happen endogenously

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.428 align:middle line:84%
here that the reverses
the increase in savings,

00:42:16.428 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:90%
the only thing that can happen.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing can
happen endogenously here

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.205 align:middle line:90%
is a decline in output--

00:42:22.205 --> 00:42:24.510 align:middle line:84%
output declines,
saving declines.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So here you end
up in a situation

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in which we all decided
to be better people,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:90%
save a little more.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up sinking the
economy in a recession--

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.843 align:middle line:90%
output decline.

00:42:36.843 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason it's
called the paradox of saving.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.322 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.322 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to happen
to you individually,

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.470 align:middle line:84%
but to an economy
as a whole, that's

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the reason I said
it's counterintuitive.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.485 align:middle line:90%
It can happen.

00:42:48.485 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.605 align:middle line:84%
So look, if you don't
like this way of--

00:42:57.605 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's not the main
way we're going to use.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.855 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like this way of
finding equilibrium output,

00:43:01.855 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:90%
just ignore it.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted you to know it.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Go back to-- the thing you
really need to understand

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.320 align:middle line:90%
is not this.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's this, that, that.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.530 align:middle line:90%
That you need to understand.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So let me illustrate
the paradox of saving

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in the model we're
using, in the one

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:90%
I want you to really remember.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the paradox of saving I
can capture by a decline in C0.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:84%
For any given level of income,
now we decide to consume less.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:84%
If we consume less for
any given level of income,

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:90%
that means we're saving more.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So I can capture in
this diagram the fact

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that we have all become
sort of more prudent

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.680 align:middle line:84%
by a decline in
aggregate demand.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But if aggregate
demand declines-- so

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.468 align:middle line:84%
suppose we start at this
equilibrium level of output,

00:43:50.468 --> 00:43:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and then, all of a sudden,
we say, OK, enough is enough.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.490 align:middle line:90%
We need to start saving more.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, aggregate demand declines.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for any given
level of income,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.350 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
save more, that means

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.558 align:middle line:90%
you're going to consume less.

00:44:04.558 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
So aggregate demand declines.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.027 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
aggregate demand declines?

00:44:10.027 --> 00:44:11.110 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Output declines.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Output declines.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:17.174 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
output declines?

00:44:17.174 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.693 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Income declines.

00:44:19.693 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
income declines?

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.517 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of that
income you consume.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.630 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to consume less.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:90%
C1 times that.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So then-- and then you get the
multiplier working against you.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So not only-- if now we
all decide to save more,

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:84%
not only output falls
by the same amount

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that we increase
savings, but actually

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:84%
declines by more than that
because you get the multiplier

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.360 align:middle line:90%
working against you, OK?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason a big role
of policymakers, really,

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.232 align:middle line:84%
in recession is to try to
maintain the calm because you

00:44:57.232 --> 00:44:58.690 align:middle line:84%
can get into these
kinds of things.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's everybody gets scared,
and we all get scared.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So the economy can implode just
out of bad sentiment and so on.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we're on the opposite
side of the cycle.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
We would want output to decline
a little because we are having

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:84%
other problems, inflation
and so on-- again, something

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:90%
we'll discuss later.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So now you may want to
scare consumers a little.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:34.227 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the governance
of the Federal Reserve--

00:45:34.227 --> 00:45:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and the same is happening in
other places in the world--

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:90%
are doing just that.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they go out there,
says the economy is too hot,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to mess
up this economy a little.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They're
telling us that.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is
listen to these things

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:90%
is the financial markets.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So every time they come out
and make a speech of that kind,

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:90%
equity markets decline.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, equity markets
capture before the mood

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that consumers will have in
the future, captures it early.

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.470 align:middle line:90%
But that's the message, OK?

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying--
at this moment,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:84%
really, policymakers-- at
least the central banks--

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.990 align:middle line:84%
are trying to do just that,
depress a little bit consumers

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:84%
so we can cool off
the economy a bit.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, very important
lecture because we're

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
going to build on this
and, later on, this

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is going to be always
in the background.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And of this-- until
we actually go

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to the third part of the course,
the key model will be this.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:90%
This will be in the background.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
More things will be
happening on top.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But whenever I ask
you a question--

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, later--
ah, one example--

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:54.930 align:middle line:84%
what else would produce
a situation like this?

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:90%
What else-- what could happen?

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:03.902 align:middle line:84%
What kind of policy would
generate that movement?

00:47:03.902 --> 00:47:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this point, we haven't
introduced monetary policy.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot talk
about monetary policy.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:13.055 align:middle line:84%
But we do have other kinds of
policy we could talk about.

00:47:13.055 --> 00:47:24.060 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Here, fiscal policy.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Fiscal policy.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
G and T, those are
fiscal parameters.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:84%
When G goes down
or T goes up, we

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.470 align:middle line:84%
call that contractionary
fiscal policy.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Why contractionary?

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it contracts
aggregate demand.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.560 align:middle line:84%
If G goes down, clearly
aggregate demand

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.790 align:middle line:90%
goes down immediately.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:55.580 align:middle line:84%
If T goes up, well,
disposable income

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:84%
for any given level
of income goes down,

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and therefore,
consumption goes down.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So we call an increase-- a
decline in G or an increase in T

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:90%
a contractionary fiscal policy.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.910 align:middle line:84%
The opposite-- if G goes
up, and T goes down,

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:84%
we call that an
expansionary fiscal policy.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So I take you back
to this diagram here.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I ask you the
question again,

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
what kind of fiscal policy
will generate this type of--

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.040 align:middle line:90%
this picture?

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Contractionary or expansionary?

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Contractionary

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.132 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Contractionary.

00:48:35.132 --> 00:48:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a good mnemonic,
the output decline.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So contractionary-- so that is
a decline-- a reduction in G,

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.100 align:middle line:90%
in going expenditure.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Or an increase in taxes
will shift that curve down.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the multiplier will
make it even more contractionary

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.595 align:middle line:90%
than the initial fiscal impulse.

00:48:52.595 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Very good, see you on Wednesday.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:13.000 align:middle line:90%
