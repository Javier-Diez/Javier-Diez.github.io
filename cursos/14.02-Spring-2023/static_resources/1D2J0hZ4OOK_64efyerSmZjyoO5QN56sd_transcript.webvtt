RICARDO CABALLERO:
OK, let's start.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So by now, you know
the IS-LM model,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't fully control
it, please spend a lot of time

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
As I said, 2/3 of your
quiz will be about that.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
start adding a few--

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
it's a very basic
model, but still we

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
can squeeze a lot
of insight from it.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
very natural extensions

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that I think we should also go
over and cover because, again,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
they have a high return
in terms of investment

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:90%
to knowledge acquired from them.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And today, I want to
extend this IS-LM model

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:90%
along two realistic dimensions.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The first one is to
make a distinction

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
between nominal and
real interest rates.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, nominal, up to now,
since we assume in the model,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
since we assume that prices
were completely fixed,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
constant, there is no
inflation, and then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
there is no distinction between
nominal and real interest rates.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But needless to say, we
live in an environment

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
with inflation is positive,
typically, not always,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:90%
but typically.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, nowadays we're
having very high inflation.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of one of the
big macroeconomic headaches

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have at this moment
is a very high inflation rate

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not going to
talk about the determination

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of inflation until
later in the course.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start talking
about that in the next lecture,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and it will not be part
of your quiz, though.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, not in the next
lecture, next week,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
but will not be
part of your quiz.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It will be a very important part
of quiz 2, but not of quiz 1.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But we can still
say a few things

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
about what happens to the
framework we have, conditional

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.873 align:middle line:84%
or taking as a
parameter inflation.

00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to determine
inflation [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.643 align:middle line:84%
but we say, well, what happens
if inflation is not really 0?

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
what happens

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
if people don't expect
inflation to be really 0?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see how that
modifies the analysis.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The second extension is that
we simplify financial markets

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
enormously and we
customize it to--

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we could have simplified
along many dimensions,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
but the simplification
that we have is we

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
look at something that is
closest to what central banks do

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
in setting monetary policy.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
trade between cash deposits

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:90%
at the central bank and bonds.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
US government bonds,
in the case of the US,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
typically have very
short maturity,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we had
in mind, and that's

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the way we determine
the interest rate.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, needless to
say, there are many,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
many interest rates in the
economy, different duration,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
one-year rate, two-year rate,
three, ten, 30-year rates.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Some countries have
100 year rates.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
another dimension, which

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
is very important, is the
one that I highlighted

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
there, which is riskiness.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
US Treasury bonds,
especially of short duration,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:90%
are riskless assets.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no risk
associated to it.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a little event
with the debt ceiling fight

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that may happen in
August, September.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's really concerned
that something major

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
will happen, except for a few
disruptions for a few days.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.675 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope that's true.

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Up to now, if you
look at all the risk,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
markets are behaving as if
nothing will happen there.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But corporations don't
typically borrow at those rates.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Corporations issue
their own bonds

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
or take loans from the
banks, and those bonds often

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
have a risk premium.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
That is, they're equal to the
safe interest rate, the Treasury

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
rate, if you want,
plus something else.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you can anticipate
that will be important

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
because interest rates enter
into our IS-LM analysis

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
precisely through the borrowing
costs of firms in the investment

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a
wedge there, if there

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is a spread between what the
rates we've been talking about

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and the rate at which
firms can actually borrow,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.474 align:middle line:90%
then that wedge will matter.

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:43.162 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we want to do.

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%
So we want to introduce this.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to explain
what these things are,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going
to modify our IS-LM

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
model to take into
consideration these extensions.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
nominal interest rate?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have been talking about
the nominal interest rate, which

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
we typically denote by
little i, is the interest

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:90%
rate in terms of dollars.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So if the interest rate is
10%, you buy a bond today,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that bond will give you 10%
of whatever amount of money

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
you invest in the bond
at the end of the year.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's a one-year bond.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.895 align:middle line:84%
So that's a nominal
interest rate.

00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy 100 in bonds
today and the nominal interest

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
rate 10%, you receive $10 of
interest payments one year

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
from now, $10 of
interest payment.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
A real interest rate
is the interest rate

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a basket of goods.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.595 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So the CPI or something like
that will be important in that.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Ex-ante, that is at
the moment in which you

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
are deciding where to
invest in the real bond

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.852 align:middle line:90%
or the nominal bond.

00:05:57.852 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The difference between the
two, the main difference--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.153 align:middle line:84%
there are other issues
that have to do with risk

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] I'm not
going to talk about.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But the main difference between
these two is expected inflation.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you expect no
inflation, then the distinction

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
between goods, that is, if you
expect p to remain constant,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
the distinction between an
interest rate in dollars

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
or in goods isn't existent.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:90%
They're the same.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you expect
inflation, then that's

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
not the case because
the goods are

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
going to become more
expensive over time.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And if the goods become
more expensive over time,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that means something
that pays you in dollars

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
is paying you more
per equal unit.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So if the r, little r,
which is the interest rate,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is equal to i, and you
expect inflation to be 10%,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
really you're expecting
the real instrument

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to pay you 10% more
than the other.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
That cannot happen
in equilibrium,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.752 align:middle line:84%
but that's what it means because
one is paying you in dollars

00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and the other one is
paying you in goods,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:84%
so it will be 10% more
expensive next year.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So why do we care about the
distinction between nominal

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and real interest rate?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.653 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the private
sector, important decisions

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
of the private sector,
like the purchase

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
of durable goods for
consumers-- we're

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.255 align:middle line:84%
not modeling that
in this course,

00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:17.802 align:middle line:84%
but investment in the case
of physical investment, not

00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
financial investment,
physical investment

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
depends on real rates,
not nominal rates.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So what determines
whether the opportunity

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
cost of a real
investment is high or low

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.295 align:middle line:84%
is the real interest rate,
not the nominal interest rate.

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:35.985 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's the case?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:48.607 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.607 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think it's the
real, not the nominal interest

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:90%
rate that matters?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.764 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:56.472 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because when
they're borrowing,

00:07:56.472 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Not really.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the borrowing in
the US is done in nominal rates.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So it has to come
from something else.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Why do you invest?

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
You invest to produce
more goods in the future.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So if those goods
are going to be

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
more expensive in the
future because of inflation,

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
then what matters to
you is the difference

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:84%
between the cost of
borrowing and what

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
you'll get for those goods.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And the goods are going
to be 10% more expensive,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
so what really matters
is the net for you.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if the real
interest remains constant,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and now you give me interest
rates that are 10% higher,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but you also tell me
that the goods are

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
going to be selling are going
to be 10% more expensive,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't change my decision.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If it was a good project
with zero inflation,

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
it's also a good project
with 10% inflation.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:90%
That hasn't changed.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you 30%,
the same thing.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
No, because I'm going to
be investing now in order

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to get things that are going
to be 30% more expensive a year

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So the decision that
doesn't depend on that.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
the real interest

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:84%
rate is what you really
care about in the case

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.828 align:middle line:90%
of real investment.

00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're talking
about real investment

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:90%
at the aggregate level.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.425 align:middle line:84%
All this can make a difference
at the level of individual goods

00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:84%
because when inflation goes up,
not every goods price goes up

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:90%
by the same amount.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Some goods go up by more and
some prices go up by less.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But on average, it's
what I just said.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to look at this
equivalence more formally,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
how to derive the
real interest rate.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, [INAUDIBLE] I said, not
in the US, but in many places,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
you do borrow in real terms.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Chile,
we have a unit of account

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
because we had very high
inflation many years back,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
which is called
Unidad de Fomento,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and that unit of account
is indexed to inflation.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So you borrow $10 million
equivalent in Unidad de Fomento.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.992 align:middle line:84%
And those 10 million
pesos equivalent

00:10:02.992 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Unidad de Fomento that
means the interest

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:90%
rate is indexed to that.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But in the US, that
happens very rarely.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:90%
The US government does do that.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It's called TIPS.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:90%
So you have nominal bonds.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The great majority of
the US Treasury bonds

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
are nominal bonds, but there
are also some real bonds,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and those are
indexed to inflation.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But firms very rarely
can issue bonds in the US

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that are in real terms.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's that [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes this is even a--

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
so the reason I made
that clarification here

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to derive
the real interest rate,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean that
the instrument exists.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, given a nominal
rate that I see out there,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:84%
how do I construct
a real interest

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
rate from that
nominal interest rate?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to hear.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that there
is an instrument that

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:90%
is traded in real terms.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But when I go to
the bank as a firm

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and I borrow at
10% nominal, I need

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to calculate, well, what does
that imply in real terms.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
going to illustrate now.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.772 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I shouldn't
use the word good

00:11:16.772 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:90%
since we're going to do this.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to pin down
is this real interest rate, r.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So the real interest
rate in terms of goods

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
means if I borrow, say, one unit
or if I buy an instrument that--

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
if I spend one unit of the good,
the aggregate good, in a bond,

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
then I receive 1 plus rt units
of goods one year from now,

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
then rt is the
real interest rate.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an interest rate
in terms of goods.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose that I
go this route instead.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So OK, that's what
I want to get to,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
but let me do it through the
only instrument I have, say,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
the nominal interest
rate, the nominal bonds.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So if I buy one
unit of goods today,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that means I'm really buying
Pt dollars in that bond.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Pt.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Is the deflator we have.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
We have Pt dollars.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pt dollars invested
in a nominal bond

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
will give me 1 plus it,
the nominal interest rate,

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:90%
times those dollars.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So say the price index here
is 2 and the nominal interest

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
rate 10%, then next period,
I get a 2 times 1.1.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the number
of dollars I get.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's still--

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I cannot compare with this up
here, because at this point,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
I have dollars.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And really, I want to
convert it into goods.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to go from
goods to goods.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So how do I convert
dollars into goods?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I divide by the
price of the goods,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but not here, by the price
of the goods at t plus 1

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to get
this amount of dollars at t

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 one year from
now, I have to divide

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:84%
by the price of
goods at t plus 1

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in order to get the number of
goods I'm getting at t plus 1.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So I have to divide by plus 1.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that at time
t, I don't know what Pt plus 1

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:90%
will be.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
The best I can do--

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and here's where I'm
simplifying things

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot-- is to have an
expectation of what the price

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:90%
level will be one year from now.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So the best I can do when I
want to compare things today,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:84%
whether I want to go
this way or that way,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:90%
is to use expected price here.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So these two things are
equivalent in the sense

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that they require exactly
the same investment.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm now going this way.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And then in
expectation, at least,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.022 align:middle line:84%
these two things are also
equivalent because this

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
is one I'm going to
get in terms of goods

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
from having invested a good.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what I expect to
get in terms of goods,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
but I'm ignoring all that
uncertainty around that.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I get if I go
directly to the route, the goods

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
route, and this
is two things have

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:90%
to be equal by indifference.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
If two things give me the same,
they have to be priced equally.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
They have to have
the same price.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And so these two things have to
be the same, because here I'm

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:90%
going from goods to goods.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm going
through this channel,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:90%
but also from goods to goods.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
These two things should give us
more or less the same return.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to assume
strictly that they give us

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:90%
the same expected return.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:90%
So this relationship holds.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Is this diagram clear?

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.235 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
going to do now is I'm

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.402 align:middle line:84%
going to take this expression
here and play with it a little.

00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So we arrive in the previous
slide to the conclusion

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that 1 plus the
real interest rate

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 1 plus the nominal
interest rate times Pt over Pt

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 expected.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to denote expected
inflation, the inflation we

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.673 align:middle line:84%
expect, the log change
in the price level

00:15:12.673 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or the rate of
change of the price

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
level from year t to
year t plus 1 as pi e

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:90%
t plus 1 is equal to that.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is expected
inflation at t plus 1.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, do a little algebra, and
I can rewrite this guy here

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
as 1 plus expected inflation
between t and t plus 1.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I just replaced this for 1
over 1 plus pi e t plus 1.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Just algebra, I got that.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So now I have a relationship.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And these things, if this
interest rate is not too high

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and this expected inflation is
not too high, not too large,

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:84%
as it happens in most countries
but a few around the world,

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
then this implies approximately
that the real interest

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
rate is approximately equal
to the nominal interest

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:90%
rate minus expected inflation.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just taking
approximations here.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
intuitive expression.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The real interest rate is
equal to the nominal rate

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
minus the expected inflation.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So if the interest rate is 6%
and expected inflation is 3%,

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
well, the real interest
rate is only 3%.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
In terms of good, you're
going to get 3% less

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:90%
because that's inflation rate.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're borrowing, in terms
of your borrowing costs, well,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cost you
3% less effectively

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
because the goods you're
going to be selling out

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of your investment are going
to be 3% more expensive.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So, look, this is what happened.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you what
happened around the years

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Recession.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Great
Recession happened

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%
end of 2008, 2009, 2010.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Several things you can
see in this picture.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
The white line here is
the nominal interest rate

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
and the yellow is the real
interest rate in the US.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And since in the
US you can actually

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
trade real and nominal bonds,
the difference between these two

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
is expected inflation, as
priced by financial markets.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
in the US are called

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
inflation breakevens, so
swaps, inflation swaps,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:90%
inflation breakevens.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, so several things
you can see in this picture.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that typically,
unless you're in Japan probably,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
the white line, that
is, the nominal rate is

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.060 align:middle line:84%
above the orange line, which
is the yellow line, which

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:90%
is the real interest rate.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's the case?

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Or what does it
tell you, the fact

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that on average sort of
the nominal interest rate

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:90%
is above the real interest rate?

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, on average, in most
advanced economies and even more

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
so in emerging markets,
inflation is positive

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and therefore people expect
inflation to be positive.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, Japan went through this
long periods of deflation,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
but that's a rarity.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
That was an anomaly, what
was going on in Japan.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:90%
But you see something else here.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
There is an episode very
clearly when the opposite

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
was holding, when the real
interest rate went much higher

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:90%
than the nominal interest rate.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is despite the
fact that you see even they

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:90%
cross in opposite direction.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Here there was a sharp decline
in the nominal interest rate

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and a sharp rise in
the real interest rate.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.032 align:middle line:90%
What was happening there?

00:18:58.032 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
First of all, forget
about the picture.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
around 2008, 2009?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:90%
The Great Recession.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's one observation.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Typically, especially
in modern recessions,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:84%
certainly in recessions
caused by financial crisis,

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
as this one was,
real interest rates

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
go above nominal interest rate--
can go above nominal interest

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean in
terms of inflation?

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember, what
the Fed is setting

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.053 align:middle line:90%
is this one, more or less.

00:19:44.053 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
This, I think, is
a one-year rate.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's not exactly what the
Fed set, but more or less.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think the Fed
cut interest rates there very

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:90%
aggressively?

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.943 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we were in the middle
of a big financial crisis,

00:19:56.943 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
so we wanted to
boost the economy,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:90%
so cut the interest rate.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.217 align:middle line:84%
And this is, when you map
it into the very short rate,

00:20:03.217 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
this is effectively the
hit, the zero lower bound.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.590 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't lower it more.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They lower it as much as
they could, and that was it.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So what must have happened
for this real interest rate

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to go up like crazy?

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:90%
How can it be?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
There's the Fed bringing down
the nominal interest rate,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and the real rate,
boom, jumps up.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Expected inflation
went down a lot.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I was saying
is expected inflation

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
is typically positive in
developed economies, around 2%,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:90%
2.5%.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the type of numbers.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
But in deep recessions,
it can go even negative.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.800 align:middle line:84%
There is the
expected inflation as

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
extracted from inflation
breakevens, from the swaps.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And you see, typically
it's around 2% and so on,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
because that's more or less the
Fed inflation target in the US.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
But during this episode
here, we entered

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
into a very deflationary
episode, expected

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:90%
inflation close to minus 4%.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:90%
That was very deflationary.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It was very scary.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.535 align:middle line:84%
Deflations can be very
complicated objects

00:21:13.535 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:90%
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say more
about that later.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
But that's what happened there.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's nominal versus
real interest rate.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me talk
about credit spreads,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
put everything together.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So most bonds issued by
corporations are risky.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They are not-- US treasuries
are as safe as it gets.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
That's considered the safest
assets in the world, together

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
with the German bonds,
government bonds, and Swiss.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
There are a few,
but the US in terms

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of liquidity and everything,
is the premier safe asset

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.026 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But most corporations
don't issue at those rates.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They have to pay a
premium because they're

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
not as safe as those, as
the Treasury instruments.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So let me call that the real
interest rate paid by this bonds

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
by issues by firms on average be
equal to the safe real interest

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:90%
rate plus a premium, xt.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point that is important
is that this risk premium

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
moves a lot over
the business cycle,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
especially when you
have a financial crisis.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.405 align:middle line:84%
People really want to
run away from risk.

00:22:33.405 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it tends to be
higher in recessions,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
especially when recessions
are caused by financial crises

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do we care
about the risk premium?

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, because important
private sector decisions

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
depend on that
real interest rate,

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
on the risk-adjusted
interest rate.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
If a firm has lots of
credibility problems

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.828 align:middle line:84%
and is considered very
risky, the cost of borrowing

00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very
high and therefore it's

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
going to have to have
a higher threshold

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:90%
for any physical investment.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's more costly for
that firm to borrow.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's a reason to worry.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So the risk premium,
that x there,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:84%
is determined by two
things, essentially,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
in the case of bonds.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
There's also risk
premiums in equity.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of
bonds, one thing

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
is the probability
of default. It

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
may be that the firm
doesn't honor those bonds

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and defaults on
them, so one thing

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:90%
is the probability of default.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.338 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the degree of
risk aversion of bond holders.

00:23:36.338 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
There are sometimes in
which you say, look,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
hold any risk here

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
or very little risk
because everything

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:90%
looks very complicated to me.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather go safe.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
I go to Treasury bonds.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this stuff.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So those two reasons
make that spread grow.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
The second reason,
on average, to me

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:90%
is the most important reason.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's easier to
model all this stuff

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.057 align:middle line:84%
as a probability of default.
So that's what I'm assuming.

00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to
do here is I'm going

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.275 align:middle line:84%
to ignore this, the degree of
risk aversion of bondholders,

00:24:04.275 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
just concentrate

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
on the probability
of default of a bond.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But in that sense, you
can model both as the same

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
because you can think
of risk aversion

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
as somebody exaggerating
the probability of default

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of a bond.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:84%
If I get very nervous about
investing in risky stuff,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
there is some true
probability of default

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that some agency is
calculating out there.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm very
nervous about that,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I may as well put a marker
up, say, well, you know,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.572 align:middle line:84%
these guys have
messed up in the past.

00:24:32.572 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They may think that
the probability

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
they followed this bond is
5% during the next year.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to treat it as 10%
because I want to penalize

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:90%
for the risk I'm incurring.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So think of this p here as
a probability of default,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
but as perceived by--

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what is the
true probability of default.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:90%
That's an abstract concept.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's whatever you use
in your investment decisions

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:90%
that I'm modeling here.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So by the same
principle we had before

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
between nominal and real
bonds, what we need to have is

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I need to be indifferent--
in equilibrium,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I need to be indifferent
between investing

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in Treasury bonds, the safe
bonds that pay an interest rt,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and investing in risky bonds
that are paying an interest rate

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:90%
rf, which is greater than rt.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be indifferent
between these two things.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And the spread here
will have to adjust

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
so I'm indifferent between
these two things indeed.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious, if the
probability of default

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.972 align:middle line:84%
is greater than
zero, that this rf is

00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
be greater than r,

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise I don't want
to invest in a bond that pays me

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:90%
the same as that.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, I
can experience a default

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
occasionally, not
get my money back.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here, this
indifference condition means,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, during the next year, there
is a probability of default p.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
That means with
probability 1 minus p,

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get this
high interest rate.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get my money back.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.668 align:middle line:84%
I invest one in a bond,
I get my money back,

00:26:06.668 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
plus an interest rate, which is
higher than the safe interest

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:90%
rate, this rf.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Against that is a probability
that the bond there

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is a default, and I'm going
to assume always in practice

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.342 align:middle line:84%
there is some recovery
of a bond which is

00:26:20.342 --> 00:26:21.550 align:middle line:90%
much less than the principal.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to assume it's 0.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So if p is positive,
as I said before,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
then it better be the case
that this rf is greater than r,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:84%
otherwise I'm not going
to invest anything

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:90%
in the risky bond.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to replace
this rf by rt plus x

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:90%
just to calculate xt.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can solve
this out here, and you

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
get that this risk premium is xt
is an increasing function of p.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, if I perceive bonds
to be more likely to default,

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to require
a higher compensation

00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
if the bond doesn't default.
And that's what you have here.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens is that
during severe recessions,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%
actual defaults go up.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So the probability of
default objectively goes up

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and people get a lot more scared
also that this will happen,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:90%
and so p tends to go up a lot.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So during severe
recessions-- is always

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:84%
almost in recession, but
especially in severe recessions,

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
p can rise a lot.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:90%
It can rise a lot.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:90%
r may fall or not.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:90%
We shall see.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But this stuff
dominates, actually.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This x can move up a
lot during recessions.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if I
show you what happened

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
during the Great Recession,
same episode as before,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
there you have it.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:90%
This is our x really.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Look how it jumped in 2008.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So the average--
and this is for--

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it's high
yield, I think.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not junk.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It's high yield, though.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a weighted
average of things.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But think of this as the median
bond out there, corporate bond.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It had to pay 20% more than a
Treasury bond, so big difference

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
if you are in the private
sector and wanted to borrow,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
than if the government
wanted to borrow.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Big thing.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:90%
This was a big issue.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's almost always--
oh, about that level,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
this is high yield.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So you see, typically
because these high yield,

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:84%
these are not the
prime companies.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:84%
They have a
probability of default.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.182 align:middle line:90%
There's a risk out there.

00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They typically have
to pay a spread, 3%,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:90%
4%, things like that.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But during severe events,
that can go very, very high.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a corporation and
you're trying to borrow here,

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be pretty
difficult to borrow.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the point, not a good
time to invest in that sense.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It pretty expensive.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So that takes me
to the IS-LM model.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to now bring in
these two ingredients.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So the two modifications
I introduce

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:90%
are relevant for the IS.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:90%
The LM doesn't change.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The central bank keeps setting
the nominal interest rate,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it does.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's not
changing, and that's

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:90%
the target of the central bank.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The central bank
may decide to react

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to things that happen in
expected inflation and credit

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:90%
spreads.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But the LM is the
same as it used to be.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
In the book, at some point,
the book makes a simplification

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and it starts setting the
interest rate in terms

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.623 align:middle line:90%
of the real interest rate.

00:29:44.623 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a bad idea,
so I'm not going to do that.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep our IS--

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
our LM as it was, but
now with the extensions,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
we have to modify,
well, the only place

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.320 align:middle line:84%
where interest rate
enters for us, which

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:90%
is in the investment function.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.357 align:middle line:84%
And so the investment
function now

00:30:02.357 --> 00:30:04.315 align:middle line:84%
is not a function of the
nominal interest rate.

00:30:04.315 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a function of the
real interest rate adjusted

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
by credit risk, because that's
the relevant opportunity

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:90%
cost of--

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
that's the real cost of
borrowing, if you will,

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.795 align:middle line:84%
of firms when they
want to invest.

00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:18.335 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.335 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's the modification.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this part of
the course, as I said,

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.397 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take this
as two new parameters.

00:30:26.397 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
look at equilibrium

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:90%
and the termination of that.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:84%
When we get into the
next part of the course,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
then we're never going
to do much about that,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:90%
but yes, about this.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But for now, these are
just two new parameters.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So in our equilibrium lecture,
three in the goods market

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium, now we have
two more parameters,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:90%
expected inflation--

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and remember the ZZ curve, where
we have g, p, interest rate,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.470 align:middle line:90%
all those things are constant?

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we have two new
parameters, expected inflation

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and the credit spread.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:90%
That's lecture 3.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, so what I'm
showing you here

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:90%
is what happened in lecture 3.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:84%
If the credit spreads comes
down or expected inflation rises

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
for any given nominal
interest rate,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
then that shifts
the ZZ curve up.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.285 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And if aggregate demand goes
up, then the multiplier kicks in

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and we end up with an
expansion in output.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying, for a
given nominal interest

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.450 align:middle line:84%
rate, if now expected
inflation goes up

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:84%
or the credit
spreads go down, then

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that acts almost like an
expansionary monetary policy,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
You get an expansion
in aggregate demand.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.777 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Increase
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:51.777 --> 00:31:54.418 align:middle line:84%
because for increased
inflation, the firms

00:31:54.418 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
will be expected to
reduce cost more,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:84%
so they would be more
inclined to invest?

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And for a risk
premium declining,

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.825 align:middle line:84%
they can take and
borrow [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:01.825 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
The cost of borrowing
went up or down for firms.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm saying.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.203 align:middle line:84%
Those two things operate
almost as monetary policy.

00:32:11.203 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:84%
That has not been done
by the Fed, by the way,

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:90%
by the central bank.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.043 align:middle line:84%
But they have the same
effect because that's

00:32:16.043 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
the way they enter.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
They enter exactly the
same as an interest rate.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So saying that this
guy is going up

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:84%
or that this guy
is going down leads

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:84%
to the same analysis
as when we lower i

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:90%
because they're identical.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
They enter exactly
in the same place.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.030 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So what I showed you here, I had
done diagrams like this before.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what you get when
you lower the interest rate.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, the two strokes
describe is effectively

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
like lowering the interest rate
that is the relevant interest

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
rate for the firms
because lower credit

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
spreads, higher
expected inflation

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.950 align:middle line:90%
means lower real interest rate.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the episode I
described you during

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:84%
the global financial crisis
was exact opposite of this.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:84%
In the global financial crisis,
we had this x, boom, jumping.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had shown you before that
expected inflation came down

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
a lot.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, expected inflation
came down a lot when negative,

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:90%
from around 2% to minus 4.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a big shock for the real
cost of borrowing for firms.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And the x went up like crazy.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason in the
global financial crisis

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.010 align:middle line:84%
what we got is exactly
the opposite of this.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We got a massive shift
down in the ZZ curve

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.568 align:middle line:84%
for the reasons
we just described.

00:33:55.568 --> 00:33:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the case for
x going down or pi going up.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
In the global financial crisis,
we got exactly the opposite,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and in massive amounts,
massive increase

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:84%
in x, massive decline
in expected inflation.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
So it's the exact opposite of
this and in a much larger scale.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.409 align:middle line:90%
It was a massive shock.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's the case I
was just describing.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.397 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened in the
global financial crisis.

00:34:23.397 --> 00:34:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is, so if x goes up,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:84%
as it did in the
global financial crisis

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:90%
and the Great Recession--

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.590 align:middle line:84%
by the way, when I say the
global financial crisis

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:84%
or the Great Recession,
those are the same episode.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:90%
They end up being--

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:84%
it started from a
financial crisis,

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out ended up
being a recession everywhere

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.621 align:middle line:84%
and a financial crisis
everywhere as well.

00:34:44.621 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so what I
just described is this.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:53.790 align:middle line:84%
In the IS-LM space, the IS
is shifting inwards a lot.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
For any given nominal interest
rate, if x goes up a lot,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that means there
is less investment

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and that means that
the LM shift to the--

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:90%
sorry, the IS shift to the left.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And the same would
happen if there is

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.030 align:middle line:90%
a fall in expected inflation.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So for the Great Recession,
we have two reasons why

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.350 align:middle line:90%
this thing move inward a lot.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
One, expected
inflation came down,

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and the other one, x went
up a lot, massive movement

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:90%
to the left.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you think a
central bank should do faced

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.682 align:middle line:90%
with a situation like this?

00:35:23.682 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Drop interest rate.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Drop interest rate.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, because this shocks
negative interest rates,

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.638 align:middle line:84%
like, shocks to
the interest rate.

00:35:32.638 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, it's like
if you had increased

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:90%
the interest rate a lot.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the central bank
will try to offset that

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:90%
by lowering the interest rate.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.438 align:middle line:84%
What problem may the central
bank face in doing this?

00:35:46.438 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Reaching
low-liquidity trap.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Yeah,
reaching the zero lower bound

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.025 align:middle line:84%
effectively lowered one
liquidity trap, exactly.

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a limit of
how much you can do.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I showed you that that's
what happened really here.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, this
is-- the reason

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
it looks so flat,
it doesn't move,

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:84%
is because it's against
the lower bound.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It cannot move.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a little bit
about what's happening now.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is now.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the other one was for
the period from 2008 to 2013,

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:90%
I showed you.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm shifting
everything by 10 years.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So still you see, on average,
the white line, which

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.403 align:middle line:84%
is the nominal interest rate,
is above the orange line--

00:36:30.403 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:84%
the orange line--
the yellow line,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:90%
which is the real interest rate.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.302 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:45.510 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Positive inflation?

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Positive inflate--

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:90%
expected inflation.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:90%
But they're correlated.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When inflation is
on average positive,

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
then expected inflation is
also, on average, positive.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:90%
There's an exception there.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:90%
When did that happen?

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:84%
There's one point
where the real interest

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.714 align:middle line:84%
rate went above the
nominal interest rate.

00:37:10.714 --> 00:37:12.858 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: COVID recession.

00:37:12.858 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Sorry.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.983 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: COVID recession?

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:16.358 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:16.358 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:90%
The COVID recession.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.653 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before, that was
a massive shock, a scary shock.

00:37:20.653 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And the initial reaction
of expected inflation

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.420 align:middle line:84%
was to come down enormously,
and so that's what we saw.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And also see this big step here
in the nominal interest rate,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:90%
and then flat.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
happened there?

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, they went
all the way down

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:90%
to the maximum they could do.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
They set the short-term
interest rate to 0 effectively.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly 0, but
to 0, and they stay there

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:90%
for a very long period of time.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, why do you think--

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and this I think helped a lot
the recovery of the US economy,

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and it also a big
reason for the rally

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
that you saw in the
equity market in 2021

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:84%
you can see in this
picture, which is this.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.185 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the real interest
rate went very, very low.

00:38:13.185 --> 00:38:16.498 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.498 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The real interest rate
went very, very low.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
equity markets were flying.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had effectively
very low real interest rates.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:90%
So what happened there?

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:84%
What must have happened
during this episode?

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the central bank
was injecting everything

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.385 align:middle line:84%
possible to it, but even
more than monetary policy,

00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the conventional
monetary policy.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.710 align:middle line:90%
But what is the--

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:90%
let me say this.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.280 align:middle line:90%
This wedge reflects what?

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:54.253 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.253 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
What is that wedge as
a matter of accounting?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Expected inflation.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:90%
It's expected inflation.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you-- this
interest rate was at 0.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The real interest rate
was at minus 4 here.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.443 align:middle line:84%
It means that expected
inflation must have been 4%.

00:39:09.443 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So we had a combination in which
the nominal interest rate remain

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:84%
at 0, but inflation
was high, which

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is not the typical combination
we get in recessions,

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
like the previous one, demand
recessions, financial crises,

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:84%
where inflation goes down
when you are in a recession.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:90%
This was a different shock.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And after the initial shock,
we got lots of bottlenecks

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.000 align:middle line:84%
on the supply side
of the economy, which

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a good model yet.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.723 align:middle line:84%
Later, we're going to
have to model here.

00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you have problems
on the supply side,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.370 align:middle line:84%
you can get a situation in
which it feels recessionary

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:84%
because there is low
activity and so on,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.030 align:middle line:90%
but inflation is high.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we had here.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.495 align:middle line:90%
inflation was high.

00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, at some point,
for a while we

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
tolerated this high
inflation, thinking

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that this was going to be a
transitory phenomenon and so on.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But then it began to
last for too long.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And when it began to last for
too long, then the Fed reacted.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you see they
began to hike interest rates,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
hike interest rate,

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and initially it didn't
do much to the real rates

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
because expected
inflation kept rising.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:26.873 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
they convinced everyone

00:40:26.873 --> 00:40:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that they were
serious about this,

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and so real interest rates
began to rise a lot here.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the equity
market collapsed, by the way.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that yet, but I'm
going to talk about the equity

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:90%
market later on.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But believe me, that's what
essentially brought down

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:84%
the NASDAQ, for sure, primarily,
and all these memes stocks

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.105 align:middle line:90%
That's that.

00:40:49.105 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
What about today?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, Houston, we have a
problem because, you see,

00:40:57.675 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the Fed keeps raising interest
rates and inflation is not

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.310 align:middle line:84%
coming down as much
as we expected.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, expected
inflation initially

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:84%
looked like it was
going to decline,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and now it's beginning
to pick up again.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
situation here where

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the Fed wants to be restrictive,
but the real interest rate

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
is declining, not going up.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:16.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what is happening
at this very moment.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The Fed has a big
problem because of that.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They are trying to
tighten interest rates,

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:84%
but financial conditions
are relaxing in a sense

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:84%
because of an increase
in expected inflation

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and even credit spreads
were declining, in fact.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So here is what I just
said in terms of inflation,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:90%
expected inflation.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And you see here the big
collapse during COVID,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
early on in COVID, but then
it recovered very strongly

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:90%
and went very high.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in the middle of
2022, it really went up a lot.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
Fed really got scared,

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's when they began to
increase interest rates by 75

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%
basis points in a hurry.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.453 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:41:59.453 --> 00:42:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you see recently.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I told you that we have a
problem now because expected

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:90%
inflation, they were able--

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
there is a famous conference
happens in Jackson Hole,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's famous mostly
because most central chairs

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
of presidents of
central banks, governors

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of central banks around the
world meet for a few days there.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
speech that everyone

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
looks at, which is the speech
of the Chair of the US Central

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Bank, the Fed.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were very worried--
that conference happened around

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.700 align:middle line:84%
here, and they were very worried
because expected inflation

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:90%
was just exploding.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 6% or so, those are
unheard of numbers for the US

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:90%
since the '80s.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up with
a very tough speech,

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:84%
a very hawkish speech, saying,
look, this is unacceptable.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We are going to do whatever it
takes to bring this stuff down.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
successful persuading people.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, expected
inflation began

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to decline a lot
very quickly, which

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is one of the reasons you see
real rates rising very fast,

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
in fact, faster than
the nominal rate,

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because nominal
rates were rising.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, expected
inflation began to plummet,

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and that led to a very sharp
rise in real interest rates

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and the collapse in the
stock market as a result.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
What about credit
spreads in this episode?

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, here you see, during
the COVID shock, again

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.980 align:middle line:90%
we got a big spike here.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:84%
It was not as large as
in the other one, which

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:84%
was a financial crisis per se,
but it was a very large spike.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually of came
down, and it came down a lot.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.680 align:middle line:84%
That's again, when you're seeing
rallying in all the markets

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.810 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But then began to go up.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.415 align:middle line:84%
And again, here, we
began to have a problem

00:43:57.415 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because the Fed
wanted to tighten

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and these credit spreads
were coming down.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I think I did this on
Sunday or something.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Today is 27?

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I did it yesterday.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.750 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So this pickup here
is very recent.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.120 align:middle line:90%
It's last week.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But credit spreads
were declining,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and that, again, goes against
what the Fed wants to do,

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:84%
which is to tighten financial
conditions for firms.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I said before, central
banks typically intervene only--

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.460 align:middle line:90%
the monetary policy.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
involves very short
duration Treasury bonds,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
so their own bonds, the bonds of
that government, in most places

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But this shock was so
disconcerting and so large,

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and it did affect
corporations a lot

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because imagine you're
in the airline industry,

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and then suddenly you get COVID.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So it really was a major
shock to corporations,

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and so they went beyond
traditional conventional

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.457 align:middle line:90%
monetary policy.

00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They certainly-- something that
had done already in the global

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.860 align:middle line:84%
financial crisis, they began to
buy sort of very long-duration

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:84%
US Treasury bonds, so 10-year
bonds and so on, the US

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Treasury.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But they went beyond that
and they created a facility

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.190 align:middle line:90%
to buy corporate bonds.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:25.670 align:middle line:84%
That facility was
meant to deal with x.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You're getting a huge x
shock, and they went directly

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to that to try to bring
that x shock down.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Why do they want to do that?

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of the reasons
we have explained here.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
That amounted the x
shock, which came together

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.050 align:middle line:84%
with expected inflation coming
down, amount to a big shift

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.690 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.760 align:middle line:84%
They did all they could with
conventional monetary policy.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.910 align:middle line:90%
They brought this down.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of their
policy of intervention

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is called-- they're called
large-scale asset purchases.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.420 align:middle line:90%
That's a generic number of that.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they were
trying to do really

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.983 align:middle line:84%
is to act on those
interest rates that

00:46:00.983 --> 00:46:02.025 align:middle line:90%
do not show up in the LM.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:90%
They show up in here, in x.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.690 align:middle line:90%
x is a parameter of here.

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:84%
If I go out there and
I buy corporate bonds,

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.745 align:middle line:84%
then I'm reducing x, which is
a way of shifting the IS back.

00:46:15.745 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Corporations can borrow more
cheaply if the government is

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:90%
buying their bonds.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole idea.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:27.450 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, they even bought
equity, directly equity,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.400 align:middle line:84%
interventions in
the equity market.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So happened in
Hong Kong in 1997.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive intervention
in the equity market.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Typically, central
banks don't do that.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But when situations
get desperate

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and you are against
the zero lower bound,

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.220 align:middle line:84%
so you lost your
conventional monetary tool,

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be a
little more creative,

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
they've been doing.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.260 align:middle line:90%
That's it for today.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:84%
From the-- yeah,
you have a question.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.930 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Could you put x
into more tangible terms?

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.295 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm still sort of
trying to figure out what a--

00:47:05.295 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Credit spread.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:11.650 align:middle line:90%
For example, if Boeing--

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:13.195 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Boeing
is a high yield.

00:47:13.195 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's say Boeing.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
If Boeing borrows, they're not
going to be able to borrow--

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:90%
say, the 10-year rate--

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing it here in
10-year rate spread.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The 10-year rate for the US
at this moment is close to 4%.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:84%
If Boeing wants to
borrow 10 years,

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be
able to borrow at 4%.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.550 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have to borrow at 7%,

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:90%
so there's a 3% difference.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.327 align:middle line:90%
That's x.

00:47:40.327 --> 00:47:41.640 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And that's the
credit-- is that credit?

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.807 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: That's x.

00:47:42.807 --> 00:47:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That's credit spread,
which is linked

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to the perceived probability of
default. I said, it's perceived.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.270 align:middle line:84%
When you say perceived,
is that, say,

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the actual probability
of default?

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.253 align:middle line:90%
Who knows who can measure that?

00:47:55.253 --> 00:47:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They are, again,
agencies that try

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to measure them, plus whatever
extra risk premium you

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.380 align:middle line:90%
want to put on top of that.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.755 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And so
this is tracking

00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:07.522 align:middle line:84%
the relative, this
reliability of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:07.522 --> 00:48:09.230 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Yeah, how unattractive

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:12.380 align:middle line:84%
it looks to lend to a
corporate versus lending

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.682 align:middle line:90%
to the US government.

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And when this line
is very high, it

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.210 align:middle line:84%
looks very unattractive
to lend to corporations,

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.125 align:middle line:84%
and therefore you need to be
compensated a lot for that.

00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:90%
