RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
So today, we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about perhaps
the most important model

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:84%
in this class, the
IS-LM-PC model, which

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
puts together all that
we have done up to now.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that,
let's talk a little bit

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:90%
about current events.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.227 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what that is?

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:37.909 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Is this exam week or what?

AUDIENCE: Silicon Valley Bank.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Silicon Valley Bank, exactly.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So Silicon Valley Bank, the
16th bank in size, asset size,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
in the US went, essentially,
under last Friday.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It was shut down by
the FDIC last Friday.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
decline in the stock

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:90%
value during Thursday, Friday.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
shut down, and you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
see that it's not
been traded anymore.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's a pretty
significant event.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And the weekend was pretty
stressful for anyone

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
involved in this event--

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
the Treasury, the FDIC, the
Federal Reserve, and so on.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's first--
it was a large--

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not one of the big
systemic banks, if you will.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not JP Morgan, Citi, Bank
of America, one of those banks,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
which are regulated even
differently from these banks.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But it still is a pretty large
bank, as you see, by asset size,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.525 align:middle line:84%
$209 billion, which is
comparable to Washington

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Mutual, which was
the largest bank that

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
went under during the
global financial crisis.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Great Recession.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
At that time, there were lots
of other banks that went under.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But the largest was
comparable to this one.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all the things
that were done over the weekend

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and are still
being done today is

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
to prevent something like
this happening here as well.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a pretty
significant event.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened to
Silicon Valley Bank?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the immediate
cost of the failure

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is what always kills a bank,
which is a run on its--

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
by these depositors.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And what you see here
is the following.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this
bank actually grew

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
enormously over the
last two, three years,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.505 align:middle line:84%
essentially doubled
its asset size.

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But it began to have
sort of outflow--

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
net outflows of
deposits during 2022.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
not because the business

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:90%
was doing poorly or anything.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It was simply because this is
a bank that serves primarily

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:90%
sort of the tech sector--

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
startups, companies,
and things like that.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And those sectors were
having a hard time

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
raising new capital
in an environment that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
was not very friendly
towards the tech sector.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So they began to withdraw
on their deposits,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and that's what led
to these flows here.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually, because
of this and something

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain in a
few minutes, they

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
decided, SV Bank decided
to issue new equity,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
issue new equity to
cover certain losses

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:90%
they had incurred.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And today, in the
modern of social--

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in the world of social
media, that immediately

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
led to sort of massive spread
that this bank was in trouble.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you saw enormous
attempts to withdraw deposits.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, not all of
these were fulfilled,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
but there was a massive pressure
to withdraw the deposits.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end,
always, for a bank

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't find an
alternative source of funding.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And often, for
withdrawals of that size,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
the only alternative
source of funding

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is either that some other
bank buys you [CHUCKLES]

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
or that the Fed comes
in and gives you a line.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what is the-- that
was immediate, and it's always--

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
whenever you ask--

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you hear about the bank run, the
immediate cause of the problem

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is a run of the depositors
from deposits in that bank.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did this happen
in this particular bank?

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Again, I explained why.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
You saw those small
withdrawals of deposits.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to
them is actually their--

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
as I said before, their
deposits grew very rapidly

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:90%
over the last two, three years.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, rather than
being very risky lenders,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
rather than
investing-- sometimes

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
when banks grow very rapidly
they do lots of crazy things.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They make lots of loans
without doing the due diligence

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%
process and all that.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they did.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
They bought Treasury bonds, the
safest assets you can imagine.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
They bought 10-year Treasury
bonds, lots of them.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But they bought them
at the wrong time.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They bought them right before
the hike in interest rates

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:90%
that we began to see in 2022.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And we already looked at the
relationship between interest

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
rates and price of bonds.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a 10-year bond,
and the interest rate starts

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
going up, the price of
that bond starts declining.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is not-- is
problematic for a bank,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
but not entirely the
end of the story,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
because that means
that the market

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
value of the bonds you are
holding among your assets

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:90%
starts declining.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But banks do not need to
recognize that loss unless they

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
sell the bonds,
because the logic

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.907 align:middle line:84%
is that, well, if the guy
just sits on the bond,

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the bond hasn't really
lost any value in the sense

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.698 align:middle line:84%
that it will get the
same coupons that it

00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:90%
was planning to get and so on.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.018 align:middle line:84%
This is US treasuries
US treasuries are not

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
going to default on
the coupons let's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
hope it's not going to happen
in a few months from now.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But typically they don't
default on coupons.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So the logic-- the regulation is
designed in such a way-- perhaps

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
that is a failure.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.485 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
a problem there.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But they don't need to
recognize the losses

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:90%
unless they sell the bonds.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So they look pretty healthy
because they had massive amounts

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.780 align:middle line:90%
of Treasury bonds.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need
to recognize that.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Problem is that when these
relatively small withdrawals

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
start, at some
point, they needed

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to find a substitute
for those funds.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
They need to honor the deposits
that were being withdrawn.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they
had to sell assets.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they sold
assets, they made the loss

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
because, at that point, you
have to recognize the loss

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going to
hold the bond until expiration

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and clip all the coupons
that come from it.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
recognize the loss.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the loss that led the
CEO to announce that they needed

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
fundraising to cover up
$2.5-billion hole they had

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
as a result of the losses.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Now-- OK, so now we know
where the losses came from.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you notice, the
losses are not that big.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a bank
with $200 billion,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and the losses were
relatively small.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Where is the other
leg of the problem?

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
In the US, deposits are
insured up to $250,000.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
That means, no matter what
happens to the bank where you

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
have the money, if
that bank goes under,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have deposits
for below $250,000,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
the FDIC comes and
gives you a check.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
So there is no risk.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.162 align:middle line:84%
So you have a deposit
under $250,000,

00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
worry about this.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:84%
You may go-- you don't need to
read the news about this bank,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:90%
because you will get your funds.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when the bank
was shut down on Friday,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the FDIC announced immediately
every deposit under $250,000 can

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
come on Monday and
get this money.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
So there is no issue there.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.337 align:middle line:84%
And most banks have a
large share of depositors

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
that are small depositors.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
That means that they are covered
by this deposit insurance

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.113 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, which was designed
precisely to prevent runs

00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't
need to worry about

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
whether you get your money, you
don't need to run on the bank.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that this
bank was very different

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
in the composition
of depositors.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It had primarily
business deposits,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:84%
meaning it was all these
start up companies and so on

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:90%
in the tech sector.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
They had their deposits there.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And those deposits were
much larger than $250,000.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:90%
If you see, it's about--

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it's close to 95%
of the deposits were not

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
covered by the insurance,
by the FDIC insurance.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
That means it's a very
different calculation when

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
you have a deposit that is
not covered by insurance,

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you start feeling
that the bank may go under.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You take your money
out, put it in some--

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you send it to JPMorgan,
where there is no risk,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and wait until this
thing is resolved.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.113 align:middle line:90%
Now, in this case--

00:09:12.113 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
typically happens.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it happens
even faster than normally.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Because many of the
depositors, the businesses

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that were deposited
in there, were

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
startups that were being seeded
by some venture capital funds.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.733 align:middle line:84%
And venture capital
funds, as soon

00:09:29.733 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
as they noticed that
there was a problem here,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
began to call all the
startups and tell them, hey,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
take that money out of
there because, you know,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] they may
run into trouble.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was a venture
capital world that

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:90%
caused the run, effectively.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened, OK?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.637 align:middle line:90%
Now-- so that's what happened.

00:09:49.637 --> 00:09:50.887 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason for the run.

00:09:50.887 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And so there was a problem.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The problem was not that
big, but the problem

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.943 align:middle line:84%
is that the deposits
were very unsafe.

00:09:59.943 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They were not covered.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And moving deposits
out is very easy.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just [CHUCKLES]
wire your money to another bank.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%
So why wait there?

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Why risk it?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It's called, in economics,
coordination failure.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if everyone
freezes and says,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, nobody takes the
money out and so on,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
this stuff is going to
pass, then we're safe.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.167 align:middle line:84%
But since we don't
call each other,

00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and we don't trust each other
to really leave the money there,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we make the call only after
we have taken our money out.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And since we all
think the same way,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.433 align:middle line:90%
then you get a run on the bank.

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me start
connecting this a little bit

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of things we
have done in this course.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I made-- actually,
this runs later

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.965 align:middle line:84%
in the course as a topic,
crisis, speculative attacks,

00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But for now, here what you
have is an indicator of--

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:90%
essentially, this is the VIX.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It's an indicator of implied
volatility, something

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that's extracted from
the price of options.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know the details.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that it's one
of the main indicators of fear,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
of how afraid are investors
in a moment in the market.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And what you can see here
is that this indicator,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
the VIX, essentially, spiked
Thursday and Friday, went up--

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Friday, went up
very, very rapidly.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it got
stabilized a little.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turned out
that-- it turns out that,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
over the weekend, you may
have heard, the government,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the consolidated government,
came up with a very massive

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.953 align:middle line:84%
package to prevent runs on
the remaining banks and also

00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:90%
to prevent-- the fact that--

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of these
were business deposits

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
of small companies that used
even this bank for the payroll

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So what was done this weekend
is that all the deposits,

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
not only the ones
under $250,000,

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:90%
were guaranteed by the FDIC.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:84%
There are mechanisms in
which you can activate that.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So that means that now all the
depositors were made whole.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.955 align:middle line:90%
But the idea was not-- it was--

00:12:18.955 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
partly, the reason
to do that, it

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
was to prevent a
mess in the payrolls

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
of the small companies
and all that that

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:90%
had their account in this bank.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.035 align:middle line:84%
But it was also to prevent
runs on other banks.

00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And so on top of
this, the Fed now

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
has a line of credit
for banks to not

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:90%
have to sell their assets.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
For small banks, they can
just pledge the assets

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
to the central bank and get
in exchange for that the cash

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:90%
they need.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And they can do that without
recognizing the implicit loss

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
or without marking to market
the price of the bonds.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So had this mechanism existed
before, the plunge of SVB--

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
we would not have seen
anything like that.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But the whole idea was to
prevent that other banks running

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:90%
into that kind of trouble.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the markets reacted well
to all that overnight and so on.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But the VIX kept
going up this morning.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.927 align:middle line:90%
Now it's coming down again.

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's still
a lot of stress.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the shares
of First Republic Bank,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, had declined by
60% today and things like that.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So there is a still
panic going on, OK?

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, all
these indicators of stress

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:90%
are very stressed out.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] Remember
credit spreads.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.127 align:middle line:84%
I told you about that x
that we had several lectures

00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:84%
ago, the probability of default
of a bond, the perceived

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
possibility of default. All
those things went up a lot.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And the riskier the
bonds, the closer you

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
are to the financial system,
particularly to small banks,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
the larger those
spreads have become.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:90%
So x went up a lot.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:84%
This picture that
comes next, I find

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
it very interesting from the
point of view of this course.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
What this is is the following.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the market expectation
of the next hike by the Fed.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The Fed next announcement on
policy rate happens on the 22nd,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:90%
March 22.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So remember what
has been happening

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is that, since the US has
been running sort of very hot,

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
with lots of inflation,
interest rates

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
were increased very
rapidly, at clips

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
of 50 basis points,
a clip that's

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
very large changes in
policy rates for a country

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
as large as the US.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we had this big 25
basis points increases.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And a few meetings
ago, they decided

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to lower the pace of the
increases to 25 basis points,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.045 align:middle line:84%
rather than 50 basis
points per meeting.

00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we're going to
keep raising interest rates.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to go
out to 25 basis points.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out-- so
this is 25 basis points.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
The data has become very hot.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember we said inflation
looked to have peaked

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and now is beginning sort
of to turn around again,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's beginning to rise.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So what has been happening
is that the market says,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, 25% basis points is
the most likely next hike.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the
expectation of that

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is it was sort of steady
around 30 basis points.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Some people expected--
some major players

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
expected the Fed to hike
by 50 basis points, not

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:90%
25 basis points.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
By early last week,
data came very hot.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was indication
that, clearly, inflation

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:90%
was picking up again.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The labor market was
very strong and so on.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So look what
happened to the bets.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, as
expected, value went up.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:90%
This is all traded.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:90%
It went up.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And the expectation was,
for the next meeting,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.453 align:middle line:90%
was north of 40 basis points.

00:15:42.453 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
most of the market

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
thought that the next hike
would be 50 basis points, OK?

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
But look what happened.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the problems
with this bank began.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
And look how this plummeted.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's 15 basis
points expected value.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That means very few people
are expecting 50 basis points.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
thinking 25 still.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But about an equal
size is expecting 0--

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:84%
so a pause in the interest
rate hike by the Fed.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And all that is a result of the
events of the last two or three

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.378 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What is there
to learn from this,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess, in the
bigger structure?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Or who's at fault?

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it the people who
got really scared--

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
all these depositors
that got potentially

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
scared or fear-mongering
that capacity?

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the banks
don't necessarily have--

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.128 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't--

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
feel like it's an unrealistic--

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: There
are many good questions,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
see a lot of that.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.443 align:middle line:84%
And politicians are going
to talk a lot about that

00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:90%
in the next few days and so on.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear that there was
some sort of regulatory failure

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The regulator-- it was
pretty obvious that--

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this bank had doubled
the asset size in a year.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
That's already a red flag.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are
regulated by the Fed.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So the San Francisco
Fed should have

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:90%
been worried about this bank.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:84%
There is issues, conventional
issues of diversification.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's pretty crazy
to have all your savings

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
in one bank, [CHUCKLES]
especially if you're not

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:90%
insured.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.870 align:middle line:84%
There is issues--
there is also--

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:84%
remember, after the
global financial crisis,

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:90%
there was a bill designed to--

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.988 align:middle line:84%
legislation designed
to strengthen

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
the balance sheet of the banks.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
It made them hold
a lot more capital.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
They are subject to--
if they're systemic,

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
they are considered-- they are
subject to stress tests, where

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:84%
regulators go in there and check
whether portfolios can survive

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:90%
major macro shocks and so on.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
Dodd-Frank bill, OK?

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:90%
So that was done.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
In 2018, that got
partially undone,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and partially undone precisely
for this type of banks.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And these guys were
actually lobbying for that.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, why don't you--
because to be sort of really

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
stress-tested and so
on by the regulators,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.448 align:middle line:84%
you have to be big
enough to really

00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:90%
be able to leave a big mess.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what these guys
and banks like them did

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:90%
is they lobby a lot.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So they got the
threshold of assets

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that you need to have in
order to be stress-tested

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:90%
and so on raised dramatically.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So they were right
below the level

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be really
sort of monitored very,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
very closely by the
regulators, by the Fed.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're a systemic bank,
then the Fed regulates you.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
These guys were lightly
regulated by the Fed

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
because they were
below that threshold.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are
regulatory failures.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that the regulator
failed in what it did.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Depositors didn't
diversify enough.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't diversify
enough, the bank itself,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.285 align:middle line:84%
didn't diversify enough
the source of funding.

00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is very
special with this bank--

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's what gives us hope
that this stuff is not going

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:90%
to spread all around--

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is that their funding
was very sort of--

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
was all coming from the
same sector, large saver--

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.105 align:middle line:90%
large depositors and so on.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:84%
A typical bank
doesn't have that.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They have a much broader
source of funding,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
which is what you need
because otherwise--

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
so there are lots of lessons
for bankers, for regulators,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:90%
for macroeconomists as well.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to tell
you the truth, one

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of the concerns with the pace
at which the Fed has been hiking

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:84%
interest rates is that
people were wondering, well,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.795 align:middle line:84%
do we know whether something
will break at some point?

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And there was lots of concern
that something could break.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.253 align:middle line:90%
Well, something broke now.

00:19:34.253 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And this broke entirely--

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the part of the
loss comes entirely

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
from interest rate hikes.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they
got into a portfolio

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of long-- that was very long
rates when rates began to rise.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So they had losses
entirely from that.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's the risk.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
do monetary policy,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is that some people will
be stretched out there.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you sometimes miss
one that is important,

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that's very costly.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the reasons they wanted

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to lower the interest rate hikes
from 50 basis points to 25 basis

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
points because they
knew that something

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:90%
could be fragile out there.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was one
of those things.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:90%
So those are lessons.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was about to
connect with the things we

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
did in a few lectures ago.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, so this is
telling you the markets,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
when they saw this x going
up, it's sort of betting

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Fed will not hike
interest rates as much

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, that
it may even pause.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.855 align:middle line:84%
Rather than raise the
interest rate as was planned,

00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
they may even pause
interest rates.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this, lecture 7.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
In lecture 7, when we talk
about the expanded IS-LM model,

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:90%
we had this x variable.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And we said, look, if x goes
up, that measure of riskiness

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and so on that increases
the cost of borrowing

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
for the private sector,
that is like a shift

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:90%
in the IS to the left.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
For any given safe interest
rate set by the central bank,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
now, all of a sudden, the cost
of borrowing for companies

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
is higher.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
is contractionary.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we went on, remember,
we went on and said, well, here

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
it is, the question, what
should the central bank

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
do in this case in
which x went up?

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Lower interest rates.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: That was
the next slide, in fact, lower

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate
because there's

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
one component of
cost of borrowing

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that's going up for
firms, which is the x.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Fed can offset that
by lowering the interest rate.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, here they're not planning
yet to lower the interest rate.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
They were planning to
raise interest rates,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.938 align:middle line:90%
and now they're slowing down.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the bet.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So the market knows some
basic and expanded IS-LM model

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
explains exactly what you

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.277 align:middle line:84%
should anticipate that's
what is likely to happen.

00:22:09.277 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, that's where
we are at this moment.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.408 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.408 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about this?

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'm going to
move to the lecture, really.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] But I thought
we had to talk about it.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.048 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyways, if he
gets a lot messier--

00:22:26.048 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping that it won't.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.732 align:middle line:84%
But if it gets a
lot messier, then we

00:22:28.732 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
can add a section at the end.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I can replace
something for something

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.733 align:middle line:84%
on banking crisis and
something like that, OK?

00:22:35.733 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is what I teach in
one of my graduate courses.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:90%
So it would be fun.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so now what I want to
do is start this IS-LM-PC model.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the number-- the
name is not very creative.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious what
we're going to do here, no?

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It's going
to combine the IS-LM

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:90%
model with the Phillips curve.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And what this will do for us--

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
it will allow us
to think not only

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
about the impact of
a policy or a shock,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:84%
but also think
about what happens

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:90%
over time with that shock, OK?

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Not to the long run, but
we call this analysis sort

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
of the short run,
which is what happens

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
in the very few
early weeks, months,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and what happens in the medium
run-- say, a year, a year

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:90%
and a half from now.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.435 align:middle line:84%
And so this model will allow
us to put all of this together.

00:23:29.435 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But so you don't
get lost on this,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
so the analysis
of the short run,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.935 align:middle line:84%
essentially, will
remain unchanged.

00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It's our IS-LM model.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just that, give
it a little time,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and you start seeing other
certain effects get undone,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and some others get
exacerbated and so on, OK?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But the short run is still
IS-LM is your basic model.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But then we're going to see
that things happen over time.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So remember the IS-LM
model was essentially

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
this is equilibrium
in the goods market,

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and then we had an LM which
said i equal to i bar.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to replace
the LM already inside this,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%
and I get my IS-LM model.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So for any given i
bar, I could solve out

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:90%
for equilibrium output.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, I'm going to
I'm going to adopt the--

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
do it before, but I

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
think at this point is useful
because it will simplify

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the diagrams when we draw them
to really think of the Fed

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
as setting the
real interest rate.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to assume
now, and then I'm

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
going to explain what happens
when that's a bad assumption.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to assume
for now that, rather than

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
the Fed setting the
nominal interest

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
rate, that the Fed is setting
the real interest rate, OK?

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's setting this.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to talk about problems.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in principle, if
the interest rate is not

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
against the 0 lower bound,
the Fed can always do that.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And say, OK, I'm
going to give them--

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you the
nominal interest rate that,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.835 align:middle line:84%
given this expected inflation,
gives me the real interest

00:25:11.835 --> 00:25:13.167 align:middle line:90%
rate I want, OK?

00:25:13.167 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Fed is really
trying to do all the time.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The Fed is not
trying to figure out

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
what is the equilibrium
nominal interest rate.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It's always trying to figure
out whether the real interest

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:84%
rate is at the right level
or not for the economy.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the tool they have is
a nominal interest rate.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But they are thinking always
about the real interest rate.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:36.365 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there is a problem
because when you are against a 0

00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
lower bound, then you can't
affect the real interest rate

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:90%
But most of the time you can.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm going to think--

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to rewrite
the IS-LM model now.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
call this r bar.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And the bar is there just
to tell you, remind you,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that it's something that
the Fed is setting, OK?

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's our IS-LM.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.312 align:middle line:84%
Remember the
Phillips curve part.

00:25:59.312 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The Phillips-- that was our
Phillips curve, remember?

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the last ones we replaced
the natural rate of unemployment

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
We had an inflation
minus expected inflation

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
was a decreasing function
of the unemployment gap.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So if unemployment was above the
natural rate of unemployment,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
inflation was lower
than expected inflation.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, if the
unemployment rate was lower,

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
then the unemployment rate-- and
the situation of the US today

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
is that everything seems to
point towards a situation

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.463 align:middle line:90%
where u is below u n.

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason we're
seeing sort of high inflation,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm
going to do next is

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go from
unemployment to output.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So I can put-- you see, I don't
have unemployment anywhere here.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I have output.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is
play with the Phillips curve

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
until I write it in the space
of inflation and output,

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
not inflation and
unemployment so I can

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:90%
put the two curves together.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I want to [CHUCKLES]
merge here the IS-LM

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:84%
with the PC, so I want to put
them in the same variable.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we have operated
with a very simple production

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
function in which output
is equal to employment.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what we assume.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Employment, we call it n.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can rewrite
n, employment,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:84%
as the labor force times 1
minus n, employment rate.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:90%
That's employment, OK?

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So I can think of
output as that.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.267 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, I can
define what we call--

00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:90%
we don't call it natural output.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
We call it potential output, no?

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Potential output is
defined as the output

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that you get when
unemployment is

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
at the natural rate
of unemployment, OK?

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's our
definition, three lines.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The potential output is
when the output you get,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
which in this-- with
this production function,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is the employment
you get when you

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:84%
are at the unemployment-- at the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And now we can construct the
difference, this minus that.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
call the output gap.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And you may hear--

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
typically, when people talk
about issues of monetary policy,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:84%
often it's described in
terms of this variable more

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.335 align:middle line:90%
than this gap.

00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
the output gap.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
If the output gap
is positive, that

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
means output is above
the natural rate

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:90%
of the potential output.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.300 align:middle line:84%
When the output gap
is negative, that's

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
output is below
potential output.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So I can rewrite this.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:90%
This minus that is just that.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And now I can
replace u minus u n

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
here for minus Y
minus Yn over L.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I get the Phillips
curve now written

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the output
gap and inflation.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So this says when output is
above potential output, when

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the output gap is
positive, then inflation

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:90%
exceeds expected inflation.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, when output
is below potential output,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
then inflation is below
expected inflation, OK?

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But the logic is exactly the
same as the logic we have here.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is it that this happens?

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, because when output is
above the potential output,

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that means, also,
unemployment is

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
lower than the natural
rate of unemployment, OK?

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's the logic.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Any question about this?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so now we have a
Phillips curve and our IS-LM

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:90%
model.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's put them together.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.553 align:middle line:84%
And suppose for
now-- and I'm going

00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to-- that's the example
I want to carry around

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.153 align:middle line:84%
is that expected inflation
is equal to lagged inflation.

00:29:37.153 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a case in which
expected inflation is not

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:90%
well anchored.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk about what happens when

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:90%
it's anchored and not anchored.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that inflation
is actually-- whatever

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is this year's inflation, that's
what you expect for next year,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So here I have an
example in which here I'm

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
plotting our IS-LM
now, which I'm

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
using remember the real
interest rate here.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:05.235 align:middle line:84%
And in this diagram down here,
I'm plotting the Phillips curve.

00:30:05.235 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first thing, let's look
about this Phillips curve.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Why is it upward sloping?

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Here is output, so this
is a parameter by n.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
left-hand-side variable.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously
increasing in output.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, because if
output grows, that

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:90%
means unemployment goes down.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
That means wages go up, prices
go up, and you get inflation.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the mechanism, OK?

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
example, we have--

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
this is the real interest
rate that the Fed

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.100 align:middle line:90%
has set at this moment.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.702 align:middle line:90%
That's the equilibrium output.

00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
tell you here is

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that nothing has changed in the
way you calculate equilibrium

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:90%
If you just use--

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
for that, you only need this
top diagram in the short run.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I tell you what the real
interest rate is set by the--

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:84%
is, which is a decision by the
Fed, then I know where my IS is.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I can pin down output.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't need this diagram
to really pin down

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium output, OK?

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is different there.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:90%
But-- and this is an example--

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:84%
in this particular case, we have
that inflation is rising here.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And the question is, why?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So for this-- what
I'm trying to say

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is that, for this IS, which is
a function of fiscal policy,

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of how confident consumers
are, and stuff like that,

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
if the Fed chooses this
real interest rate,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:90%
we end up with this output.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
this level of output

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:90%
is increasing inflation.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And the increase in
inflation I can read here.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I see the change in
inflation is positive here.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.477 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:31:48.477 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If you're
changing the output that

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.518 align:middle line:84%
means you have a different
level of employment, which

00:31:52.518 --> 00:31:55.545 align:middle line:84%
changes the expected inflation,
which will raise interest rates.

00:31:55.545 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, here,
I don't need to take--

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
this diagram would
have also worked

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:84%
with expected inflation
as a constant.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm more looking at
what happens to inflation.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, if output is above
the natural rate of output,

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
then inflation is above
expected inflation.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But I can take expected
inflation as a constant.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here it is
a constant because--

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:84%
a constant in the sense
that it's given at time

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:84%
t because it's a previous
year's inflation.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.542 align:middle line:84%
But what is important is
that you have too match

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:90%
aggregate demand.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:84%
This economy is
running very hot.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] If output
gap is positive, then

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that is going to lead to
inflationary pressures.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.965 align:middle line:84%
In this particular model,
where expected inflation

00:32:34.965 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
equal to lagged inflation,
this is pretty bad

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.465 align:middle line:84%
because it's not only
you get inflation

00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
above the target of the Fed, but
inflation is rising over time.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is a case in
which this central bank

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is setting the real
interest rate too low, OK?

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:84%
You may want-- Japan is
doing a little bit of this.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But they have a reason, is that
they have had inflation so low

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that it makes sense for them
to build a little inflation.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:90%
In the US, it made less sense.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.528 align:middle line:84%
The US got into
trouble because it

00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:84%
was in a situation like this
for a long period of time.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reason we have
today 6% inflation-- well,

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
it depends which
indicator you use--

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is because the US
experienced sort of a year

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
with a situation like
this, a year and a half.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what--
sometimes people say

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:90%
the Fed was behind the curve.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.400 align:middle line:90%
They-- for a variety of reasons.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.630 align:middle line:84%
One, initially, potential
output declined because of all

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:90%
the COVID-related issues.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They expected that
to recover quickly.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So they said, let it
go because I'm not

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
going to start moving
my policy rate around

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
for something that will recover
quickly as soon as COVID

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took longer
to recover, and then it

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
came sort of the Russian
war shock and so on.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And so natural rate of
unemployment moved to the left

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:90%
to start.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And second, because of an
enormous policy support,

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
primarily, and the
fact that houses

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
were able to save
a lot during COVID,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot
of pent-up demand.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we had enormous aggregate
demand when we came out of it.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And the real interest
rate that we had

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
was just way too low for
all that aggregate demand

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and that low potential output.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
So we were in a
situation like this.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And inflation began to climb.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.997 align:middle line:84%
Initially, expected inflation
was very well anchored.

00:34:19.997 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we began
to lose that anchor.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Then we recovered, and
now we're losing it again.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
We shall see what happens
after this current episode.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But that was exactly
the situation of the US

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
and of most economies
around the world.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:90%
China is in a different story.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But in most economies
around the world,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
certainly Europe, all of them,
the UK, continental Europe,

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and the UK, Latin America.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of where you look,
the situation was like that.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, real interest
rates were way too low

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:84%
for the natural
rate, the potential--

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
the level of the potential
output we had at that time.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we got into a
situation like this.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's the short run.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.270 align:middle line:84%
In the short run, if you have an
interest rate that is very low--

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, in
the short run, you

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.357 align:middle line:84%
know how to determine output
given a real interest rate.

00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And then now you can
say a little more

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, but
that's going to put

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.327 align:middle line:84%
inflation-- is going to cause
inflationary pressures, up

00:35:12.327 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:84%
or down, depending on
whether you are to the right

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.285 align:middle line:84%
or to the left of the
natural rate of output.

00:35:16.285 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a new twist about
the short run that you know.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But now let's start
moving over time.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:90%
So what happens over time?

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, let me
define something.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.965 align:middle line:84%
With potential output,
we know what it is.

00:35:29.965 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
define something

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:84%
which is called the natural
rate of interest rate.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's called the
neutral interest rate.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.877 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's called the
Wicksellian interest rate.

00:35:38.877 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Let me not get into that story.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
define implicitly

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the natural rate
of interest rate,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.500 align:middle line:84%
or the neutral rate of
interest-- or some people

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:90%
call it r star.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard of r
star in the newspapers.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:90%
People talk about r star.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.268 align:middle line:84%
When they are
talking about r star,

00:35:55.268 --> 00:35:57.050 align:middle line:90%
they're talking about that, OK?

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
It's simply the
interest rate that

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:84%
makes the potential output the
equilibrium of the goods market,

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'm solving implicitly.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I say, I want to
get as a result--

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
as an-- I want to get as a
result of this equilibrium

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:90%
here the natural rate of output.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
What is the interest rate I
need to pick so that's the case?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get the
natural rate of output

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:90%
here, the potential output.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that there is an
interest rate, real interest

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:90%
rate, at which that holds.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of looking for the
interest rate that does that.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
diagram, it's this, you see?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:84%
At this interest rate, the
[INAUDIBLE] equilibrium output

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the natural
rate of output.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I know is that,
eventually, the economy

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:90%
will have to go there.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.201 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.201 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the economy
will have to go there.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So how will this
happen in practice?

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.000 align:middle line:84%
The way it will
happen is, OK, this

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.055 align:middle line:84%
is the point we're at
in the previous slide.

00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:90%
So we're here.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's building
inflationary pressure.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.117 align:middle line:90%
What do you think will happen?

00:37:13.117 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Inflation starts climbing.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Who will react?

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.655 align:middle line:84%
Who's in charge of not letting
inflation get carried away?

00:37:23.655 --> 00:37:26.255 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:28.007 align:middle line:90%
The central bank, the Fed.

00:37:28.007 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So what they start doing
is hiking interest rates,

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what
they have been doing.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And as they hike interest
rate, they're going to keep--

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
they start increasing the
real interest rate until they

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:90%
get to this point, OK?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.686 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that,
in the medium run,

00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the real interest--
real variables

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
determine real variables,
not monetary policy.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.637 align:middle line:84%
Monetary policy has
to follow whatever

00:37:55.637 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
it is that the economy
throws at them.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.277 align:middle line:84%
Central banks have
to follow whatever

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:90%
is the real interest rate.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
If they made a mistake, and they
set a real interest rate which

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:84%
is not consistent with
a stable inflation,

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.030 align:middle line:90%
they're going to learn about it.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And over time, they're
going to have to fix that.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And when will the
problem go away?

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Only when they reach the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what will happen.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:84%
As the real interest rates start
going up, from here to there,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
then you start seeing
the change in inflation

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.485 align:middle line:84%
in this particular model,
a declining and declining.

00:38:29.485 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to a
natural rate of output,

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
at least you get a
stable inflation.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Is this adjustment clear?

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is what
happened in the medium run.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So the medium run is described
as moving from that point here,

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
the whole process of going back
to a situation where we converge

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to a natural rate
of interest rate

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the
natural rate of output

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and the natural
rate of unemployment

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and all these kind of things.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- the short run
is whatever its output is.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:90%
That's your IS-LM.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:84%
The medium run is
whatever the natural rate

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.113 align:middle line:84%
tells you should be the
natural rate of unemployment,

00:39:11.113 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
the natural rate of output,
and therefore the natural rate

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:84%
of interest rate, the
Wicksellian interest

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:84%
rate or the neutral
interest rate, or r star.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That's all pinned down
there in the medium run.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And the transition
is obviously going

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.720 align:middle line:84%
from the short run,
the pure IS-LM,

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to the natural
rate type analysis.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, I assume here--

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's related
to your answer.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I assume here that the expected
inflation was an anchor--

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that is, that expected inflation
was equal to log inflation.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.350 align:middle line:84%
That's-- I told you before
that's not where central banks

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
want to be, because that
means that, if you mess up,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.920 align:middle line:90%
inflation is high.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.147 align:middle line:84%
Then, in order to
bring it down, you also

00:39:57.147 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
have to bring down
expected inflation.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:90%
You need to cause a recession.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.650 align:middle line:90%
And you can see that here.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.077 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the central bank
starts with a level of inflation

00:40:05.077 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:90%
that it likes.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Suppose that this is the model.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I said before,
the expected inflation

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.670 align:middle line:90%
is equal to lagged inflation.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the central bank
starts at the level of inflation

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
that it likes, 2% in the US, OK?

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But suppose that, for whatever
reason, whatever shock,

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:84%
it finds itself with an
interest rate that is too low,

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:90%
a real interest rate is too low.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
That means inflation exceeds
expected inflation, which

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:90%
was 2%.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, by next year, say,
suppose this gap is 2%.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, by next year,
the inflation is 4%.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So if inflation is 4%--

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
in fact, in the US
it's got to be 9%.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're at 9%
level of inflation--

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and this is the model of
expected inflation you have--

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:84%
then, Houston,
you have a problem

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's not enough with
raising interest rates up

00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:90%
to this point.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the Fed says,
well, I don't like 9%.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go back to--

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that clearly tells
me that my output

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is way above the
natural rate of output.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.383 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to hike interest rate.

00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:13.158 align:middle line:84%
And somebody tells the Fed, this
is your natural interest rate.

00:41:13.158 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
A very good research
department tells them, look,

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:84%
this is your natural
interest rate.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Hike it to there.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the Fed hikes the
interest rate to that point.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed realized here
this was going really wrong.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.125 align:middle line:90%
They end up with 9% inflation.

00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But somebody tells them,
look, this is your natural--

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.730 align:middle line:84%
your neutral interest
rate, your r star.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Bring it there.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.478 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed immediately
reacts and takes it there.

00:41:35.478 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Is the Fed happy with
the final outcome?

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And suppose the research
department was really good,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:90%
so they got it right.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So the r star was
the right r star,

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and the Fed implemented
that policy,

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:84%
moving to-- suppose that the
interest rate, the real interest

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.152 align:middle line:90%
rate they had, was minus 1%.

00:41:56.152 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you numbers
that are not that

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:90%
different from what we had--

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:90%
minus 1%.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And the research department
tells them, no, your rn

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:90%
is really 1%.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.665 align:middle line:84%
So they hike interest
rate by 2% immediately.

00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And now what happens?

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that question
is a little vague.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying, is
the central bank happy

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:84%
now that it-- ooh, I got-- we
got the right natural rate,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.900 align:middle line:90%
neutral rate?

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.565 align:middle line:90%
It's called neutral rate.

00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm telling
you, I wouldn't

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
be asking you if the Fed
was happy after that.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think--
why are they unhappy?

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Why is the Fed
unhappy after that?

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Not unhappy with the
policy, but what I'm saying,

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.426 align:middle line:84%
the adjustment is not
completed at that point.

00:42:49.426 --> 00:42:49.926 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:49.926 --> 00:42:56.758 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.758 --> 00:42:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
make the bigger point

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
for why central banks
are so eager to maintain

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.720 align:middle line:84%
credibility and not
have this kind of model

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.650 align:middle line:90%
of expected inflation.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.370 align:middle line:84%
They want the markets to believe
them that they have a target

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and that they want to go
to that target and that,

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to set an expected inflation
equal to that constant

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:84%
equal to the target, that's
what they dream with because,

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
if they don't get that,
if they get this instead,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.260 align:middle line:90%
things are nasty.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
describe that nastiness--

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is happening now.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:90%
So what happens here?

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we went here.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Inflation got to be 9%.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And now the Fed, boom,
hikes interest rate

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.200 align:middle line:90%
by 200 basis points.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:90%
It got to a natural rate.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We're back at output equal
to natural rate of output.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
to inflation here?

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.647 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.647 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So now we're back
at the natural rate.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:90%
What is happening to inflation?

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, this diagram tells
you something very specific.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It says it's not changing.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So now your inflation, at
least, is not changing.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.248 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:44:01.248 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, at least it's not rising.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Here it was rising.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not changing.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
But what is the problem?

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Inflation not changing
when you're at 9%

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is not a good
outcome for the Fed.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.300 align:middle line:90%
The Fed wants 2%, not 9%.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So they-- when you
have this modification,

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
you need to do more than that
because you need to bring

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.990 align:middle line:90%
expected inflation down.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So you need to overshoot.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
A Fed that finds itself
with 9% inflation

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and has expected
inflation an anchor

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.763 align:middle line:84%
needs to be
inflation much lower.

00:44:32.763 --> 00:44:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to raise interest
in the short run much higher

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.805 align:middle line:84%
than the natural rate
of interest rate.

00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So it gets negative
inflation here

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:84%
so you can bring
the 9% back to 2%.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So I have to generate
the minus 7% here.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And to generate
the minus 7% here,

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I need to bring output
much below the natural rate

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.250 align:middle line:90%
of output.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I need to cause a big
recession to do that.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
the central banks don't

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.290 align:middle line:84%
want to be in this
scenario, because

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:03.550 align:middle line:84%
with this level of inflation,
if expected inflation becomes

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:84%
an anchor, then there
is no way around that.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.143 align:middle line:84%
The Fed will have to cause
a big recession to get out

00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:09.310 align:middle line:90%
of the inflationary problem.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Contrast that with
a case in which

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the market-- the
expected inflation

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is not equal to lagged
inflation but is

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
equal to whatever the Fed
tells them is the long run

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:90%
average, 2%.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, suppose that,
therefore, rather

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:84%
than having here pi minus 1, I
have that target, pi bar, which

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.390 align:middle line:90%
is 2%.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, we got to 9%.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:90%
But for the Fed to go back to--

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the Fed would say,
oop, I messed up.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, I set a real interest
rate that was way too low,

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and so I end up
with 9% inflation.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But if credibility
is maintained,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and still people expect
2% in the medium run,

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.490 align:middle line:84%
then that means
that the Fed doesn't

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:84%
need to cause a recession
to bring inflation back

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:90%
to the normal level.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It just needs to bring
output to a level

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:90%
equal to potential output.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So it just needs to
raise interest rate

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to rn, to the natural
rate of the r star,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:84%
not to r star plus
something in order

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to have disinflation
in the short run, OK?

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.392 align:middle line:84%
And we're there at this
moment, on the verge

00:46:13.392 --> 00:46:14.225 align:middle line:90%
of these two worlds.

00:46:14.225 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We have been alternating
between the two worlds,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:84%
still more biased
towards the good world

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
in which the Fed doesn't
need to cause a-- they need--

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.670 align:middle line:84%
the Fed needs to
slow down the economy

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:84%
because it still needs to
bring output down to Yn.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:90%
But that's a small change.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.240 align:middle line:84%
In practice, all these
things are growing over time.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It just means that the
economy grows at a lower

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.870 align:middle line:90%
pace for a few quarters, OK?

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's very different to have
to bring temporary output down

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.960 align:middle line:84%
here because, for that, you
need to sort of bring the--

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.560 align:middle line:84%
growth has to become negative
for some period of time

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
inflation down.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.400 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So big lessons
from this part are

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that, as I said before,
in the medium run--

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.943 align:middle line:90%
so I haven't changed--

00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I haven't changed any
of the two models.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.027 align:middle line:84%
I told you what was the model
of the short run, the IS-LM.

00:47:09.027 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:90%
That's still true here.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I told you then what was the
model of the natural rate

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.007 align:middle line:84%
of unemployment and all
that and that there we

00:47:15.007 --> 00:47:17.257 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any monetary
policy or anything like that.

00:47:17.257 --> 00:47:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We look at what happened
in the labor market,

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and we determine the natural
rate of unemployment.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And that was it, OK?

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.072 align:middle line:84%
So the medium run
here is when we

00:47:27.072 --> 00:47:28.780 align:middle line:84%
are in that world in
which it has nothing

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:90%
to do with monetary policy.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It has all to do with
real variables, OK?

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
What is an equilibrium,
long-run real interest rate,

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:84%
what is a natural
rate of unemployment,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But monetary policy,
what it does do

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is certainly determine, in the
short run, equilibrium output.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.438 align:middle line:84%
But in the medium
run, it determines

00:47:52.438 --> 00:47:54.980 align:middle line:84%
what is a nominal interest rate,
equilibrium nominal interest

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.860 align:middle line:84%
rate, and the level of inflation
because the economy will

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have a real interest rate,
which is the r star and rn.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.760 align:middle line:90%
The economy has rn.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But the Fed-- and the Fed will
not get to pick what rn is.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that the Fed will
get to pick in the medium run

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:14.090 align:middle line:84%
is what is a nominal
interest rate that

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with that rn,
because suppose that the rn is,

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.260 align:middle line:90%
say, 2%.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
If the economy ends up having
3% inflation on average,

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that means that the nominal
interest rate for the long run

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:90%
is going to have to be 5%.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:84%
If instead, that economy
has 2% inflation average,

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
then that means that the
long-run nominal interest

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.010 align:middle line:90%
rate will be 4%.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy affects
the nominal interest rate,

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:84%
nominal variables in the medium
run, but not the real variables.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.830 align:middle line:84%
The real variables are
determined by the real sector.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's often referred
as the neutrality of money.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:84%
In the medium run and the long
run, money tends to be neutral.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.132 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it means,
is that real variables

00:48:56.132 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
are determined by something
entirely different.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the short run, monetary
policy is the main game in town.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the medium run,
it's just about inflation.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not about real activity.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me stop here.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:27.000 align:middle line:90%
