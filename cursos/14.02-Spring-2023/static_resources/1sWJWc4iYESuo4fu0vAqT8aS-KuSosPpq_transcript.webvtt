[SQUEAKING]
[RUSTLING] [CLICKING]

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: All
right, let's start.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So today I want to talk
about interest rates.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have followed
the news, there

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of debate on
these days on where

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
will the interest
rate in the US end

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
at the end of this
tightening cycle.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And so I'll show you.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
There has been a very
aggressive monetary policy

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to fight the inflationary
episode we're going through.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's done
through interest rates.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
I want to address today

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is well, how is it that the
interest rate is determined?

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So when a central bank decides
to hike interest rates,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
how do they do that?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And obviously this is
about financial markets.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Interest rates are set
in financial markets.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And financial markets are
very, very complicated.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to keep
it very, very simple.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to introduce
more complexity

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
later on in the course.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.608 align:middle line:84%
But still, we're going
to keep it pretty simple

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
because our main objective
in studying financial markets

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
is really to achieve some
sort of understanding of how

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate policy that
the central bank controls

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%
is determined.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So before I get into specifics,
let's see some trivia here.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Who knows who that person is?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.144 align:middle line:90%
You, sir.

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Jerome Powell.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Jerome Powell, exactly.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.676 align:middle line:90%
And who is Jerome Powell?

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The chair of
the Federal Reserve.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: The
chair of the Federal Reserve

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
System in the US, which is
the central bank of the US.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that was an easy one.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you are into
financial markets,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
everyone is worried about
what this guy is thinking

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and his friends are
thinking at this moment

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.317 align:middle line:84%
because they determine
the interest rate.

00:02:25.317 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we're
going to talk about later on.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%
A little trickier.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.835 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.455 align:middle line:90%
That's cheating.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Katsuo Ueda.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
He's the next president
of the Bank of Japan,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:90%
the central bank of Japan.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting-- there are
many interesting things of him,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
about him-- but he's a he's
a graduate from our program,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the PhD program,
which actually is

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
an incredibly successful
program at producing

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:90%
major central bankers.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Ben Bernanke is our alumnus.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
He was the chairman
of the central bank,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the chair of the
central bank of the Fed

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
during the financial crisis.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Mario Draghi is one
of our graduates.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Mario Draghi was the most
successful central banker

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
He was the president of the
ECB, European Central Bank,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
for many years,
and in particular,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.458 align:middle line:84%
during the global financial
crisis and the European crisis,

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
which followed the
global financial crisis.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
But you name it--

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Stan Fisher in the past
of the Bank of Israel.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, Phil Lowe of
the chair of the Reserve

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Bank of Australia.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In Chile we have had two or
three presidents and so on.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So if this is your career,
this is a good program.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:90%
You should join our program.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:90%
You may end up in a good place.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
next one for Japan.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And Japan is a very
interesting place

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view
of monetary policy,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
precisely because they
haven't had much space to do

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
conventional monetary policy.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So they have had to do lots
of unconventional things

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view of what
a central bank typically does.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But today, we're going to
study conventional things.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk a little bit
more about unconventional things

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
later in the course.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, some institutional
knowledge--

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
this is, again, in the US,
the central bank of the US

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
is called the Federal
Reserve System.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a system, really.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
It has the Board of Governors
which sits in Washington DC.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And there are seven governors.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And the governors are
nominated by the president

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and then confirmed
by the Senate.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And the president
of that board is--

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
so the president of the Fed
will be one of those members.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to that, the
US has a Federal Reserve bank

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:90%
There are 12 regional banks.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:90%
There is one in Boston.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look at the
skyline near the waterfront,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
there is a building built
out of recycled aluminum.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
Reserve Bank of Boston.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And of those 12 regional
banks, they rotate.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So the policy, the
policy interest rate,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is set in a committee, which is
called the FOMC, Federal Open

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Market Committee.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And the member of that, the
voting members of that committee

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
are the seven governors
plus 4 out of the 12.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And they rotate.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Most of them rotate.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The only one I think
does not rotate

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is the president of
the New York Fed,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
important, because that's

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the financial heart of
the US that you certainly

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
want that president to be
involved in interest rate

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:90%
decisions.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the Fed that
is in charge of communication

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:84%
with financial markets, which
is a huge thing for the Fed.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
They are in New York and
they're crucial for that.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
OK so those are
the people that--

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and in most places
around the world

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have at least
something equivalent to the 7

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
governors out there--

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:90%
most places.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the ECB is different
because it's multiple countries.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.465 align:middle line:84%
So each country
sends one member.

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, it
tends to be like the US

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:90%
without the regional banks.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So why do we care
about monetary policy?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the thing
is one of the main policy

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:84%
tools you have in the
short run remember

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.105 align:middle line:84%
in this part of
the course, we're

00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
output in the short term.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
policy levers--

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can
you affect output--

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:90%
is monetary policy.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Which one is the other one?

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.095 align:middle line:90%
There are two major ones.

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Fiscal policy.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Fiscal policy.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.235 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And fiscal policy we did look
at in the previous lecture.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we said an
expansionary fiscal policy

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing G
while a decline in T

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
would lead to an expansion
in aggregate demand.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Equilibrium output would go up.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So fiscal policy is
something you always

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
use in deep recessions.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But monetary policy
is much more nimble.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
bunch of people that

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
need to meet and just
change the interest rate.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is fiscal, there
are some automatic stabilizers,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So automatically,
fiscal policy becomes

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
more expansionary during
recessions and stuff like that.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But any deviation from the
typical automatic stabilizers

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
require Congress
to approve things.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a long process.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not something
that can react as

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.428 align:middle line:90%
quickly as monetary policy can.

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're going to do.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why monetary
policy is important for us

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Then there are medium
and long run issues.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal policy still
affects equilibrium output

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:90%
in the medium and long run.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Monetary policy is much
less effective at that.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to change
sort of equilibrium growth

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:84%
or things like that
with monetary policy.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very pretty minor.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the impact of monetary
policy in the medium and long

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
run is really on the
price level and inflation

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:90%
more than on real activity.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But in the short run it's
very powerful for reasons

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to discuss
in this and the next lecture.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as I said,
monetary policy

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:90%
acts through financial markets.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very interesting
part of my research agenda

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:90%
is about that.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the central bank is
a very strange institution

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
because most of its mandates
are in terms of what

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:90%
happens in the goods market.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
It says try not to
get into recession.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Try to get us out of a
recession, and so on.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But unlike fiscal policy, which
has tools that are directly

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
aimed at the goods
market, remember,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.043 align:middle line:84%
is a purchases by the
government of goods.

00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So if there is
insufficient demand

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
for goods, the fiscal
policy, the fiscal authority

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
can go out there and buy goods.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:90%
That creates more demand.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The central bank is given
the same mandate aside

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
from price stability
and things like that we

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:90%
want to worry about later.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't have any tools.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The central bank, if there
is insufficient demand,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:84%
the central bank cannot go
out there and buy hamburgers.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal policy can do that
and expand the demand

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
for hamburgers, but
not monetary policy.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What monetary policy can do
is buy bonds, buy instruments

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:90%
in the financial markets.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
affects real activity.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's the fastest policy tool
but it's the most indirect,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, because it has to
go through financial markets.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And those channels
can be very complex.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, we're not in the
business of complicating things

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:90%
in this course.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to make
it very, very simple.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to assume that
financial markets only

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
have two instruments.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Obviously a huge simplification.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of financial
instruments out there.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to isolate only
two instruments because this

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the instrument
where the central banks

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:90%
typically participate.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They affect all
asset prices around.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.647 align:middle line:84%
But the direct
interventions typically--

00:10:35.647 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:84%
recently has been a
little different--

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.862 align:middle line:84%
but typically it's only in
these kind of instruments.

00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
focus all of our analysis

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.633 align:middle line:84%
on those two
instruments for now.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Later on, we're going to
talk about equity and stuff

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But just to isolate how
monetary policy works,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
it's sufficient to just focus
on two financial instruments.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
assume that people

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
have their wealth in only two
forms, in two financial assets.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
One, we're going
to call it money.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the other one we
want to call it bonds.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Money, the characteristic of
money, what we call money,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
there are many definitions of
money, and 1, and 2, and 3,

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and 4.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:90%
But let's keep it very simple.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Money essentially
means something

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that you can use very
easily for transactions.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:31.895 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the most
important example of money--

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
not the largest, but
the most important one--

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:90%
is cash, currency.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:90%
You can buy anything with cash.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem whatsoever.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Now the characteristics of the
money typically does not have,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't give you any return.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:90%
You don't invest in cash.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You have cash because you
need to do transactions.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the way
you get a return.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And so money, that's what
it's going to mean for us,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
used in transactions.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But it pays no interest
rate, no interest.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no interest on that.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
A bond is going to be
the polar opposite.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be something that
pays a positive interest rate.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy a bond
for 100, for 95,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
$100 a year from now.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So you get something
out of that bond.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's not very
useful for transactions.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you cannot go and
buy your lunch with a bond.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You get the piece
of bond for that.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And many things cannot be--

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:90%
even within financial markets--

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
you cannot buy
assets with asset.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through some
process in which you can sell

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
something, get cash,
and with cash you

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
pay for that stuff--
not necessarily cash.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
It could be other
forms of money.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But typically,
financial instruments

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
need to be sold before you
can buy something else.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't swap them.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not a barter.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
it means for us.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So this, whenever you
see something like this,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
is always interesting
for an economist.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Any economists,
microeconomists or whatever.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
there that makes--

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Economics is about decisions.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it's about
the equilibrium--

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.195 align:middle line:90%
decisions and equilibrium.

00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What makes people
decide how much [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: There's
a decision to be made here.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:90%
There's a trade off.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
If I need to do lots
of transactions,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I better bias my portfolio
towards cash, towards money.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
If I don't need to do
lots of transaction

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and the interest
rate is very high,

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
particularly, then
this is an issue today.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Today interest
rates are very high.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Nobody cares about bonds
or anything two years ago

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
when the interest rate was 0.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:90%
But today interest rate is 5%.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.477 align:middle line:90%
So it's an issue.

00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
If you want to keep
it in cash, you're

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
going to give up
a lot of return.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.987 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
decision to be made.

00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a portfolio decision.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
interesting for economists.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that decision.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to talk--

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.077 align:middle line:84%
you can describe this decision
either from the side of bonds

00:14:10.077 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:90%
or from the side of money.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.118 align:middle line:84%
We're going to describe
from the side of money.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a total
amount of wealth and you

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
have to decide what
to allocate it to.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It suffices, if I tell you
there's a total amount of wealth

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.483 align:middle line:84%
and if I tell you how much
you allocate to money,

00:14:25.483 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
then I'm telling you
implicitly how much

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:90%
you are allocating to bonds.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a complement of that.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.108 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot do an
analysis either way.

00:14:32.108 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to do it
through money, which

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:90%
is the way it's normally done.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So money demand, if I plot
it in the space of m, money,

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and the interest rate, it's
a downward sloping curve.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Why is it a downward
sloping curve?

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The interest
rate is higher.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.655 align:middle line:84%
It pays off more to get
bonds, your utility shifted.

00:14:56.655 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Your decision, if the
interest rate is very high,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
is to go more towards bond.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
The interest is very low, I
don't care too much about bonds.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather keep the thing
that helps me transact,

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:90%
which is money.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
for most of your adult life,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
you have lived in a world
in which that was not a very

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%
interesting decision, actually.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.805 align:middle line:84%
Because interest rates
were very close to zero.

00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Now you're living in a
different environment.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Interest, for the first
time, sort of high for you.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
For you, there may be a bigger
decision between investing

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in equities and cash.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But bonds-- and
these are safe bonds,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
by the way, US treasuries
and things like that.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And money is not something
you have to worry about.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.855 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is interest
rates were around here.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So you were all in cash
one way or the other.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And now interest rates
are a lot higher.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that-- so that's
a movement along the curve.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm plotting something in the
space of interest rate, money

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and interest rate.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Then when I tell you what
happens when the interest

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
rate rises, I'm asking you for
a movement along the curve.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I raise interest rate,
I move along the curve up.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.413 align:middle line:84%
So the second thing that we
have there, argument we have

00:16:13.413 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is something that shifts
the curve, because it's not

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
part of my axis.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:90%
So it will shift the curve.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a parameter for
each of these curves.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's nominal income.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, if
nominal income goes up,

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.175 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you there,
that money demand goes out.

00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Meaning for any given
level of interest rate,

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
demand more money.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's the case?

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm looking
here at the aggregate.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But it applies to an
individual, as well.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So for the same level of wealth,
now nominal GDP is higher.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember that nominal GDP is
the same as nominal expenditure

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.872 align:middle line:84%
So if nominal GDP
is higher, then that

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
means there's going to be more
transactions because there's

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:90%
going to be more expenditure.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you need
more of the thing that

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
is useful for transactions.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Money demand goes up.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
The second point to highlight
is that while, in most places,

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
we use Y, here I'm using
dollar y, nominal y.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think is that?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I just put there real
GDP rather than nominal GDP?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it a typo?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into steps.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that prices are totally
fixed and real GDP goes up.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
That means that this economy
needs more transactions

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
be more expenditure.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So that explains that yeah,
when real output goes up,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:90%
then money demand goes up.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When I say money
demand goes up, I

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
said for any given interest
rate we have more money demand.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.242 align:middle line:90%
Now fix real output.

00:18:04.242 --> 00:18:06.575 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, suppose that
the price of goods doubles.

00:18:06.575 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you need
more money to transact?

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because
it's the same.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
It's equivalent.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Money is dollars.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I have $10.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And now prices are twice
what they used to be.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to need
more dollars to transact.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason we
have nominal GDP here

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.795 align:middle line:90%
rather than real GDP.

00:18:28.795 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's now determine
the interest rate.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm to do it in the
simplest possible model first.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And by simplest, I mean here
in particular, no banks.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:90%
No intermediaries.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.812 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's only a
central bank and people.

00:18:46.812 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so suppose that
the central bank

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:84%
decides that it wants to-- this
is the way monetary policy used

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:90%
to be conducted.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the size that
it wants to offer

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:90%
m dollars to the economy.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And the central bank is
the one that produces at--

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
this moment in which I
have no intermediaries,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:90%
money is really currency.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The only one that can produce
currency-- forget Bitcoin--

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
only one that can produce
currency is the central bank.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean dollars.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:90%
No one else can produce dollars.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Watch out when we talk
about banks later on.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.307 align:middle line:84%
In this economy I'm
describing, there are no banks.

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The only one that
can produce dollars,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:90%
currency, is the central bank.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Any other one that produces
dollars, that's illegal.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's a central bank.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So the central bank can decide
how much money to supply.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And suppose it
decides to supply m.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is now?

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
For the first time I can
answer the question is, well,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
what is the interest
rate in this environment?

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know that?

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I have a money supply.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I have a money demand.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.062 align:middle line:84%
The intersection at this level
of money supply, the equilibrium

00:20:09.062 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
interest rate, that
is the interest

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:84%
rate is consistent with money
demand equal to money supply,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:90%
is that one.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it clear?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:90%
So I have my money demand.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying the central bank,
suppose the central bank decides

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to supply m.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, in equilibrium, that
will be the interest rate.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the interest
rate is determined.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose that the
central bank increases.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the goal
of this lecture

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is that we get to understand how
is it that the interest rate is

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:90%
determined.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
How is it that the
Fed, the central bank,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
determines the interest rate?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Here, we said, look,
the central bank

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
decides on certain
amount of money.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the market determines
what the interest rate is.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way monetary
policy used to be conducted.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
The central banks
would typically

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
decide the amount of
money in the system.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It was called
monetary aggregates.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The amount of money in the
system and then the market

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
would determine
the interest rate.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It turned out that
was a nightmare.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And so now that's not
what central banks do.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was a nightmare
because this money demand that

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
looked so peaceful
here, in practice

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
is moving around all the time
for a variety of reasons.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Even holidays affect the
money demand and all that.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you fix the
monetary aggregates,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.875 align:middle line:84%
and money is moving all over
the place, what happens?

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:45.113 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.113 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the
central bank says

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.193 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to offer this
amount of m, that's it.

00:21:49.193 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And now I tell you the money
is moving all over the place.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
There are weeks that have
three days of weekend that

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
have no vacations in between,
or there is a Super Bowl

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and lots of people decide to buy
tickets or whatever, or beer, so

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.922 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:22:05.922 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.017 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Well, no.

00:22:08.017 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Because when you say shortage--

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.785 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it depends what
you mean by shortage.

00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So you could be right with
that part of the answer.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you say excess
demand, then I have a problem.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that's true only if
the interest rate doesn't move.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But in a situation in which
a central bank fix em.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And let the market do its thing,
then the interest rate will not

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:90%
be fixed.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the
problem, that the interest rate

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:90%
becomes very, very volatile.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
If you do it only through
monetary aggregates

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
because this guy is
moving all over the place.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.293 align:middle line:90%
And so imagine what happens.

00:22:47.293 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
If this demand shift up, then
an equilibrium interest rate

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
goes up, precisely to
avoid your excess demand.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.413 align:middle line:84%
Because if this thing goes
up, I have an excess demand

00:22:56.413 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:90%
at that interest rate.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.788 align:middle line:84%
But what will happen
in equilibrium

00:22:58.788 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is the interest rate will go
up until the excess demand

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:90%
disappears.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Now in central banks like
the US, central bank the Fed,

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
they can control this
stuff fairly well.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Many of the central
banks don't have that.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the Bank of China,

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.427 align:middle line:84%
for example, they have lots
of high frequency movements

00:23:19.427 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
in interest rates
because they are not

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:90%
very good at doing this stuff.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not that easy to control
an interest rate, for example,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%
to keep it fixed.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.602 align:middle line:84%
But the central bank
used to do that.

00:23:31.602 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:90%
It used to do that.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying in
practice this system

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
wasn't very good because
in practice, the money

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is moving around for a lot
of idiosyncratic reasons.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are using credit.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
very predictable.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of panic around
the shift of the year 2000

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that the ATMs would stop
working and stuff like that.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So there was a massive
increase in money demand

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
because people wanted to have
cash just in case ATMs stopped

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and so there are some things
that are predictable and some.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But you can get very
large fluctuations.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So in practice, what central
banks do nowadays is really

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
is they tell you what
the interest rate is.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they offer
whatever m the market needs

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:90%
for that interest rate.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the way modern
monetary policy works.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll tell you a little
bit more about that.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.678 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what
happens here if--

00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
suppose the Fed, for reasons
that you will understand better

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in the next lecture,
suppose the Fed

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
decides that they want to have
an expansionary monetary policy.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Expansionary monetary policy
means it's going to expand m.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It was offering a
certain amount of m.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And now it decides to
offer more of that m.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:90%
So what happens in equilibrium?

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, we start from
an equilibrium here.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
If the interest rate
remains at that level,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
now we have an excess
supply of money.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
restore that equilibrium

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.690 align:middle line:84%
is by people
demanding more money.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And when will people
demand more money?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the
interest rate is lower.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So excess demand, the
interest rates are declining.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Then the demand for money starts
catching up with the new hire

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
supply of money.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with a
lower interest rate.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's an expansionary
monetary policy,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
an increase in m that leads to
a decline in the interest rate.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, modern central
banks don't tell you

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
increase m by 20%.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
What they tell
you is we're going

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to cut interest rate by,
say, 50 basis points.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
When they tell you
that they're going

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to cut interest by
50 basis points,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:90%
they're reading you this axis.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But behind that operation
there must have been

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:90%
an increase in money supply.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
all the fine tuning

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that they have to do now so
the interest remains there

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
when the money is vibrating
around that thing there.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But when we say an
expansionary monetary policy,

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
we really mean cutting
interest rates.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
How is that the interest
rate is cut effectively?

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.438 align:middle line:84%
By an increase in
the money supply.

00:26:15.438 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But they don't tell you
that they are doing that.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they're doing.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, we're in
the opposite process.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:90%
We're moving that way, up.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But you seen, in
every single meeting

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
now for the last
seven meetings or so,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
we have seen a hike
in interest rates.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.695 align:middle line:90%
Well, they don't tell you that.

00:26:41.695 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying, we're
going to cut money supply

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.406 align:middle line:90%
and moving in that direction.

00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:48.515 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.515 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if they move
in that direction,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:90%
then interest rate go up.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:90%
What else shifts?

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
kind of shift.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that nominal
income goes up.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
all the time.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Nominal income is growing in
most economies most of the time.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're in a recession,
nominal income is growing.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
It's growing for two reasons--

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.083 align:middle line:90%
one, because you have inflation.

00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is because
of real output is growing.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
That means that typically
in an average year,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
money demand is
shifting to the right.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So if money demand shift to
the right and money supply

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
does not change, then what
happens to the interest rate?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Money demand goes up, money
supplies doesn't change.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
the interest rate?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Increases because at
this interest rate

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:84%
here, we have an excess
demand for money.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have to reduce
the money demand.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
How do we reduce money demand?

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:90%
By increasing the interest rate.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we get there.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's yet another reason
why it's not a good idea

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to be targeting
monetary aggregates.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The Fed tells you we want
the interest rate at 5%, say.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.015 align:middle line:84%
And then the economy will
be growing and so on.

00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And what the Fed
will be doing is

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.700 align:middle line:84%
if they want to maintain
the interest rate at 5%,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
well, they keep expanding m so
the interest rate doesn't go up.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it's
normally conducted.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But if the Fed stays
sleepy and they have

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%
an increase in money demand.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Then the interest rate
will tend to go up.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So I told you that the central
bank is moving m, increasing

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:90%
m, reducing m, or whatever.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:90%
So how do they do that.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not that they--

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:84%
although that policy
has been advocated.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they go in a
helicopter and sort of fly

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:90%
builds on top of all of us.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Although, again, it has been
advocated in extreme cases

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:90%
of recessions, and so on.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
helicopter money.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Just give money away.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the way
it's normally done.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:84%
For normal operations,
is not done that way.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.965 align:middle line:90%
So how is it done?

00:29:16.965 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we have
a financial system that

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:90%
is very simple for now.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We have money and bonds.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.713 align:middle line:84%
So what the central bank
does, the central bank

00:29:25.713 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
wants to change the
portfolio of people.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
They want people to have less
bonds, say, and more money.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:84%
That's to raise
the interest rate.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So what the central
bank does is goes out

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
there and expansionary
open market operation.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Open market is because they
go into the open market

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to buy bonds, the as opposed to
an operation that happens behind

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:90%
doors.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If the Fed went directly to
the Treasury and bought bonds,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that would not be an
open market operation.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is they
go to the financial system

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and they go with a big
bag of money and say,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, we want bonds.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the public sells bonds
to them in exchange for money.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:90%
That's an expansionary market.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So what we saw before when
m shift to the right, what

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.330 align:middle line:84%
the central bank really did is
went out there and bought bonds

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:90%
from the public.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
The public sold the bonds and
got the cash at some price.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
When I show you equilibrium
in the money market,

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that means also an equilibrium
in the bond market necessarily.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be the price
is right for the portfolio

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:90%
of individuals.

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
A contractionary open market
operation is the opposite.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a central bank goes
out there and sells bonds

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
to the market and
takes the cash back.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
That's a contractionary
monetary policy.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:90%
So when the Fed wants to--

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me finish.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
When the Fed wants to
cut interest rates, what

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the Fed does is an
expansionary monetary policy,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:84%
which means it goes out there
and buys bonds from the market

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and gives cash to the market.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.475 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:31:02.475 --> 00:31:04.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How can a central
bank, in this instance,

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
guarantee that someone's
going to buy their bonds?

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
If their government didn't
have the financial stability,

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the United
States has, how

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.878 align:middle line:84%
would they guarantee
that these bonds will be

00:31:15.878 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:90%
worth anything in the long run?

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Well, I mean, you're

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:90%
talking about risk premium.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's an additional issue.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Typically central banks
intervene in very short duration

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.250 align:middle line:90%
bonds.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the typical bond
that is risky in many sense.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very, very short
duration bonds, treasuries,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%
very short duration.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's even less.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays central
banks really intervene

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.500 align:middle line:90%
in the overnight market.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But you're that countries
that don't have a bond

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:84%
market, a well-developed
bond market,

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.697 align:middle line:84%
have problems with the
management of monetary policy

00:31:55.697 --> 00:31:57.697 align:middle line:84%
and so on because they
have a credit spread that

00:31:57.697 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:90%
is moving around, as well.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to focus on
the type of instruments.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
That thing becomes
very important.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for Japan, even big
guys, very big guys, now

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
they have an issue because
they have been buying bonds,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:90%
very long duration bonds--

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:84%
so 10 year bonds
and stuff like that.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.683 align:middle line:84%
And there it's a
little trickier.

00:32:16.683 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Market needs to trust
you a lot more if you're

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.360 align:middle line:84%
dealing with 10 years things and
you're dealing with three month

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:90%
horizons and so on.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:84%
In other instances,
for example, Chile

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
has a situation like
that, the central bank

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:90%
itself can issue bonds.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so those are bonds
issued by central banks.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to be
very reliable bonds

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.897 align:middle line:84%
because these are bonds that
are issuing your same currency.

00:32:42.897 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So you have the currency
to always pay them.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You can always print money
and pay for those bonds.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So it rarely happens
that there is

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.135 align:middle line:90%
default on bonds of that kind.

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The typical bonds,
government bond,

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that defaults is a
bond that is issuing

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
a currency different
from the one you have

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:84%
because then you may
not have the currency

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:90%
to pay for the stuff.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason emerging
markets run into trouble

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the balance
sheet of the central bank,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
how does an open
market operation look?

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the balance sheet,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
this is an incredibly simplified
version of the balance

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:90%
sheet of the Fed.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:84%
They have lots of things,
more assets, gold,

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of stuff.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But in our simple economy,
the government, the Fed,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the assets of the Fed,
they have some bonds.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It has already some
bonds out there.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And the liabilities is
the money they issue.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:90%
They owe that to people.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they issue currency.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's a liability.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
People can do things with and
buy things with that money

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a liability.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way the
balance sheet looks.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the Fed decides to do
an expansionary open market

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:84%
operation, then what it
does is it goes out there.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.703 align:middle line:84%
It issues, say, a $1
million expansionary

00:34:05.703 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:90%
open market operation.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:84%
They do it in much
bigger tickets on this.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:90%
But let's make it simple.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:84%
$1 million of an
expansionary operation.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.159 align:middle line:84%
When they go there,
they print $1 million

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and they buy $1 million
from the market.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end, the balance
sheet ends like it used to be.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
There is an extra $1
million of liabilities

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:84%
because now there's
a million more

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of dollars
circulating out there.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But against that, the central
bank also has a million more

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.200 align:middle line:90%
of bonds holdings.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happens.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:84%
With an expansionary
monetary policy,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
the balance sheet of the
central bank expands.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
Both sides expand by the
same amount, but expands.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
themes of recent years,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
global financial crisis,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is that these
balance sheets used

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to be small peanuts type
things, for $1 trillion

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:84%
or something like that for
something like the US, the size.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays they're much,
much larger than that

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.507 align:middle line:84%
because they have done so many
operations to first get us out

00:35:15.507 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of the global financial crisis
and then to get us out of COVID

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and so on, that these balance
sheets are now an order

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
or two orders of magnitude
larger than they used to be.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But in other words,
they have had

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to do lots of expansionary
monetary policy

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:90%
over the last couple of decades.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So let me talk a little bit
about interest rate and bond

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.520 align:middle line:84%
prices because that's the
other side of this thing.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.063 align:middle line:84%
So what is the connection--
because sometimes it's

00:35:50.063 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
easier to understand
things in terms of prices

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and in terms of bonds?

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So suppose a bond pays
$100 a year from now

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and no coupon in between.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy a bond
now for some price PB,

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
you get $100 a year from now.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So what is the interest
rate of that bond?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
That is, what is the excess
return that you get out

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.040 align:middle line:84%
of that, or the return you
get out of buying that bond?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's going to be $100
minus whatever you pay today--

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:90%
say you pay $95, then $5--

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
divided by your investment,
initial investment,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:90%
which was 95.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:32.493 align:middle line:84%
So that's a bond that gives
you a little bit more than 5%.

00:36:32.493 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's the return.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.243 align:middle line:90%
That's the interest.

00:36:34.243 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's the connection between
interest rate and prices.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And notice that this
is an inverse relation.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
When the price of
a bone goes up,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.282 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate goes down
because you're paying more

00:36:47.282 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:90%
for the same principal.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get 100.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But now you're
paying more for it.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means the interest
rate, the return on that bond,

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:90%
went down.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, you can
say that I went around.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The high is the interest rate,
the lower is the price of bond.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.885 align:middle line:84%
So for example, today
the interest rate is 5%.

00:37:04.885 --> 00:37:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
If I want to issue a bond
that doesn't pay any coupon

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm completely safe,
so I'm the US Treasury,

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be able to
sell that bond for 95.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, when the
interest rate was 0,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.870 align:middle line:84%
the Fed would have been able
to sell that bond for 100.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is an
inverse relationship

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.960 align:middle line:84%
between the interest rate
and the price of bonds.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And now I can take you back
to my open market operations.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.313 align:middle line:90%
So remember what I said.

00:37:37.313 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:84%
There's another
way of remembering

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:90%
which way these signs go.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you have an
expansionary monetary operation,

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I said the Fed goes out
there with a bag of money

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and buys bonds from the market.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.907 align:middle line:84%
When bonds, when
you buy something,

00:37:51.907 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
when there is an enormous
increase in demand

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.407 align:middle line:84%
for something, what
do you think happens

00:37:55.407 --> 00:37:58.150 align:middle line:90%
to the price of that something?

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Goes up for anything--
cars, whatever it is.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot more demand,
then prices will go up.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:90%
And the Fed has a lot of cash.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So he can really buy
large amounts of bonds.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
Fed goes out there

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and does an expansionary
open market operation,

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:84%
means it goes out there
and buys a lot of bonds.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The price of those
bonds goes up.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And by that formula, that means
the interest rate is going down.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's another way of
understanding how is it

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
an expansion open market
operation lowers the interest

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:84%
rate, because it raises
the price of the bonds

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:90%
that it's demanding.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise the
price of the bonds,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.595 align:middle line:84%
then the interest
rate goes down.

00:38:38.595 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So really, the only
thing I really--

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand
what I just said well

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:90%
because we're going to use it.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand
what comes next ideally well,

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's OK if you don't
understand it too well.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
when you have to start

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:90%
understanding very well again.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.330 align:middle line:84%
For now, this is a piece in
which, what I'm doing here

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
is making things a little
bit more realistic.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:90%
The message will be similar.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
bit more complicated.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason,
substantively,

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I already told you what
I wanted to tell you.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.995 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to tell
you now will give you

00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more realism,
and therefore will

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
allow you to
understand a little bit

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
better a technical description
of monetary policy or something

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So in practice in the
economy I just described,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.650 align:middle line:84%
you had sort of households and
firms and the central bank.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, there are lots
of financial intermediaries.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And in financial intermediaries,
the most prominent of them,

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.227 align:middle line:84%
for especially for monetary
policy, are the banks.

00:39:57.227 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
banks, actually,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.518 align:middle line:84%
that are even more
important than others.

00:40:00.518 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But banks are financial
intermediaries.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They take money from someone
or they post it from someone

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and lend it to someone else,
or buy some instruments.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So the intermediate
the funds of somebody

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that wants to save in the bank,
a deposit and a deposit account

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.910 align:middle line:84%
or something, and
they lend that money,

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:26.340 align:middle line:84%
effectively in the name of the
other person, to someone else.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So banks do two things to
the model I just described.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:84%
The first is that they
produce money, as well.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Because money is
made of currency,

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
which is issued by
the central bank.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's also made of
checkable deposits.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.240 align:middle line:84%
If you have a checking
account, something

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:84%
you can have a debit card
against or something like that,

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:90%
then that's money for you.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:05.950 align:middle line:84%
If you deposit in a bank in a
checking account, that's money.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And so banks, the
liabilities of banks,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.152 align:middle line:84%
the deposits is part
of money, is something

00:41:12.152 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:90%
you can use for transactions.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.235 align:middle line:90%
You can write checks.

00:41:14.235 --> 00:41:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You can use your debit
card and stuff like that.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing that banks do.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The other thing the banks do is
they, themselves, have a deposit

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:90%
account at the central bank.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So they, themselves, take
part of this deposit.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They take the deposit.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Part of the deposit they
lend to other people.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Another part they buy
financial instruments, bonds,

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
In this economy
would be only bonds.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And the other part, smaller
part, 10% or something

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:54.330 align:middle line:84%
like that, they deposit
at the central bank.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:84%
That deposit at the central
bank is called reserves.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear the word
reserves or the banking sector,

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
this is the deposits of the
banks at the central bank.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's also a liability
for the central bank.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The central bank is holding
that deposit of the banks.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not the central
bank's money.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.932 align:middle line:90%
It's the bank's money.

00:42:17.932 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:90%
And they're holding it there.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.505 align:middle line:90%
It's a liability, as well.

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you look at how
the balance sheets look,

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:84%
our central bank
now has more things.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.865 align:middle line:90%
It has assets.

00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be bonds.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
In this economy, it's the
only thing you can have.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But now it will
have the currency

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that it had before and
in the liabilities,

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.410 align:middle line:84%
but also will have the
reserves, the deposits

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:90%
of the banks themselves.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, and this is
called-- this stuff here

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:90%
is called central bank money.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, it's called central
bank-- has so many names--

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
it's called central
bank money, high power

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.480 align:middle line:90%
money, some other name.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:90%
They have it some.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:90%
But it has several names.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And what is it?

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I like the name
central bank money

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
because that's in contrast
with this kind of money.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the money that the
banking sector produces,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.620 align:middle line:90%
the checkable deposits.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is the money
produced by the central bank.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And then through deposits, the
financial system, the banks

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:90%
themselves produce more money.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So the total money in
the system is much more

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:36.070 align:middle line:84%
than the central bank money
because deposits is a big thing.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:84%
This is much larger
than that in practice.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So how does this
change our model?

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Not really much.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason I don't
care too much if you understand

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:90%
this last two slides.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So let me rederive what
we had with this approach,

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.270 align:middle line:90%
with this extension.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.792 align:middle line:84%
So money, the money is
the same as it used to be.

00:44:00.792 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you're
going to demand it

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:84%
in the form of currency or
checking accounts or something

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But the total money demand
is exactly as it used to be.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Banks typically hold a share.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And assume for now that
there is no currency.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So everything is in
deposit, otherwise

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:84%
you get a more
complicated formula.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So no one holds cash, which
is probably quite realistic

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.710 align:middle line:90%
nowadays.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has a checking
account, and that's it.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So the banks typically hold,
for regulatory reasons,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.110 align:middle line:90%
a share of their deposit.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.300 align:middle line:84%
They have a minimum
for regulatory reasons,

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.660 align:middle line:84%
a minimum share of
the deposit they have

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that they need to hold
in the form of reserves.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call that
a fixed fraction, theta.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So if all the money is held
in the form of deposits,

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:84%
then theta, which is
a number like 0.1,

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
say, times the deposit,
which is money demand,

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the reserves,
is equal to the demand

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.392 align:middle line:90%
for central bank money.

00:45:12.392 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the demand
for central bank money

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:18.240 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
reserves that the banks want

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.350 align:middle line:90%
to have at the central bank.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So the demand, they want to
have this amount of deposits

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:90%
at the central bank.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:90%
This we'll call Hd.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It's theta times Md.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.278 align:middle line:84%
And so now, rather than M,
what the central bank controls

00:45:31.278 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
really-- because it's the only
thing you can really control--

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:39.070 align:middle line:84%
is the money that it issues,
which is the central bank money.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Supplying M, which
used to be currency.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Now M is a bigger thing
because of deposits

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:90%
and all sort of stuff.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But the central
bank is the one that

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.840 align:middle line:84%
controls how much high power
money, how much central bank

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.520 align:middle line:90%
money, it issues.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to call that H.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to
my balance sheet here,

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:01.150 align:middle line:84%
the central bank cannot control
total money because it cannot

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:84%
control the amount of checkable
deposits in the economy.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But it can control
this money here.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And since we have no
currency in my example,

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:14.180 align:middle line:84%
it really can control how much
supply of reserves it can do.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have a
demand for reserves,

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:84%
which is just proportional
to money demand,

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
equal to some fixed
amount, H, which

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is the supply of high powered
money by the central bank.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:28.038 align:middle line:84%
And then the equilibrium
looks exactly like before.

00:46:28.038 --> 00:46:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be some--
remember, before we

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:34.240 align:middle line:90%
have M equal to dollar YLi.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we're saying it's not
M. It's theta times M,

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.760 align:middle line:84%
really, because it's a
fraction only of total money.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Has to be equal to money demand.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not total money demand.

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the money
that ends up being

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:90%
demand for central bank money.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Because total money demand
is the checking account.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:84%
That leads to demand
for central bank money

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.930 align:middle line:84%
by the banks, which is theta
times those deposits, not

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:03.797 align:middle line:90%
the full deposits.

00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't take all the deposits
and deposit the central bank.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.330 align:middle line:84%
They say only 10%
of those deposits

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:84%
will keep them at
the central bank.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So $100 in deposit, if theta
is 0.1, $100 in deposit

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
leads to a demand
for reserves, that

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is for deposits by the bank
and the central bank, of $10.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is the thing
that the central bank

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:90%
can control very well.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the demand
that comes to me.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.400 align:middle line:90%
The central bank is $10.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And I decide whether
we do $10 or not.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
We can do 5 and then we're going
to have the interest rate sort

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:90%
out 5 to be an equilibrium.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So if the banking
sector wanted 10

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.153 align:middle line:84%
and I'm only going to
supply 5, then something,

00:47:45.153 --> 00:47:46.570 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate
is going to have

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to rise so that the deposits
decline, less demand for money,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and the final demand that
gets to me is 5, not 10.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But the mechanism
is exactly the same.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I know this can be
a little confusing.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:84%
But the mechanism
is exactly the same.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.980 align:middle line:90%
This just illustrates--

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
important because it's

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:84%
institutional important, more
than conceptually important.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.125 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the market where
really the interest rate is set.

00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:84%
That market, the market
for reserves, really,

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because what the
banks do is they

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:84%
want reserves, deposit
at the central bank.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.170 align:middle line:84%
That market for reserves,
the interest rate

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.400 align:middle line:84%
in that market for reserves, is
called the Federal Funds Rate.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
Federal Funds Rate

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:84%
because the federal
reserves controls that rate.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So when there is a meeting by
the Fed or a policy announcement

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and it tell you that the Fed has
increased the rate by 50 basis

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.140 align:middle line:84%
points, it means
it has increased

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.580 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate in that
market by 50 basis points.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So the interest rate that the
central bank controls directly

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.980 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Federal Funds Rate.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Federal Funds
Rate is that market,

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is the market for reserve
for high powered money.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So all the operations
happen there.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.685 align:middle line:84%
They don't participate
in the deposit

00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:10.810 align:middle line:90%
market, anything like that.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They participate in that
market, which every night is

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.790 align:middle line:90%
a huge number of transactions.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Every night because I put
all the banks together.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But what happens every
night is some banks

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.610 align:middle line:84%
have more reserves
than they need.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.735 align:middle line:84%
Some other banks have less
reserves than they need.

00:49:23.735 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So the supply and demand within
the banking sector for reserves,

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and there is an interest rate
that tends to equilibrate,

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.212 align:middle line:84%
if too many banks
are short reserves,

00:49:32.212 --> 00:49:34.420 align:middle line:84%
then there is going to be
lots of demand for reserves

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.503 align:middle line:84%
and the interest rates are
going to tend to go up.

00:49:36.503 --> 00:49:38.260 align:middle line:84%
If the Fed doesn't
want that interest rate

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to go up, then what
it will do overnight,

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.580 align:middle line:84%
it will go there
and inject reserves

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.240 align:middle line:84%
into the system,
high power money.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So the interest rate in
that market comes down.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
the Fed operates.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it controls it.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Participates in that market.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Controls the amount
of high power

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.490 align:middle line:84%
money, which regulates the
rate in the reserves market.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And here it's only--

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and then so here you have the
major banks participating here.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And then this leaks into
the other interest rates

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in the economy, into the deposit
rates, to bond rates, and so on.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But the real rate
they control, the rate

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that they control most
directly, is that right here.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
I wanted to give you

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.440 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of institutional--

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to add
complexity, so you

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:84%
could get to this word,
Federal Funds Rate

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because that's what you want
to read in the newspapers.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.800 align:middle line:84%
The Fed increased the federal
funds target, it's going to say.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Because they target.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.680 align:middle line:84%
They cannot guarantee
there's going to be a target

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:90%
in an interest rate.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And typically, they
give you a range.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a very narrow range.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Let me just conclude by
showing you how that rate has

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.270 align:middle line:90%
looked in the US recently.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And I finish here.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.090 align:middle line:90%
So here is before COVID.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The interest rate, the Fed was
already hiking interest rates.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It had overdone it there so it
was beginning to lower interest

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:07.710 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And then COVID came and they cut
interest rate very aggressively.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.145 align:middle line:84%
This is the maximum
they can cut it to.

00:51:13.145 --> 00:51:15.437 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
that briefly in the next,

00:51:15.437 --> 00:51:16.390 align:middle line:90%
to zero.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:90%
You cannot go below zero.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You cannot pay negative interest
rate because then I don't demand

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.340 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't demand bonds.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Why should I hold
a bond that pays me

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.640 align:middle line:84%
a negative interest rate
when cash pays 0, always 0?

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.183 align:middle line:84%
I can keep it under
the mattress and I

00:51:30.183 --> 00:51:31.350 align:middle line:90%
don't pay anything negative.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So the interest rate,
the lowest can be 0.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And you see that they did
the maximum they could

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of cutting
interest rate.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They went to 0, effectively 0.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And now they have been
trying to catch up

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.910 align:middle line:90%
because inflation is very high.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying
to hike interest rates.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And you see what they're doing.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, all those interventions
happen in the reserve market.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the rate, is in
that market over there.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I think we're meeting
on Tuesday next week.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:01.540 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the plan.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:90%
