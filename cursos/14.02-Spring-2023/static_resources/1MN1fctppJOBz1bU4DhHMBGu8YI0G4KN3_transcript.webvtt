00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
RICARDEO CABALLERO:
I couldn't connect.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed just hiked
by 25 basis points.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:90%
And as people expected--

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:90%
this is the way it works.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.005 align:middle line:84%
When there's lots
of uncertainty,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
essentially, the Fed
starts communicating

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to do,
and the communication

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
was very clear that 25 basis
points was to be expected.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And apparently-- I was
reading this right now.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It was released 3 minutes
ago, 4 minutes ago--

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
they also said that further
hikes are no longer guaranteed.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So remember that we saw
that expected hikes--

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
we saw several expected
hikes for the next few months

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
before the SVB mess.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And right after it, we saw
the whole thing declining.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And at least the minutes
are consistent with that.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:90%
So there we are.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.523 align:middle line:90%
So not big uncertainty.

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I imagine the markets are
rallying or something like that,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
at least for the next
10 minutes or so.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
But we shall see.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, but today, we're
going to really start--

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you the
first model of economic growth.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.915 align:middle line:84%
And before I do that, who
knows who that person is?

00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
No, no clue?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Actually, he's Robert Solow.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
He's an emeritus
professor at MIT.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Together with Paul
Samuelson, essentially, he's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
responsible for building the
Economics Department at MIT.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And he won the Nobel
Prize in 1987--

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a student then here--

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
primarily for his work
on economic growth.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going to do in
the next two or three lectures

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
are essentially things that Bob
Solow developed many, many years

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The basic mechanism--
you remember

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that we had this Keynesian
cross before where

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.265 align:middle line:84%
we had this multiplier
in the goods market

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and aggregate demand feeding
into income and so on and so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
That was the star mechanism
in short-run macro.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
In long-run macro growth theory,
this is the key mechanism,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can think of
it as the following.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
At any point in
time, an economy has

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
factors of production--
primarily, labor and capital.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
That capital is stock.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Labor is more or
less fixed, so it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
depends on population,
growth, things

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
that are difficult to
control, or they're not

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
really that endogenous to
economics, not, at least,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
in the current times.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Many centuries ago,
yes, they were.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We had this Malthusian theories,
in which population growth

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
determined growth because food
scarcity and stuff like that.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's no longer
the case, fortunately,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.636 align:middle line:90%
in most parts of the world.

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But what can change over
time and quite a bit,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and it depends on economic
decisions, is the capital stock.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But at any point in time, there
is certain capital stocks,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
which, combined with labor,
give you some certain output.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Output is income.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Part of that income will
be saved, as we have seen.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And those savings will
be used for investment.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But investment is nothing else
than capital accumulation.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So this income will
lead to savings,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:84%
which will fund
investment, which

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
will change the
stock of capital,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.862 align:middle line:84%
will feed into the
capital stock, that will

00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
feed into income, and so on.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
All this is happening very
slowly because the capital

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
stock accumulates slowly.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.595 align:middle line:90%
But this is what is happening.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so all the
models we're going

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.845 align:middle line:84%
to look at-- certainly,
the model we're going

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
to look at in this lecture
is all about this mechanism.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.005 align:middle line:84%
So let's remember what we
did in the previous lecture.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to assume
that population is constant.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to relax
that at the very end.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But assume that the population
is constant and equal to N.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're not worried
about unemployment and stuff

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:90%
like that here.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And so output per capita
or per person is Y over N.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And we remember we had
a production function

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
f of K and N. Then because
of constant returns to scale,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
we could divide by N on
both sides, everything.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up with
this relationship.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So output per
person is equal to--

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing function
of capital per person.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an increasing function
of capital per person,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a concave
function of capital per person.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is it concave?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
That is, why is it
increasing at a smaller pace?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.212 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It's decreasing
marginal method.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
RICARDEO CABALLERO:
Decreasing marginal product

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
of capital, exactly.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
For fixed amount of
labor, the more capital

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
you put into production,
well, output keeps expanding,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
but by less and less because
it has less and less labor

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to work with, each
unit of capital.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
work in closed economy.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I haven't opened it.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
that after quiz 2.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to assume, also,
no public deficits-- so g

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
equal to T, capital
T. And in that case,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
then, we know that private
investment-- private savings

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
equal to private investment.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we
derived our S curve.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's not new.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to modify a little bit
what we did in the short run,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
assume that savings

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
is proportional to income.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So savings-- little
s times Y. Notice

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that this is different from
what we did in the short run.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
In the short run, remember,
we had a C0 floating around.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
We had a constant in the
consumption function.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So savings, which was equal
to income minus consumption,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
also had a constant
floating around.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, that constant was
important in the short-run model

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
because we were approximating
for a bunch of things that are

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
not related to
short-term income--

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.500 align:middle line:84%
wealth, the price of
houses, and stuff like that.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We put all that in
that constant there.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
the long run, though,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
most of those things
that we excluded there--

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
asset prices, stuff like that--

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
tend to scale with
output, as well.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So these are inconsistent
on the surface.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
to fully work out

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:84%
what is behind the C0 in
the consumption function,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
then this is not a
bad approximation.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They are not that
inconsistent because you

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
endogenize things that, over
the long run, scale with income.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wealth tends
to rise with income,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and all these things tend
to move together-- not

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:90%
at high frequency.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You can have all
sorts of fluctuations.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But over the long run, they
tend to scale up together.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
our saving function.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So that means that we
know, in equilibrium--

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:90%
this is not investment function.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
We know that, in equilibrium,
investment will be equal to--

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
it will be
proportional to income.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So remember where we were
going through the box.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
box, we had capital.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:90%
That led to output.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We're doing
everything per capita.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
That led to savings, and
that funded investment.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we have.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So this growth model is really
about these three functional

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
forms and then a
dynamic equation

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:90%
for the stock of capital.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So the evolution of
the stock of capital--

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
capital will increase
because of investment.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what investment is.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an increase in
the stock of capital.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But it will also decrease
as a result of depreciation.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.043 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things do break
up once in a while.

00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And different types of capital
have different depreciation

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Equipment depreciates much
faster than structures,

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and buildings, and so on.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to make
those distinctions here.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But you see this tells you,
the capital stock at t plus 1

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the capital
stock we had before minus

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
what is depreciated of
that stock of capital

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
plus any new
investment we do today.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
In per worker terms-- and
remember that, for now,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm keeping population
growth constant--

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
equal to 0-- not
population growth

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
constant-- yeah,
constant, but equal to 0.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:90%
So population is constant.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I can divide these
both sides by N,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and I get that
capital per worker.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Per worker or per person is
equal to this expression here.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I did two things here.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I divided by N, and I
replaced this I function,

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.837 align:middle line:84%
this investment, for
savings because I

00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
know, in equilibrium,
they have to be equal.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:90%
So I have that.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I can rewrite this.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Just subtract Kt
over N on both sides,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and then you get-- the
change in capital per person

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
is an increasing
function of savings

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and decreasing of depreciation.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So the last step that is
important in this model is to--

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
so here, I have, essentially, a
difference equation for capital,

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
but we have an output per
capita on the right-hand side.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that I
know that output per capita,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:90%
per person--

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.432 align:middle line:90%
I said per capita, per person.

00:10:10.432 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:90%
They're the same thing.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Per worker-- it's the same thing
in this part of the course.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.286 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to--

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is a function, is an
increasing and concave function

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
of capital per person.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- I would say
it's a fundamental equation

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:90%
of the Solow growth model.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
It says, the change in the
stock of capital increases

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
with investment, of course, and
decreases with depreciation.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And both of these
expressions here

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are increasing functions of the
stock of capital per person.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to understand
what is in here.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So why-- so this is
linear, obviously,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
because the
depreciation is linear.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Say you lose 5% of your
stock of capital every year

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:90%
because it breaks down.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the more capital
per person you have,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the more units of capital
you're going to lose.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
This is units of
capital per person.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You have a larger stock of
capital, you're going to lose--

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.688 align:middle line:84%
5% of a larger number
is a larger number.

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is proportional.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one--
remember, this comes here

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%
from the saving function.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And this term here is
equal to income per person.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose that you
start in a situation

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
where the capital stock
is relatively low,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and this is positive.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
that this is positive?

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the implication
of this being positive

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the stock of capital
per person will be growing.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.855 align:middle line:84%
But what does it mean that
it's positive in words?

00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a
stock of capital.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
reduce the stock of capital,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and there are things that
increase the stock of capital.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing that
increases the stock of capital.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing that
reduces the stock of capital.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So if this is greater than
that, what does that mean?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:90%
That means it is positive.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:90%
But in words, what is happening?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And we simplify,
but remember, this

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:90%
is just investment per person.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, this just says
that in this economy,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
there is more investment
than destruction

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of capital due to depreciation.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what this means.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
This is investment.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is positive means
that the investment, which

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
is a function of saving,
the saving rate, and stuff

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
it's a function of the funding
available for investment--

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
it's equal to the funding
available for investment.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
If this is positive,
well, this is greater

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:90%
than the stock of capital.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying it--
you need a minimum level

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.915 align:middle line:84%
of investment in an economy to
maintain the stock of capital.

00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:20.282 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.282 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The minimum level
of investment you

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
need to maintain
the stock of capital

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:90%
is equal to the depreciation.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So 10 machine breaks, you need
to invest at least 10 machines

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain the
stock of capital constant.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.658 align:middle line:84%
Now if this is
positive, it means

00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're investing more
than the machines that

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:90%
are breaking down.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose you start in a
situation where that's the case.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So that means the stock
of capital is growing.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Suppose I ask you,
the next period,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:84%
do you think the gap will
be larger or smaller than it

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:90%
used to be?

00:13:52.070 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's
not a great question

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not doing it in
the right units for that.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a variation
of that question.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Suppose we keep going.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
After a while, do
you think that number

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:90%
will get larger or smaller?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Let it run for quite a while.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that number will--
so remember what I'm saying.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We start from some
stock of capital.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.333 align:middle line:90%
This is positive.

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
If this is positive, it
means that the capital stock

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
is growing.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
That means this guy is growing,
and that guy is growing,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're growing equally.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, do you
think this number will

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:90%
get smaller or bigger--

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
after a long while,
just to make sure

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that my approximation
is not tidy.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.448 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.448 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Smaller because of
the decrease in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.097 align:middle line:90%
RICARDEO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get smaller
because this guy keeps

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
growing linearly [INAUDIBLE]
and this one is not.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:90%
It's concave.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
At some point, this income--

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
you need to put a lot
of capital for income

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to keep rising, and
therefore, for saving

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to keep rising, and therefore,
for investment to keep rising.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.378 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, yes, it
won't be able to really grow.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're going to be using
all your investment, really,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the
stock of capital.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the logic
of the Solow model.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.532 align:middle line:90%
And it's all in this diagram.

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the diagram you
should really, really understand

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
well and control it, and
play with it, and all that.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the equivalent
to your IS-LM

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
model in the first
part of the course.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:90%
So look at what we have here.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to plot
output per worker--

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
per worker, per person--

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
against capital per worker here.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this red line here
is just the depreciation,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:84%
this term here, and thus,
is a linear function

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:90%
of the capital per worker.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The blue line here is output
per worker, which, as we said,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is a concave function
of K over N. Remember,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I showed you that
production function

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
in the previous lecture.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:90%
What is the green line?

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It's investment
per worker, which

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:90%
is equal to saving per worker.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And saving per worker is
little s, the saving rate,

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:90%
times a output.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's little s, which
is a number like 0.1,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about
the US, and 0.4 if we're

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
talking about Singapore.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.395 align:middle line:84%
It varies a lot
across countries.

00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So this green line
here is nothing else

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.342 align:middle line:84%
than this blue line multiplied
by a number that is less than 1.

00:17:01.342 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason it's lower.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So the point I was describing
before was a point like this.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
The point I was describing--

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
suppose that the economy starts
in a point like this one, K0

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
over N. And I want to understand
the dynamics of this economy.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
How will it grow over time?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So what you see here
is that, at this level

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of capital per
worker, investment

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
is greater than depreciation.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly
a situation where

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:50.585 align:middle line:84%
this is positive That
distance here is that.

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
said, ah, I'm not

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
going to do any local analysis
because we could have started

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
with a K over 0 over here, and
then that number is growing.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's growing-- if
you were to normalize

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.645 align:middle line:84%
by the stock of
capital, it's declining.

00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to do that then.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But now, that's what I--
so let's look at this case.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
You're in a situation
where this is positive.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
If this is positive, it means
the capital stock per worker

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:90%
is growing.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:90%
So you're moving to the right.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
In the next period,
you're going to be here.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
That means the
capital-- so it keeps

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:90%
growing but by smaller steps.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
investment is entirely

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
used for recovering from
the depreciation of capital,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
so covering the
depreciation of capital.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the
capital stock stops growing.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We call that a steady
state, stationary state.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:90%
We stop there.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's the steady
state of this model.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.892 align:middle line:84%
That means this economy,
regardless of where I--

00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll do the analysis
from the other side.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.683 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that you start
from a situation like this.

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:90%
You start with a lot of capital.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you start with a lot
of capital in this economy,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:90%
what happens here?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens here
is that the investment

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
you're putting into the
ground in this economy

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is less than what you need to
maintain the stock of capital,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:90%
which is the depreciation.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And that means the
stock of capital

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:90%
will be shrinking over time.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:90%
You're moving that way.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of where
you start in this economy,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
if I ask you the question
A hundred years from now,

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.998 align:middle line:90%
where are you?

00:19:36.998 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
you tell me, I don't need to
know where you start from.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that we're going
to end up around there.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You can-- either you start
from here, you can go there.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.063 align:middle line:84%
From here, you go
there and so on.

00:19:46.063 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we
call this a steady state.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.185 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
converge in the long run.

00:19:50.185 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is already interesting
because it tells you,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
at this point here, the
economy was growing.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
The capital stock was growing,
and output was growing.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:90%
You see the capital--

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
if you start from here, the
capital stock is growing.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, output is also growing.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
You're moving up.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
So you had growth.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
That kind of growth we
call transitional growth.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It goes from one point
to another point.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a permanent growth.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a transitional growth.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that you were
away from your steady state,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going convergent
towards your steady state.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the growth we observed
and the difference of growth we

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
observed across
countries-- remember,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.583 align:middle line:84%
I showed you those
downward-sloping curves and all

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:90%
is as a result of that.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.242 align:middle line:84%
Poorer economies tend
to have lower capital--

00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:84%
capital labor, capital
employment ratios,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:90%
capital population ratios.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they tend to grow
faster because they're catching

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
up with the steady state.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Very advanced economies
that have been more or less

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in the same place for a long
time are moving around there,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
so there's less
catching up growth.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main responsible
for the downward-sloping

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:84%
curve I showed you within OECD
countries and even broader

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Africa was a little
bit of a problem there.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is an
important model

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:90%
for you, important diagram.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's play a little with it.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that, at the time--
this is a very simple model.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, the
view was that, well,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
what really supports
growth is savings.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So economies that
save a lot grow a lot.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of
makes sense here

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
because investment,
which is what

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
leads to capital accumulation,
is entirely funded by savings.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
You have more savings,
you should grow more.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is something--
we can do an experiment.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you start at a
steady state, if you will.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And now we increase
the savings rate.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:90%
What moves?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:09.722 align:middle line:90%
Which curve?

00:22:09.722 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
thing you should know

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
when you work with this model.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
If I change the saving rate,
which curve moves in this model?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me go one by one.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Does the red line move?

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with savings.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.852 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with depreciation.

00:22:27.852 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If I move depreciation rate,
that curve will move, but not--

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
will the production
function move?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So the blue line cannot move.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
All that will move
is the green line

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
because the green line is the
saving rate times the blue line.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I increase
the saving rate,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to move
the green line up.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have here.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So you see what
happens is you start--

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
this was a steady state for this
saving rate in this economy.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden, this
economy starts saving more.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
This tells you very
much the story of Asia.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The Asia miracle of the '60s,
'70s, and so on is very much

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:90%
something like that--

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:90%
a little more complicated.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
A big part of what explains
the fast growth of Asia

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.943 align:middle line:84%
during that period is that
something like that happened.

00:23:27.943 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, why the savings
rate increase and so on--

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.443 align:middle line:84%
that's all very
interesting and so on.

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's not what I
want to discuss today.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:90%
So what happened here, then?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.402 align:middle line:84%
So what happens-- this
economy was in a steady state.

00:23:39.402 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:90%
So there was no growth.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It was growing at 0 in a
steady state because this says,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in a steady state, output
per worker remains constant.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And since we have no
population growth,

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that means output is
not growing, either.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The only way you
can have that ratio

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
constant with the
denominator not moving

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the numerator
is not moving, either.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, boom, all of a sudden,
we get a higher saving rate.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
So what happens now?

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:11.595 align:middle line:90%
What reacts?

00:24:11.595 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So the saving rates go up.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a closed economy.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
It means the investment
rate will go up.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:90%
What happens now?

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:90%
What does that gap tell you?

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a
positive gap there,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:84%
which means you're investing
more than what you need in order

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the stock of capital
at the previous steady state.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.645 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
the stock of capital

00:24:46.645 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to start
growing to the right.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's going to start growing.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And as the stock of capital
grows, then output per capita

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:90%
also grows.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And this will keep
happening until you

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:90%
reach the new steady state.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So a higher saving rate-- so
important conclusion there.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
This, as simple as it
is, proves something--

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that the conventional wisdom
that the higher saving

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
rate would give you sustained
growth, higher growth,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
isn't really true,
certainly not in this model.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you'll go
back to growth equal to 0.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
When you reach a
new steady state,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
also growing at 0.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
What is true, though,
is that you get, again,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
what is called transitional
growth because here, you're

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
going to start growing
very fast, in fact.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to keep growing

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
at the lowest-- lower, lower
pace until you go back to 0.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.503 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
get lots of growth

00:25:47.503 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in the transition
as a result of that.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out,
in the data, when

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
20, 30 years of data,

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to disentangle
very permanent rates of growth

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
versus transitional
rate of growth.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things that
has concerned China quite a bit.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:90%
They grow very, very fast.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
They have been growing very,
very fast for a long time.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's very clear that it's
becoming harder and harder

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
for them to grow at the
type of rates of growth

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:90%
that they had 20 years ago.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
They had rates of
growth 15% or so.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
They had very high-- they had
a very low initial capital

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:90%
population ratio--

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
big population, little capital,
and enormous savings rates.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:90%
So they grew very, very fast.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
They had the green
line very close

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to the blue line, the
capital stock very low,

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.808 align:middle line:84%
so they grew very, very fast but
they have been growing very fast

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:90%
for a very long period of time.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So now it's getting a lot
harder because they're

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
getting closer and closer
to their steady state.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the issue.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
There are other
sources of growth,

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're going to
talk about in the next lecture.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.783 align:middle line:84%
But this is sometimes called
the easy part of growth.

00:26:56.783 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of running
out in China.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has run out in
all developed economies

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:90%
for quite a while.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Is this clear?

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a question like that is
guaranteed in your quiz for 81.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.438 align:middle line:84%
What happens if the saving
rate does something?

00:27:32.438 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is a plot over time.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is a case in which
you were in a steady state.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And at time t, the
saving rate goes up

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:90%
as 1 greater than 0 jump.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Then output cannot jump.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.845 align:middle line:84%
So the saving rate goes up, but
output cannot jump at day 0.

00:27:53.845 --> 00:27:54.345 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:54.345 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the output
doesn't jump immediately

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:90%
to a new steady state?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:90%
This is the--

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, this is what
will happen to output.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
growing very fast early on,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and then keep
growing, keep growing

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:84%
at a slower and lower pace
because of decreasing returns

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:90%
to capital.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll convert
to the new steady state

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
with the rate of growth equal to
0, like the one you had before,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:90%
this savings shock.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And the question I'm asking
now is, why does output

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:90%
have to do this?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Why doesn't it just jump?

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.895 align:middle line:84%
What is the only variable
that could make it jump?

00:28:37.895 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.465 align:middle line:84%
So you need to look at
the production function.

00:28:43.465 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
The production function
is the function

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
of K over N. N is fixed.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can make it
jump is the capital stock jumps,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
but the capital
stock is not jumping.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a stock.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
accumulate a larger

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:84%
stock of the new
steady state, you're

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
a lot of flows.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:59.825 align:middle line:90%
That's investment.

00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Every year, you're going
to be adding a little more

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to the stock of capital.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the way you grow.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not that, all of a sudden,
your stock of capital jumps.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.342 align:middle line:84%
That's very much because
this is a closed economy.

00:29:13.342 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're in an open
economy, the capital stock

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
can move a lot faster
in a transition

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:84%
because you can
borrow from abroad.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to fund it
all with domestic sources.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's
what typically happens

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in emerging markets and so
on is they typically borrow

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Problem is that they tend to
consume it rather than invest

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.723 align:middle line:84%
it, and that's the reason you
end up in financial crisis

00:29:35.723 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But in principle,
things could go

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
much faster if you
have an open economy,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and you have capital
inflows into your country.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But we'll talk more about that
five or six lectures from now.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, but this is
what happens with an increase

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.403 align:middle line:90%
in the savings rate.

00:29:51.403 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it affects the rate
of growth of the economy

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.287 align:middle line:84%
during the transition
but not in the long run.

00:29:58.287 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this transition
can be very long.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about consumption?

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So invariably-- and there's
no way around that--

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:84%
given a technology and so on,
if the saving rate goes up,

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.213 align:middle line:84%
then output per
worker will go up.

00:30:20.213 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The next question
is, what happens

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:90%
to consumption per worker?

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Does consumption per
worker go up or not?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:84%
You are inclined to
say, well, I mean,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense that it goes up
because we have more income.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
If the saving rate is
little less times y,

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
then consumption is 1
minus little s times Y.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So income goes up,
consumption should go up.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that's a
dominant source.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not all the
story because remember

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:90%
what I told you.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So consumption here is going
to be equal to 1 minus little

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
s times Y. So consumption
per person will be that.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember that what is
increasing Y over N there--

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:84%
so what is making
this guy go up,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
which will lead to an increase
in consumption over N--

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:90%
is that this guy went up.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a force in
the opposite direction.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that was one of
the debates with the Southeast

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Asian miracle is that it was
fueled by lots of savings.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So people say, OK,
that's wonderful.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Your output growth is very
fast, but consumption growth

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:90%
is not so fast.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it
may be hurting you.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.503 align:middle line:84%
I think that they were right,
though, for other reasons.

00:31:52.503 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But that picture
makes the point.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So if your saving rate to start
with-- this is a general lesson.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
If the saving rate you start
with is very, very low,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.695 align:middle line:84%
then an increase
in the saving rate

00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
will lead to a strong
increase in consumption

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
because this change is small
relative to the big bang

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
get in output because, if
you have low saving rate,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that also means that the
capital stock is very low.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:26.027 align:middle line:84%
And if the capital stock is
very low, f prime is very big.

00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a concave
function, and you're

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
in the steep part
of the function.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Later on, if saving
is very high,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:84%
you're going to tend to have
capital stock very high.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, first of
all, more capital

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:84%
won't increase output
per worker a lot

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
because of decreasing returns.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big number,
so it starts dominating.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you see here.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
This economy has
increased the saving rate.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Consumption per worker rises.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
it reaches a maximum,

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:90%
and then it starts declining.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think of the limit.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
If you save 100% of your income,
you don't consume anything.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much
is your output,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
if your saving
rate is 100%, then

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
consume anything.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have no income, no
savings rate, no savings,

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
no capital stock,
no income, you're

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.530 align:middle line:84%
not going to consume
anything either.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.988 align:middle line:84%
So at least you know
these two points.

00:33:20.988 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And since you know there
are some positive points

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.243 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:33:24.243 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You know that the
curve is going to tend

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.010 align:middle line:90%
to have that kind of change.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be nonmonotonic,
and that's the way it is.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So let me just play
with a few numbers.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
This is-- yeah, let me
play with a few numbers.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not that crazy.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have a production
function that gives equal weight

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to capital and workers--

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:90%
so this production function.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Does the production function
have constant return to scale?

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It better be because
that's what we're doing.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The sum of the exponents
is 1, so it's K to the 1/2,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:90%
N to the 1/2.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.929 align:middle line:84%
The sum of the
exponents is 1, so you

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
know that it's proportional
to a scaling factor.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
use as a scaling--

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:24.785 align:middle line:90%
as before, N. S we have this.

00:34:24.785 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a f of
little f of K over N

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.642 align:middle line:84%
is the square root of K
over N minus delta K over N.

00:34:33.642 --> 00:34:35.809 align:middle line:84%
All that I'm doing is I'm
plugging in that function.

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:84%
So here, I'm replacing
all these functions

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
by a specific
example, one in which

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
this is a square
root of K over N.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:84%
That's a concave
function-- square root.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, do it as an exercise.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.200 align:middle line:84%
If you solve for
the steady state,

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.783 align:middle line:84%
how do you solve for
the steady state?

00:35:02.783 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, set this equal to 0.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
That will give you
the steady state.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:84%
The steady state is when the
capital is not growing anymore.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It's when this is equal to 0.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
When this is equal to 0, I
can solve for the steady state

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.900 align:middle line:90%
level of K over N from here.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.720 align:middle line:84%
This equal to 0, I can
solve for K over N.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call that
the steady state, K star.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
We typically use stars for
steady states in growth theory.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer to this is K--

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the steady state, stock
of capital per person

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:84%
is the saving rate
over delta squared.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Output per person, which is
the square root of K over N,

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:84%
is, therefore, the square
root of s over delta squared,

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:90%
so it's over s delta.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular model, in
the long run, output per worker

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:84%
doubles when the
savings rate doubles.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.435 align:middle line:84%
If I double the saving
rate, then output per worker

00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:03.935 align:middle line:90%
will double.

00:36:03.935 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the
stock of capital is

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
going to grow a lot more when
you increase the savings rate.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's squared.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So in that economy, if you
do increase the savings rate

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
from 10% to 20%, this
is the way it goes.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So remember, 10% to 20%-- that
means that the new steady state

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.960 align:middle line:84%
output per worker will
be twice what it was

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:90%
in the previous steady state.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:90%
So you go from 1 to 2.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.593 align:middle line:90%
But it takes a long time.

00:36:42.593 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:90%
The numbers are [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:84%
50 years it takes you
to go to the new state.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.138 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the time
frame we're talking about.

00:36:52.138 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So it is true that the
saving rate will not

00:36:53.930 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
change the long-run rate of
growth, absent other mechanisms.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can grow faster than
your average, your steady state

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:90%
level for quite some time.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, a lot of the Asian
miracle has been of that kind.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was telling
you of China before, no?

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, you
can grow very fast,

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:84%
especially if you have saving
rate much higher than 20%--

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean 50% or so.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But the rate of growth
will have a tendency

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.325 align:middle line:84%
to decline, absent
some other miracle.

00:37:28.325 --> 00:37:30.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of the reasons
why we have all this fight

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:90%
about technology and so on.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with-- because
that's the main mechanism--

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.020 align:middle line:84%
alternative mechanism
to grow is technology.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that in the next lecture.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But this force, which
is, what I said before,

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
is the easy part of growth--

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.895 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to fight this pattern.

00:37:48.895 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So here you have numbers
for the steady states.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So if the saving rate is 0,
obviously, everything is 0--

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:90%
no way around.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If saving rate is 0.1,
10%, then, in this model,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:90%
capital per worker is 1.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Output per worker is 1.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Consumption per worker
then go from 0 to 1.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.587 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
saving something.

00:38:14.587 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's 1 minus 0.1,
which is a saving rate.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you double
the saving rate.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.063 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that we're going
to double output per worker

00:38:23.063 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in this economy.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.272 align:middle line:90%
We said that.

00:38:24.272 --> 00:38:25.830 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go from 1 to 2.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The capital stock
is going to have

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to grow a lot more to
double the amount of output.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Decreasing returns.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.740 align:middle line:84%
To double output, you're going
to have to much more than double

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
capital because you're going to
be fighting decreasing returns.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.060 align:middle line:90%
What about consumption?

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it won't
double because you're

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
doing this out of
increasing the saving rate.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So you get the 2 minus,
now, 0.2, not 0.1--

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:84%
minus 0.2 times 2, so
you get 1.6 and so on.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And the higher you go
with your saving rate,

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:09.150 align:middle line:84%
the harder it gets for
capital to bring along

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.030 align:middle line:84%
output per capita,
and the more the drag

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:84%
on consumption because you need
to be saving a lot in order

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:84%
to maintain this high stock
of capital that you're having.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
You have a very large
stock of capital.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:84%
That means you need
to save a lot just

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of maintaining
that stock of capital.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so little is left for
extra output per capita.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you see that, here,
for this particular model,

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
when the saving
rate exceeds 0.5,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
then output obviously
keeps rising

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.400 align:middle line:84%
when you increase
the saving rate,

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:90%
but output starts declining.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the declining part.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to 1, of course,
there is no consumption.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's the curve
that we trace.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Is everything clear?

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to-- that's
the basic Solow model.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a model that, again,
you need to control completely.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.190 align:middle line:84%
All that I'm going to
do now is very simple.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just modify a
little bit this model to add

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:90%
population growth.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So what happens-- by
the way, for centuries,

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.770 align:middle line:84%
population growth has been one
of the main-- in this model,

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:37.492 align:middle line:84%
we concluded that output
per worker was not growing.

00:40:37.492 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
conclude in a second

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is that output per
worker will not

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.580 align:middle line:90%
grow if population is growing.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But that means that
output is growing.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
If population is growing,
and output per worker

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:84%
is not growing, it's constant,
that means output is also

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:90%
growing.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time,
growth of output,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:84%
not of output per
worker, was driven

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:90%
by large population growth.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you get
big migration flows

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
into a country that leads
to growth and so on.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Now big parts of the world have
negative population growth.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going through
a cycle in which things

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:84%
are going the other way
around in many large parts

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:84%
This is true in almost
all of continental Europe,

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:90%
certainly in Japan.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I said South Korea, China,
and even some places

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:90%
in Latin America.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So the drag, actually,
is against that.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
natural force for growth

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that we had for
many, many years.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So let me introduce
population growth.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So assume now that population,
rather than being constant,

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
grows at the related gN, which
could be positive or negative.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the example for
a positive population growth

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.120 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's no equation
that changes, in the sense

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that this is still true.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It's still true that
investment is equal to savings.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's still true that output
is equal to output per worker,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and output is equal to f of K
and N and so on and so forth.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is
a little trickier

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:26.365 align:middle line:84%
is that, in this model, if I
don't normalize things for--

00:42:26.365 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in this case here, where
population was not growing,

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I could have just eliminated
this N as a constant.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would have done
everything in capital,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.328 align:middle line:84%
in a space of capital
here, and output here

00:42:39.328 --> 00:42:40.870 align:middle line:84%
would have been the
same, just scaled

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:43.970 align:middle line:90%
by a number, a constant N.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
When I have
population growth, I'm

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
not indifferent between doing
one way or the other because,

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:90%
if I don't have--

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:84%
if I do it in the space of K and
Y, and population is growing,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.265 align:middle line:84%
then all these
curves are moving.

00:42:58.265 --> 00:42:59.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
unfriendly diagram

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:84%
because my curves
are all moving.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.490 align:middle line:84%
As N is moving,
everything is moving.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.198 align:middle line:84%
So the trick in all
these growth models,

00:43:05.198 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be even more
important in the next lecture,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is to find the right
scaling of capital

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.740 align:middle line:84%
so there is a steady
state, so your curves

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:84%
are not moving around
as population growth.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.445 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to find
the scaling factor.

00:43:18.445 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It's population.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But remember what is
different here is--

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.110 align:middle line:84%
so what I'm saying
is I want to get

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.103 align:middle line:84%
all my variables
scaled by population

00:43:33.103 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:90%
at some point in time.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.067 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want to
do because I know--

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I practice enough with
these things-- that's going

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.233 align:middle line:90%
to give me a steady state.

00:43:39.233 --> 00:43:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is tricky
relative to what

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I showed you before is that,
before, I just divided by N

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:90%
both sides, and I was home.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Now I can't really do that.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me divide by
Nt plus 1 both sides.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I get my capital per
worker at t plus 1.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.558 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
things that are not as nice.

00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
What I have on the right-hand
side is not what I really want.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want capital over
population next period.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
My steady state is going to
be in the space of capital

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:90%
overpopulation at the same time.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:90%
That's my steady state.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.940 align:middle line:90%
So this is not so nice.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I have to do
is I want to convert

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
this, the right-hand
side, in assumption

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that these are the kind of
things that I want to have.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to do is divide

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and multiply each of these
sides by Nt over Nt plus 1--

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.090 align:middle line:90%
sorry-- I'm going to divide.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.020 align:middle line:90%
I multiply each of these by Nt.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So multiply by Nt, divide
by Nt, so multiplying by 1.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I can rearrange
the terms in this way

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.310 align:middle line:84%
so I get what I want, which is
capital per person at time t,

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.060 align:middle line:90%
all at time t.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:90%
But then I get this ratio here.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I can do the same
for this expression here.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.165 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that ratio?

00:45:03.165 --> 00:45:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.925 align:middle line:84%
It's population today divided
by population tomorrow.

00:45:09.925 --> 00:45:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's 1 over 1 plus the
rate of growth of population.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Nt plus 1 is equal to
Nt times 1 plus gN.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the rate of
growth of population.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I have here
is 1 over 1 plus gN.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, gN is not a big number.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So 1 over 1 plus gN is
approximately equal to minus gN.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So 1 over 1 plus gN--
gN is very close to 0--

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is approximately
equal to minus gN.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason this guy
became that guy-- approximately

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that guy.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I can do the same
here, but it turns out

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that there's an
extra term here which

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is equal to s times
gN times Yt over Nt.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's second-order.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
I'm going to drop it.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.974 align:middle line:90%
It's a saving rate which is--

00:46:32.974 --> 00:46:38.080 align:middle line:84%
it's a small number times a
rate of population growth, which

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is a number like 0.01
or something like that.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's a small number,
so I'm dropping it.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a bigger approximation
than that one, actually,

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to do it.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
a lot simpler.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:90%
So this is an approximation.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm just dropping
second-order terms.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And once I have that,
I have the system

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I want because now
I have a system

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution of the capital
per worker or per person.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you see, it looks
exactly as we had before.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is exactly
what we had before--

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:84%
sf K over-- we used
to have N subscript t.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Now it's K over Nt.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But what is different is that
now, rather than having only

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the depreciation rate here,
we have the depreciation rate

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
plus the rate of
growth of population.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we have the
rate of growth of population

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Remember the economics behind
this expression before.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It was this is what adds to
capital, to capital per worker.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
need to maintain,

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:55.170 align:middle line:90%
what takes away from capital.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.143 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's what takes away from--

00:47:58.143 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
given we're doing everything in
the space of capital per worker,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:90%
that takes away from capital--

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's a typo.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:04.965 align:middle line:90%
There's a t there--

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:07.880 align:middle line:90%
t.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
I have this gN here?

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have only one minute,
so I don't have time to--

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because if I want to maintain
a stock of capital per worker,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and workers are growing, then I
need to be growing the capital.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So even if I had
no depreciation,

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
if I want to maintain the
capital per worker constant,

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and workers are
growing, then I need

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:90%
to grow the stock of capital.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
maintain the capital--

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I still need to spend what I
used to spend for depreciation

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:90%
of the capital stock.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But if I want to maintain the
capital per worker constant,

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.350 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to need more
investment, just to make up

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:90%
for that extra component.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:90%
So now, set gA equal to 0.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Your diagram is exactly
as before in this space.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Set a equal to 1 and constant.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But this line, the red line
here will have delta plus gN.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So it rotates up.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can play
here and see what

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.180 align:middle line:84%
happens if there is a
change in population growth

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.058 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:49:23.058 --> 00:49:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
counterintuitive initially

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:84%
because you see, if I
increase population growth,

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.280 align:middle line:84%
this curve will
rotate up, and then

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.890 align:middle line:84%
it will appear as if that
leads to negative growth.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.630 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get
negative growth.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:43.505 align:middle line:84%
In this diagram, you do get
that Y over N will decline.

00:49:43.505 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
you get negative growth.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It just means that output is not
growing as fast as population.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But both are growing, just the
population is growing faster

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:90%
than output.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll start from that--

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.750 align:middle line:84%
oh, I think it's
after your break,

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
so when you have forgotten
everything by then.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do a review
of this, and then we--

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, have a nice break.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:90%
