00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: The
main topic in this part

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:90%
is really open economy.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we extended
the IS-LM model.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:90%
We did not bring in--

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
we again shut down
price changes,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
so we said price is
completely fixed.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:90%
No Phillips curve here.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So we expanded the IS-LM
model to add this open economy

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we start from the same
aggregate demand function

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that we had in closed
economy-- consumption

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
plus investment plus
go in expenditure--

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
but now we have to draw a
distinction between demand

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
by domestic households,
companies, and the government,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and the demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And so z is the demand for
domestically-produced goods,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to demand plus
the demand that foreigners have

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
for the goods produced at home
minus the imports, that part

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of that expenditure that
is going to imports.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That means goods produced
by other countries.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the new
behavioral functions

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
here were the export function
and the import function export.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Is increasing in foreign output.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
More income abroad will
lead to more imports

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
by them, which means
more export for home.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.717 align:middle line:84%
And it's decreasing with
respect to the exchange rate.

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Real exchange rate and
nominal exchange rate

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:84%
will be the same here since
we have fully sticky prices.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But if the real exchange
rate appreciates,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that means domestic
goods are more expensive.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It means exports are less.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Foreigners are going to
buy less of our goods.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Conversely for imports,
it's like the exports

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of the other country, means that
if domestic output goes up, then

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
there will be more
purchases of foreign goods.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And if the exchange
rate appreciate,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
means also that foreign
goods are cheaper for us,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and therefore we import more.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:90%
So positive.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So those were the two
new behavioral functions

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
in the goods market expanded
to include an open economy.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And that had implications
for the diagram

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that we had in lecture three
or so to determine equilibrium

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:90%
output.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We started from the same demand
we had in closed economy.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Then we had to subtract imports,
and that shifts things down

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
because now it's part
of the domestic demand

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that is going to foreign
goods, not to domestic goods.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But it also rotates the
curve because the higher

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is domestic income,
the more the imports

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that we do from the
rest of the world.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now to that we have to add
the exports, which are not

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
a function of domestic output.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a parallel shift
with respect to this curve.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:90%
We go up.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us
the zz curve, which

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Now notice that the
distance between the demand

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
for domestically-produced
goods and the domestic demand

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
for goods is the net export, so
the distance between zz and dd

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%
is the net exports.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So this point here,
for example, the zz

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
is higher than dd, which means
that our exports are greater

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
than our imports, and that's the
reason you have a trade surplus.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
At this point they're
the same, and that's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
the reason the trade
account is balanced,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.468 align:middle line:84%
but over here, imports
exceed exports.

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
we have a trade deficit.

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go very quickly, so
you're in charge of stopping me.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
ask you questions.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.415 align:middle line:84%
Just stop me if
there's something

00:03:51.415 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
that you need clarification.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what's the demand
for domestically-produced goods.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
determine equilibrium output

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
in this open economy
context, and that

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
means aggregate demand
has to be equal--

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand for
domestically-produced goods has

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to be equal to output,
and that's what we do with

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
the 45-degree line here.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so where the 45-degree line
intersect with this zz curve,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:90%
that's our equilibrium output.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Now it happens that
in this example,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:90%
that leads to a trade deficit.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is nothing here, so we
still determine the equilibrium

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
output up here, and then we read
in this curve, bottom curve,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
what is the implication for
the trade deficit or surplus.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But the equilibrium
condition, important

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is that
domestically-produced output

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
has to be equal to the demand
for domestically-produced goods.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.315 align:middle line:90%
Not for total demand.

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a Keynesian
model in which output

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:90%
is aggregate demand determined.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
aggregate demand

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
for the things
you're producing, not

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.712 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand for all
goods around the world.

00:04:57.712 --> 00:04:58.212 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:58.212 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:90%
So then we did some experiments.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
We said, suppose what happens
in this open economy context

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
if we increase
government expenditure.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The curve will shift up
in exactly the same way

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%
as in the closed economy.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
The difference will
be in the multiplier

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
though, because
as output goes up

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the expansionary
aggregate demand, that also

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
means that domestic
income will go up,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and that means that
imports will go up,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and thus demand will
go for foreign goods.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason this zz
curve has a lower multiplier.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's flatter than the dd curve.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Still if we start, for
example, with a trade balance,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
since imports are
going to increase

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this
expansionary fiscal policy,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
we're going to end up
with a trade deficit.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
the response of output

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is less than closed economies,
because part of that

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
goes to foreign goods.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if
this other country

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that is doing an expansionary
fiscal policy or something that

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
leads to higher
output abroad, y star,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that's also
expansionary for home

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:84%
because the export
function goes up,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and that leads to an
increase in output,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
still with lower
multiplier because part

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.810 align:middle line:84%
of that increase in domestic
output will go to imports.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
unlike the other ones,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
actually the trade balance
improves because it's

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
being pulled by exports.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And so at impact we
get a big increase

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
in exports, which is
the driver of increase

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
for demand for
domestically-produced goods.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And then as income goes
up, we do some of that,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:90%
but you end up with higher--

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
better trade surpluses
than in the case

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
in which you induce the
expansion in aggregate demand.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Then the last step there was to
look at the role of the exchange

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we said is we're going
to make some assumptions that I

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:84%
promise you, and I
now read the quiz

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
so I guarantee you
all of this promise--

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
nothing weird will
happen, meaning

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
if our goods gets more
expensive, that means

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:90%
that net exports will be worse.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And for two reasons.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
For at least one reason,
but it could be two.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
If the exchange rate
goes up, then there

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to be less
exports at any given

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
level of foreign income.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:90%
That will worsen the net export.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to tend to import more.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that will be partially
offset for the fact

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can buy more with
the same amount of dollars,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
but we said we're going
to impose conditions such

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that the positive--
the negative effect

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of an appreciation on net
exports always dominates.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, in your
quiz you're going

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to have a situation like that,
and that will be the case.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So don't think that we're
trying to trick you or anything.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%
This will hold.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The point of this being that
depreciating your currency,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
making your goods
less expensive will

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
produce a response equivalent
to what you get here

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%
out of an increase in y star.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.173 align:middle line:84%
That's exports will
go up, and you're

00:08:21.173 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:90%
going to get all this shift.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Net export function will go up.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.608 align:middle line:84%
That will increase
aggregate demand and so on.

00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind of
things that countries

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
want to do typically when
they're in a recession

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
Then that was an introduction
to the most important lecture

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in this part of
the course, which

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:90%
is the Mundell-Fleming model.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you that you would
get 70% at least in the quiz,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and I already read the quiz, so
I tell you there is at least 70%

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of your points have
to do with this model,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
so you better
understand it very well.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
You do every single
comparative statics

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can imagine
with this model,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll
get 70% at least.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you get 73%
actually, but that's the--

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
so what's this?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
The Mundell-Fleming model is
simply what I just showed you.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the goods
market equilibrium

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
but with an endogenous
exchange rate.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we rewrote and said,
since we're assuming completely

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.445 align:middle line:84%
sticky prices, we can replace
the real exchange rate

00:09:29.445 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:84%
by the nominal exchange
rate, but now we're

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
going to endogenize
the exchange rate.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And for that we're going to use
the uncovered interest parity

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%
This is a condition you should
understand very well as well.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you essentially
that the expected return

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of the two bonds,
the bonds issued

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
in foreign currency and domestic
currency, have to be the same.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
The expected return
have to be the same.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And this condition ensures
that, because if a country,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:84%
for example, if the
domestic interest

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
rate is higher than the
international interest rate,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
you need to expect
a depreciation

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of the current currency,
otherwise the expected return

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:90%
would not be the same.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
when we add the assumption

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that the expected exchange is
fixed at least temporarily,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.053 align:middle line:84%
then an increase in
the interest rate

00:10:22.053 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
leads to an appreciation
of the exchange rate.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if the exchange
rate appreciates

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but the expected
exchange rate stays put,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that means the expected
appreciation will

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
have to be undone,
and that means

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that leads to an
expected depreciation.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's very important.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So and here you
have therefore you

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
need to understand this,
know that for a given

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
expectation of
the exchange rate,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
an increase in
domestic interest rate

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
appreciates the
domestic currency,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and an increase in the foreign
interest rate without us

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
matching it will lead
to a depreciation

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of the domestic currency.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you have there.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Now notice that if the
expected exchange rate goes up

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and the interest
rates do not change,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
then the current exchange
rate has to go up.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if it didn't, then you
would have an expected capital

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
gain out of the currency
and expected appreciation,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and that would add to
the expected return

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.985 align:middle line:90%
of owning domestic bonds.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So we characterize that interest
parity condition as follows.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
We said, this here, we are
plotting the domestic interest

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Here we're plotting the
current exchange rate.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And we are marking
in this picture--

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
this is a curve
that traces the UIP

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:90%
and coverage by the condition.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And naturally when the
domestic interest rate

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
International interest rate,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
then it has to be the
case that the exchange

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
rate is at the same level as
the expected exchange rate.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
If that is equal to
that, so if we're here,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
then we know that the
point in that curve

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is that in which the exchange
rate is equal to the expected

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:90%
exchange rate.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So you should understand this
curve and know what moves it.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Here it's very clear
what moves it, no?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
There are two things that
can move this curve here.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
One is a change in i
star, the other one

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is a change in
expected exchange rate.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens if
the i star goes up?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You know that the
UIP will shift,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:37.052 align:middle line:84%
but you do know that the
point equivalent to that, that

00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:84%
is one in which exchange rate is
equal to expected exchange rate,

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
will have to have a higher
domestic interest rate.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm
bringing this up and I

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.365 align:middle line:84%
want to still look at
the point in which e

00:12:47.365 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
expected exchange rate,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
then I have to move i
up by the same amount.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that this curve,
when i star goes up, this curve

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%
moves up or to the left.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:90%
You pick which way you analyze.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Now what about the
expected exchange rate?

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
If the expected
exchange rate goes up

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and the international
interest rate hasn't gone up,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
so if the expected
exchange rate moves

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
to the right and the domestic
interest doesn't go up,

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
then that means that
the current exchange

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:90%
rate will have to also go up.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So that means if this goes
up, then at an interest rate

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
equal to the international
interest rate,

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
so let's look in
this direction, then

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
we have a point around here.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.892 align:middle line:84%
If that wasn't
the case, then you

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:84%
would be expecting
an appreciation,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and then again, it would be
inconsistent with the UIP.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Then we put things together.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is we use the
UIP to replace the exchange

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
rate there, and now we get this
expression in the net export

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the LM is exactly
the same as before.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
The central bank sets
the interest rate.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Here I'm writing it in terms
of the nominal interest rate.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I think in the quiz we wrote it
in terms of the real interest

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
rate, but it's the same
because prices are fixed,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
so real and nominal interest
rates are exactly the same.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.973 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is the x axis
the expected exchange rate?

00:14:27.973 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: No.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the actual exchange rate.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The expected exchange rate
is in this curve here.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:90%
That is a parameter.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be a value
of the current exchange

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
equal to the expected
exchange rate, which

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is convenient to plot
because that's also

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.483 align:middle line:84%
when the domestic interest rate,
which is what I'm putting here,

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is equal to international
interest rate.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'm saying.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:54.058 align:middle line:84%
And then if you shift this to
the right, exchange rate up,

00:14:54.058 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the expected exchange
rate up, then I

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
know that a new
point in this curve

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
has to have a higher
current exchange rate.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:90%
So that I know.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.565 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
equivalent to this point

00:15:03.565 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:90%
A is going to be to the right.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
If you lower the foreign
interest rate, then what I know

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is that exactly, that the
point at which exchange rate is

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
equal to the expected
exchange rate

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:84%
has to have a lower
domestic interest rate.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So that means that I
know that this point

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
A will be around here, which
is like a shift to the right.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so as I was saying,
nominal and real interest rates

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.405 align:middle line:84%
I think in the quiz we wrote
r there, but it's the same.

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Same model.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So now you see that interest
rates have two effects.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
One is the traditional
effect, affects investment,

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
but it also affects
the exchange rate.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So an increase in the
domestic interest rate

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
now will be doubly
contractionary in the sense

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that we lower
domestic investment.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
That reduces aggregate demand.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.353 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, it will also

00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the exchange
rate, and therefore it

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:90%
will reduce net exports.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to import
more and export less,

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and that's also going to
reduce aggregate demand.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:90%
So those are the two effects.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's the contribution
of all this exchange rate

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
block to our IS-LM framework.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Mundell-Fleming is simply
IS-LM plus a UIP condition

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and a net export function.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So we put out now the
two things together, sort

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of a standard IS-LM,
now with different slope

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and so on because we have
this net export function

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and we have more parameter, we
have y star, i star, and things

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
like that, and then
we have the UIP there.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we did a
few experiments.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Said suppose that now you have
an expansionary monetary policy.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So an expansionary
monetary policy

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.287 align:middle line:84%
as before with slightly
different slopes

00:16:59.287 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and so on because of
the net export function

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:90%
will lower equilibrium output.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And it will lower
it for two reasons.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.467 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, it will lower
it because investment will

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
decline but also because
higher interest rate

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:84%
means an appreciation
of the exchange rate

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
today because you have to
expect a depreciation now

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:90%
in the next period.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And that means also
less net exports.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So the interest rate
is contractionary

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:90%
for two different reasons here.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that clear?

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.345 align:middle line:90%
Raised interest rate.

00:17:31.345 --> 00:17:34.318 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Raised interest rates will
lower aggregate demand

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
for the standard reason,
but on top of that,

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.703 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get an
appreciation of the exchange

00:17:40.703 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
rate, which also
reduces net exports.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
What about an increase in
government expenditure?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as before,
and nothing changes

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
relative to before
except for the fact

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:90%
that we have a lower multiplier.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.943 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the case
that it's expansionary,

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't affect
the interest rate,

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.027 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't affect the exchange
rate or anything like that.

00:18:02.027 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's less expansionary
than closed economy

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.035 align:middle line:84%
because part of that
energy will go to imports.

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to this diagram,
and I played with this diagram

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
here and said, suppose that the
expected exchange rate goes up,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%
then which curves change?

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And the first one that
changes is this one.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
This one moves to the right, so
you get an appreciation today.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And that also means that
this curve here, that, yes,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:90%
will shift to the left.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
If expected change
goes up and you

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
don't change
monetary policy, that

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:90%
means interest rate will go up.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't change
monetary policy,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.178 align:middle line:84%
that means the current
exchange rate will appreciate.

00:18:44.178 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
That will reduce net
exports, and that's

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%
a shift in this space.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a shift in
the yes to the left.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%
This is a parameter.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
These two things are parameters
now in the IS-LM diagram.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
What about for an
output going down?

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't affect
the UIP condition,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but it does affect net exports,
so that moves IS to the left.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing we did
was an increase in i star.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And an increase in
i star, what it does

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.762 align:middle line:84%
is at the same
interest rate, then

00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
you know that you need a
depreciation of the currency

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
today because that will lead
to an expected appreciation,

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
so that means that
this UIP curve moves

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
to the left and the IS
curve moves to the right.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And increasing the interest rate
taken as given foreign output.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
If foreign output
also changes, then you

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.423 align:middle line:84%
have to look at the
combination of the two things.

00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But taking foreign
output as given,

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:84%
then this curve will
shift to the left

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and that will move
the IS to the right

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because the exchanges
will depreciate.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It said sometimes countries
choose to fix exchange rates.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you fix
an exchange rate,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and if it's a credible
exchange rate,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.038 align:middle line:84%
then the expected exchange is
equal to the actual exchange

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
rate and equal to
some constant, then

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that implies immediately
that the domestic interest

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
rate has to be equal to the
international interest rate.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you fix your exchange
rate to someone else,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
then you give up
your monetary policy.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.893 align:middle line:84%
The monetary policy is run
by a different country.

00:20:16.893 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
important lecture.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Play with it, please.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we look more carefully at
different exchange rate regimes

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and the effectiveness
of policy within each

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
of these regimes, the flexible
exchange rate system, which

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:84%
is the one we were
discussing before, you get

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
sort of-- if a country
is in a recession,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.928 align:middle line:90%
you can use fiscal policy.

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I showed you that before.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It works well.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can also use
expansionary monetary policy,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:84%
which will be very
successful for two reasons.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
One, the traditional one,
but the second reason

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it will
depreciate your currency.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Now then suppose that
you had a country that

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is also in a recession but you
have a fixed exchange rate.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you still can
use fiscal policy.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing against that.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.843 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot use the
expansionary monetary policy.

00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's a limitation
of fixed exchange rate,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that you lose an important tool.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Another problem that can arise
with fixed exchange rates

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is speculative attacks
on the currency.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the peg
is not credible,

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and when the peg is not
credible, you can imagine that--

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
suppose that people expect
your currency to depreciate,

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
so expect the exchange rate goes
down, and suppose that you do

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
want to keep your peg today,
that's what typically happens.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody speculates
against your peg,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
but the central bank
resists that for a while.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But the only way
you can resist that,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
short of closing
the capital account

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and doing all sorts
of things there,

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:84%
but you haven't learned
about those, so don't worry.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
The only tool you have here to
defend the speculative attack

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
on your currency that is
for the exchanging note

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
to depreciate today is by
raising interest rates.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So the defense of an exchange
rate causes a recession at home.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That's another problem that
flexible exchange rate have.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.587 align:middle line:84%
And the deal seems
pretty obvious

00:22:23.587 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to
have a fixed exchange rate.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, be careful
because flexible exchange

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:90%
rates are also not a panacea.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
You may get lots of volatility
in the exchange rate

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because the role of
expectations is very important.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.988 align:middle line:84%
And anyways, this
looks complicated,

00:22:40.988 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's essentially what we
did later on when we price

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
equity and things like that.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We use the same sort of iterated
substitutions and things.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This was just meant to say
that in a flexible exchange

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:84%
rate, once you endogenize
expected exchange rate,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:84%
you don't take it
as a constant, it

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.235 align:middle line:84%
gets to be very complicated
because effectively the exchange

00:22:59.235 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
rate is pinned down
by the expectations

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of infinite horizon of interest
rate at home and abroad.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
space for creativity

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and moving things around.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
exchanges can be very volatile.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, so all that, that
was it for Mundell-Fleming plus.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Any question about that?

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Because now I'm going to
move to the next part.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then the next step
was to look at asset prices

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
really and/or valuations
of assets in general that

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
have cash flows in the
future or an exchange

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:84%
that's a little bit
like that, by the way.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We talk a lot about
current events.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:90%
But the key thing was this.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
We said, OK, many things,
many financial or real assets,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
actually, or even your human
wealth, we'll discuss later on,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.183 align:middle line:84%
you are receiving
some income today,

00:24:02.183 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
but you're also expecting to
receive income in the future.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And this part was about how do
we value those things that we

00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
receive in the
future, those cash

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%
flows that come in the future.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we developed this concept
of a expected present discounted

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:90%
value.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And we said, very natural way
of bringing dollars received

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
in the future to the present is
to discount them by the interest

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:90%
rate between now and then.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason, the
logic behind that

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is because if you
give me $1 today,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I can do a lot more than if you
give me $1 five years from now

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:84%
because I can invest the dollar
today and earn the interest rate

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
return up to five
years from now.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So $1 today is worth a lot more
than $1 five years from now,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
therefore $1 five years from
now is worth a lot less than $1

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:90%
How much less?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
1 over 1 plus the interest rate
over that period, which is--

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Then I show you a
general cash flow.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
This is an asset that gives a
cash flow zt at the beginning

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of this period.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
zt plus 1 at the
beginning of the next one

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
or at the end of this
one, something like that.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
This one you don't
need to discount.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
That one you do need to discount
because you're not receiving it

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
now, you're receiving
it a year from now.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
This one, it's two
years from now.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
You need to discount it more
because it's two years that you

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
could be earning an interest
rate and so on and so forth.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.521 align:middle line:84%
This formula you
need to understand.

00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's if
you know the future.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know the future,
then you just replace the things

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.347 align:middle line:84%
you don't know for
their expected value.

00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what you say.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's the approximation.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:84%
In reality, if you were
to do this formally,

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:90%
it's a little more complicated.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But for this course,
that's all that you do.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at
some particular cases.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:84%
This is a case, the same case,
but one in which the interest

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.308 align:middle line:90%
rate is constant.

00:25:54.308 --> 00:25:56.683 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that you expect the
interest rate to be constant,

00:25:56.683 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
then it's a little
simpler expression,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
because rather than
getting this product of 1

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 the interest
rates at different times,

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:90%
you get just powers of 1 plus i.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Then another one that
is simpler obviously

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is one in which all
these expected payments

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:90%
are constant and so on.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then even simpler, if
the interest rate is constant

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and the payment is constant,
you get some simple formulas

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Simpler formulas.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And then cases in which
asset lives forever

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of that kind and
that's a value, if you

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
don't pay for-- if you don't
receive the first cash flow now

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:84%
but you receive it at the
beginning of next year

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:84%
or at the end of this one, then
it gets even simpler like that.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And you are going to get a
question of this kind in which

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
be asked to compare

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:84%
two different assets that have
different profiles of cash

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
flows, and you're going to have
to compare between those two.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Then we talk about
bonds and bond yields.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And essentially we use expected
present discounted value formula

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:90%
just for bonds.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And bonds have a very particular
form, profile of payment.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.287 align:middle line:84%
Typically some coupons
and some final payment,

00:27:07.287 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
which we call it the face
value of the bond or something

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And we said a very important
concept in bonds is maturity.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And maturity is the
date, the number of years

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.763 align:middle line:84%
till the last
payment on that bond.

00:27:21.763 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter
whether you receive

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
lots of little
coupons along the way.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And one final payment,
whether you receive no payment

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever until the last
day, that doesn't matter.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
The maturity of a bond is
the date, the number of years

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
till the last time,
your last payment.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:90%
So we give some examples.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a bond that pays nothing
now but pays $100 one year

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Has a price.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a discounted value of
$100 for one year divided

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
by 1 plus the one year
interest rate at time t.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:84%
A bond that pays
nothing up to two years

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and then after two
years pays $100,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
then that's the value,
the price of that bond.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.450 align:middle line:90%
It's $100 discounted by that.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we look
at arbitrage, which

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
says suppose you hold a
bond that you're considering

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:84%
investing your money for one
year, but you have two options.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:90%
One is to buy a one-year bond.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The alternative is to buy a
two-year bond now and sell it

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the year.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Those two strategies should
give you more or less

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:90%
the same return.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you buy
a one-year bond,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get 1 plus
i1t at the end of the year.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
If you go through the
two-year bond strategy,

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to pay this today

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
but you expect to receive the
price of a one-year bond one

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%
year from now.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And we said these two
things have to be equal.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%
More or less equal.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're not adding
risk to these things.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
If there's no risk consideration
of agents at risk neutral,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
then these two things
have to be equal.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
That allows you to solve for
the price of a two-year bond

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
as expected price of a
one-year bond one year

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
from now divided by 1
plus the interest rate,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
but the expected price of a
one-year bond one year from now

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to be like a one-year
bond but one year from now,

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
so it's 100 divided by 1 plus
i1t plus 1 expected value.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I can stick that in there, and I
get exactly the same expression.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So these are two different
ways of pricing a bond

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:90%
or any other asset actually.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we define
the yield to maturity.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's an important concept.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Yield to maturity is a
constant rate that gives you

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:90%
the current price of the bond.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So we already determined
the price of a two-year bond

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:90%
is that.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm saying,
suppose that-- let

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:84%
me look for a rate that is
the same in both periods that

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:90%
gives me the same price.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason I have
a subscript 2 here at time t.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So what is the rate that, if I
put a constant rate, so I have

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
1 plus i2t times 1
plus i2t gives me

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.605 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same price as the
one we already determined.

00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the yield to maturity

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:90%
or the yield or the end--

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.500 align:middle line:84%
in this case, would
be a two-year rate.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If you hear, what is a
two-year rate, it's that.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we know what this price
is, which is equal to that,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:90%
thus this expression there.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So the whole trick here is
to find the two-year rate

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
at time t that gives you
exactly the same value.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:84%
That means obviously
since 100 is equal to 100,

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it means to find the i to t that
gives you this equal to that.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you say it's
approximate, implies

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that approximately
a two-year rate

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is like an average of
the two one-year rates.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But this concept, you
should know what it is.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I said there are two
forms of risk in a bond.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.822 align:middle line:84%
One type of risk
is the full risk.

00:31:24.822 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
What if the issuer of
the bond doesn't pay you?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a huge issue
with the US debt ceiling,

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:84%
because if somehow
they don't fix that,

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
there will be a default
on some treasury bonds.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope that
it doesn't happen.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But that's default
risk, is that whoever

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:84%
issued the debt, at the time in
which it should be paying you

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
a coupon or the principal, the
face value, it doesn't pay you.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%
That's default risk.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And typically, US Treasury
bonds don't have that risk,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:90%
so nobody worries about that.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, the
default risk price

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:84%
in US bonds for one-month bonds
is higher than that of Mexico

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and the bonds in
Mexico or Brazil.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
That tells you the
kind of things we have.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, so this
is a temporary default risk.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Nobody expects in the
US that this will not

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:90%
be eventually repaid.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can cause a big mess by
just delaying a coupon payment

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:90%
when these coupons are huge.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what's
leading to all this concern.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
that's one type of risk.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't look at
that type of risk a lot.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Corporate bonds have
a lot of that risk,

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't look
at that kind of risk.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
We looked at another kind of
risk, which is price risk.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
If you invest in your one-year
bond, there is no price risk,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get your
coupon, your face value of $100

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the year.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.875 align:middle line:84%
If you go through a
two-year strategy,

00:32:53.875 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:84%
there is a risk
there because you

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
don't know exactly what the
price of the one-year bond

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:84%
will be one year from now,
and that's a risk there.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
We are not looking at what
risk-averse investors do and so

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:84%
on, but in reality,
there is such a risk.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And just the way we model
that is we said, then

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to go
through the two-year bond

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.680 align:middle line:84%
route for a one-year
investment, then I

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:84%
don't have to set this
equal to the return

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I get in the short
bond, the one-year bond.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I have to add an
extra risk premium.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we write to this
formula using the same steps.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We said, well the
two-year rate is really

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
the average of the expected
one-year rate plus a premium.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And we call that actually
the term premium.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely
to face a question

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
about the top of the slide
than the bottom of the slide,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
but I don't remember fully.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Stock prices and present value.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It's the same sort of idea.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that the
equities do not have maturity.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Stocks do not have maturity.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:84%
In principle, a company
would last forever.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And so there is no maturity.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is also the
commitment of-- the coupons

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.656 align:middle line:84%
are a lot shakier in the sense
that, yeah, the company is

00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:84%
likely to give dividends,
they may announce the dividend

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:84%
policy, but it's
not a commitment.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Regional banks now are
not giving any dividend

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
preserve the capital.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:84%
They could, but they're
not because they

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
want to build capital
just to be more

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:84%
resilient to any
further bad news.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so equity,
that means that you always

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
have this future
price floating around,

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and you can keep substituting
this multiple times.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, you get to
an expression that says, look,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
the price of equity is really
the expected present discounted

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:56.973 align:middle line:84%
value of the dividends, and that
includes lots of uncertainty

00:34:56.973 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know exactly
what the interest rate will

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:90%
be in that period and so on.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is always a
remaining term out there which

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:90%
also causes a lot of trouble.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
In practice, assets,
equities move a lot more

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
than what you can justify with
respect to the present value

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:90%
of dividends.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of volatility.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:90%
There are bubbles.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:90%
There are all sorts of things.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I told you the story
of Newton and so on.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So this formula for the bonds,
those formulas are great.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:84%
For equity you're going to be
pretty far off on actual prices

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:90%
if you use this type of formula.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Still people call this the
fundamental value of equity.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest is
sort of more speculative.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
the speculative component

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:90%
moves a lot.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible for a very
large share of the volatility

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.547 align:middle line:90%
in asset-- in equity prices.

00:35:50.547 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
In any event, I'm
not going to ask you

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:90%
about this kind of stuff.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So that final
equation on the slide,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.172 align:middle line:90%
there is no expression for qt.

00:36:00.172 --> 00:36:01.630 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
It's right here.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.338 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:36:02.338 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: It
keeps going forever.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It just discounted
more and more and more,

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
so you would expect it to
be less and less important.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But if the thing is
blowing up, then it

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
may dominate the heavier
and heavier discounting

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's further
out in the future.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way you
create theories of bubbles.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You can even come up with
rational bubbles in that way,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.280 align:middle line:84%
but again, that's for
a different course.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.893 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:36:31.893 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at
what is the effect

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:84%
of an expansionary monetary
policy on asset prices.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.522 align:middle line:84%
And we said, obviously
it's going to,

00:36:37.522 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:84%
if you lower interest
rates, that's

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:84%
going to increase the
value of any asset that

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:90%
pays in the future returns.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it is typically
the case that

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
expansionary
monetary policy will

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.030 align:middle line:84%
lead to an appreciation
of all assets.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Most assets, but certainly
bonds will go up directly

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the interest rate has

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
a maximum, the clearest
effect, but it's also the case

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that it tends to be
bullish for equity as well.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It's got interest rate.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the response
of equity to news

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
expected behavior

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.243 align:middle line:90%
of the fed in the future.

00:37:13.243 --> 00:37:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that this will lead
them to increase interest rates

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or to lower interest rates
and things of that kind.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think that's a
little too complicated for you

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:90%
for now.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It said, what is the effect
of an increase in consumer

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:90%
spending on asset prices?

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, that depends.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that if consumers
become more bullish,

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that's going to tend to lead to
more cash flows for the firms,

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:90%
so equity at least will go up.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Bonds no, because the
coupon is set, fixed,

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
doesn't depend on
whether the economy

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:90%
is doing better or worse.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming there
is no default risk.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But it depends a lot of what
you expect the fed to do.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
If you think that this is
going to trigger a fed hike,

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
then it's bad news for bonds
because the bonds do not

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:84%
benefit from the extra
economic activity,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and they get hurt by
higher interest rates.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So it depends a lot on what you
anticipate the fed to do or not.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think this
is a bit more complicated

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:90%
than what you need to know.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, the last step was
to bring expectations

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:90%
into the IS-LM model.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I said the model we discussed
through the course on the IS-LM

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:84%
except for the part where we
put the exchange rate, where

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we had to think about
the future exchange rates

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It really overweighed
the present.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In reality, expectations matter
a lot for consumers' decisions,

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.302 align:middle line:90%
for firms' decisions, and so on.

00:38:36.302 --> 00:38:38.885 align:middle line:84%
Probably matters even more than
the future-- than the present.

00:38:38.885 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did is we
expanded the IS-LM to include

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:84%
expectations, which is where
consumers not only worry about

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.710 align:middle line:90%
disposable income--

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.420 align:middle line:84%
this part will show
up in your test,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.680 align:middle line:84%
so you should understand
what the IS-LM model is

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and do the comparative statics
that corresponds to this model.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we did here, it
says, consumers not only

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:84%
worry about the current
disposable income,

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:84%
they also worry about the income
they receive in the future

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:84%
through financial
assets, financial wealth,

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
or through their
future labor income.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
call human wealth.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that expectations

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
about the future
matter for consumption.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:84%
In the first part of the
course we summarize all that

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in that little parameter c0.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
We said consumers can
be bullish or not.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what
happens here is what

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.180 align:middle line:84%
shifts c0 in the first
part of the course.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And this also highlights
an important concept,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.970 align:middle line:84%
which is typically if
you expect something

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to have only a temporary
transitory consequence,

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
it will move consumption little
relative to when you expect

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that change to be permanent.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So you expect current
income to be up,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.370 align:middle line:84%
but future income to
go back to a lower

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:84%
level, that's not
going to change

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:90%
current consumption a lot.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.243 align:middle line:84%
However, if you think
there is a change that

00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
will increase consumers
income permanently up,

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
well that will increase not
only this but also human wealth,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and that will lead to a much
larger response of consumption.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We did more or less the
same for investment.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Obviously what matters for
investment is future cash flows.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And there we talk about the
concept of depreciation.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But really was this
expected present discounted

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.690 align:middle line:84%
value of the cash flow generated
by an extra unit of capital.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So expected present
discounted value formula.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So in the first
part of the course,

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.285 align:middle line:84%
we just look at an investment
function that has output here,

00:40:38.285 --> 00:40:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and then we have an
interest rate here,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.118 align:middle line:84%
where now we have something
that is more complicated.

00:40:42.118 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It has future output, which as
a proxy for future cash flows

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
but also current
and future interest

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:84%
rates because those affect
the value of those future cash

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:84%
flows in terms of
today's dollars.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And we put all of this
together, and we ended up

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
with an expanded aggregate
demand in which we

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
had the same
parameters as we had

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:84%
when we did the static
model without expectations,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:84%
but now we get sort
of the same things

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:84%
repeated here one year
ahead because it matters

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
not only for
aggregate demand, not

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
only the income that
consumers are receiving today

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:25.560 align:middle line:84%
or the sales that
firms are making today,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
but also what they
expect to have next year.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It matters what the taxes
they are paying today

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:84%
but also what they expect
to pay in the future.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.648 align:middle line:84%
The interest rate
matters not only today

00:41:35.648 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
but also what they
expect the interest rate

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to be in the future and so on.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is that if we
now look at the IS-LM model, now

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:90%
we have lots of more parameters.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:84%
All these things that happen in
the future are new parameters.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I said notice that also this
curve now is a lot steeper.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.437 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:41:58.437 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Well because if you change
the interest rate today

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:84%
without changing the
interest rate in the future,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:90%
then that has a small effect.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I said now this
IS becomes very steep,

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but the equivalent to what
we did in the static model

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is a situation where you cut
the interest rate today-- say

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the central bank cuts
the interest rate today,

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.030 align:middle line:84%
but it also convinces the
public that it will also

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:84%
keep the interest rate
low in the next period.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.220 align:middle line:84%
That is not only you move
along these [INAUDIBLE],,

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
but you also persuade the
public that the interest

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:84%
rate will be lower
in the future, that

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:90%
will shift IS to the right.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And then therefore you're going
to get a much larger kick out

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:90%
of monetary policy.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And monetary policy is a
lot about forward guidance.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It's that you cut interest rates
today, but you're also telling,

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:84%
there is always a speech after
they take the policy action

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.160 align:middle line:84%
which they talk about how
they see interest rates going

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:90%
in the future and that.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
That's because you want
to have maximum power.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.013 align:middle line:84%
If you just tell
the markets, I'm

00:42:58.013 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
going to change the interest
rate for now and then nothing

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
else, that's going to have
a very limited impact.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.070 align:middle line:84%
To have a large impact
out of monetary policy,

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to convince
them that you will also

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:84%
affect the interest
rate path in the future.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Same sort of situation here.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The other parameters is what
happens if, for example, you

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:90%
expect future output to go up.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
That's going to shift
IS to the right.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.990 align:middle line:84%
That's yet another reason why
convincing people that you're

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
going to cut interest
rates in the future

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.745 align:middle line:84%
as well, that you're
going to keep them

00:43:28.745 --> 00:43:31.077 align:middle line:84%
low in the future
shift IS even more,

00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because if you're going
to keep the interest

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:84%
rate low in the future,
that means probably

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that future output
will be higher.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And since future
output is higher,

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that increases human
wealth, and that means

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:90%
consumption will tend to go up.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
But do play with this.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
important to have

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:84%
this distinction between the
impact of temporary things,

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
which is much smaller,
and the impact

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of permanent things,
which is bigger

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.005 align:middle line:90%
because it affects wealth.

00:43:58.005 --> 00:44:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's an example.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy,
again, that's

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
just if you don't
persuade the public

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to change the
interest rate in the future,

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
then it just a movement along,
but if you also convince them

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that you remain sort of loose
monetary conditions next year,

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:84%
then that effectively shifts the
IS to the right for a variety

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, for two
reasons at least,

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's much
more expansionary.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The last thing we
need is fiscal policy.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I said fiscal policy
today is contractionary.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:90%
There is no doubt of that.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are episodes,
and I show you

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the Irish episode, in
which actually may end up

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.070 align:middle line:84%
going the other way
around, in which you

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
cut expenditure today,
which is contractionary,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but you end up actually
having an expansion.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But for that, the only
way that can happen

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is that if somehow you
affect expectations

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:90%
in a very significant way.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I said.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:03.140 align:middle line:84%
If you ever get sort of a
strange correlate response

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to a policy announcement,
it's probably

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.000 align:middle line:84%
because there has been a
big effect on expectations.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So I showed you
the case of Ireland

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because there's a case
that was famous in which

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.080 align:middle line:84%
all the people talk about there
was a fiscal deficit-- that it's

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a big drag in the
economy, that it was going

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to be a big day of reckoning and
that, and so on and so forth.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So once they dealt with
it, sort of expectations,

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
they realized that they could
cut interest rates then,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
they could realize that also
that this malaise in the economy

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.690 align:middle line:84%
was going to go away, so
people became optimistic

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.620 align:middle line:84%
about the future and so on, and
they end up with an expansion.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:84%
That shows you how
important expectations are.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So economic policy in general,
the direct immediate effect

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is what we have been discussing
throughout the course,

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:53.400 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of its power and even
the sort of perverse or good

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.080 align:middle line:84%
synergies that you
get out of them

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what you
do with expectations.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:12.000 align:middle line:90%
