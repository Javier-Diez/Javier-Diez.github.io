RICARDO CABALLERO:
But before I do

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that, before I get
into the IS-LM model,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
let me spend a little time
telling you what is going on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
in the US economy, as this will
relate to the kind of things

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that we'll discuss
later in this lecture.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So what you see there is the
path of net worth, so wealth,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
essentially, of households
and nonprofit organizations,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:90%
households primarily in the US.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And what you can see is that
there is a more or less steady

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:90%
trend.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in recessions,
net wealth tends to decline.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, early on
in the COVID recession,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
it declined very dramatically,
because the price of equity,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
the price of houses, everything
declined with the initial shock.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But what you see after that
is a dramatic rise in wealth

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
in the US, and all around
the world, but particularly,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And what is behind
that, well, there

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
are two things that
are behind that,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
but the main one
is asset prices.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You have massive rallies
in the equity market.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The price of houses
sort of skyrocketed

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:90%
everywhere, and so on.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Last year, 2022, was a
bad year for asset values.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The equity market declined
pretty sharply in the US.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But still, I mean,
it's a small decline

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
relative to the big
buildup of wealth.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you think
that, in this course,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I would be talking about
this at this point?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in this
part of the course,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to come up with
a model of aggregate demand,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and then, how aggregate
demand reacts to policy.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the name of the game
in this part of the course.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So if I tell you that
wealth increases a lot,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
why do you think I'm
telling you that?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Aggregate demand.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.998 align:middle line:90%
Consumers will reach.

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:90%
They will tend to consume more.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
That will increase
aggregate demand.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So the point I'm
highlighting to here

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a big
force behind increasing

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand, which
is consumers feel richer.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
By the way, something similar
is happening in corporations,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and investment is
also pretty high

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
because of that,
real investment.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The other source of
increasing wealth,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
which is not as dramatic
as the previous one,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's very important,
especially in lower income

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
segments of the population which
tend to have a higher propensity

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to consume is that incomes did
not decline a lot during COVID.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
they even increased

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:84%
because of the large transfers
that we saw from the government

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to individual households,
especially lower income

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:90%
households.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there
wasn't much to spend on.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So that meant that
the saving rate also

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
went up a lot in the US
during the COVID recession.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So people save a lot more.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of the average
saving, household savings.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:90%
This is by quarter, I think.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:90%
No, monthly.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we
saw in the past.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Look at during the
COVID recession.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.592 align:middle line:90%
People save a lot more.

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And what you're seeing today is,
obviously, they save a lot more.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the increase
in net worth is due to this.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's small relative
to the amount

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of wealth we saw increase.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But this was about-- this excess
saving amounted to about $2.7,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.325 align:middle line:90%
$2.8 trillion.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So you get a sense of
the order of magnitude.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening now is
what people are desaving so now

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
people are saving
less than they used to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
because now, they
have opportunity

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:90%
to spend the stuff on.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where you see
massive demand for travel,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
massive demand for restaurants,
hotels, and stuff like that.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that has a lot to do with
people have the money to do it.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been able
to do it for a while.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, they're
doing a lot of that.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.055 align:middle line:84%
Why would I be telling you
this now in the course,

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the course?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
For the same reason I told
you that net worth went a lot.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people had the
savings, and they're really

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
willing to spend it.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That puts lots of upward
pressure on aggregate demand.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
These pictures capture
more or less the same.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
This captures very much what
I said in the previous slide.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You see the personal
saving rate.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the average.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.464 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember, over--

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, seven-year average.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see what
happened during COVID.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Big spike in the savings
rate, and now, big decline

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
in the saving rate,
where saving rate is much

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:90%
lower than what normally is.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the saving
rate is your income

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:90%
minus your consumption.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saving
less, you're consuming

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
more relative to your income.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there is
lots of heterogeneity.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people made a lot
of money, some people

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
didn't make a lot of
money during COVID.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people save a lot, some
people didn't save a lot.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we do know that
on the lower income segments,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the excess
saving is already gone.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it accumulated early
on, but they spent it also

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.413 align:middle line:90%
much earlier.

00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But what you're beginning to
see in some of those segments

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
is even though they don't
have access savings,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:90%
they're borrowing a lot.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, you see
credit card borrowing,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
which had declined a lot, and
now, has increased quite a bit.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, what
do you borrow for?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, for consumption.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So that also funds
additional consumption.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So for all these
reasons, at this moment,

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:84%
the US economy, and many
economies around the world,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
are what we call overheating.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of demand
for the production,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
that capacity of the economy.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.813 align:middle line:84%
And that translates--
the problem,

00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
say, well, what's
wrong with that?

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem is,
something you don't understand

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
at this part of the
course, you understand

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
a model for, but you

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
will have six lectures,
more or less, from now is

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:90%
that leads to high inflation.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that,
but intuition tells you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's a lot of demand
relative to supply.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, prices tend to go up.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That happens in micro, and
it also happens in macro.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:90%
We'll learn that later.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
as a result of this,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the US economy is overheating,
and therefore, monetary policy

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%
has been very contractionary.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The Fed has been
tightening interest rate

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:90%
to cool down the economy.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So how does that happen?

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the kind
of things that we can

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:90%
answer with the IS-LM model.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:90%
So the Fed is very IS-LM like.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
way they think.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:90%
The model is richer.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They have more
equations, and so on.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But they are thinking in
terms of the mechanism

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to
summarize in the IS-LM model.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an economy
that has this problem,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and you are in the central bank,
you need to use monetary policy.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, to understand
how the thing works,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:90%
you need the IS-LM model.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a starting point.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Then you can add
bells and whistles.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But your starting point is
the model we're about to see.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what you see
is what I was saying,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is that all that wealth,
all that excess saving,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
all that pent up demand, if
you will, led to lots of--

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
led to a very--

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:90%
an economy that's overheating.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
here what happened.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I disentangled between
consumption of goods

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:90%
and consumption of services.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.438 align:middle line:84%
Consumption of service is
about 2/3 of consumption.

00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we talked about that.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:90%
And goods is about 1/3.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the
scales are different.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:90%
This is for goods.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
That's for services.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But what you see here
is that was a trend.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So consumption in services
was growing at a steady pace,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.568 align:middle line:90%
then COVID came and collapsed.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't go to a
restaurant, you couldn't travel,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.985 align:middle line:90%
couldn't do anything.

00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So consumption in
services collapsed.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:90%
And now, it has been recovering.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And that recovery picked up
pace last year, actually,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
in 2021, already picked
up pace, and by now, we're

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:90%
above the trend.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So service consumption that
collapsed during COVID now

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:90%
has fully recovered.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
While, at the same
time, the capacity

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.977 align:middle line:84%
to produce in the service
sector hasn't recovered equally.

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But we'll get to
that after quiz 1.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
goods consumption?

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Also initially collapsed,
but then, well, people

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%
were bored at home.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.882 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do anything.

00:08:42.882 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
They bought lots of gadgets
and stuff like that.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So goods consumption went up
very sharply during COVID,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:90%
way above the trend, you see?

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
There is COVID collapse,
and then, people

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
began to buy all
sorts of gadgets.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's slowing down.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But still, if you look relative
to trend, consumption of goods

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
is way above what
it would have been

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:90%
in the absence of this episode.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So the sum of the
two things tells you

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that you have an economy
with a lot of consumption.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And that, at this moment,
the Fed wants to cool down.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It's too much for
the economy to take.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed wants
to cool it down.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see how you do that.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, let's get
into this set of lectures.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And please, stop me if there's
anything that is unclear,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.675 align:middle line:84%
because as I said, this is
probably-- if I hear over

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the summer you have forgotten
everything you have learned

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
in this course, but you remember
these two lectures well,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.395 align:middle line:90%
I'll be happy.

00:09:37.395 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
So stop me if you do.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, normally, I have
taught this lecture in one.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.942 align:middle line:84%
I decided to try to slow
it down as much as I can

00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I
think it's particularly

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
important for this course, and
for your stock of knowledge.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So one of the main
things we're going

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do with this
model, as I've been saying,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
be able to discuss

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
the main macroeconomic
policy tools, which

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:90%
are monetary policy--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
monetary policy is main
anti-cyclical tool,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
but we're also going to be able
to understand fiscal policy.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And fiscal policy is not exactly
equivalent to monetary policy.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It works through
the mechanism that

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.298 align:middle line:84%
allows you to do things
that are more targeted,

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
transfer resources to a specific
group of people, and so on.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes monetary
policy is just not enough.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And the COVID-19
initial recession

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
was clearly a case of that,
and you had to go all in,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see what we did there.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty dramatic
as an intervention.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The COVID-19 recession
led probably to what-- no,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:90%
not probably.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Surely to the largest combined
package in history of policy

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.435 align:middle line:84%
support in terms of monetary
policy and fiscal policy.

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:59.108 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
After these two
lectures you're going

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to get to understand essentially
the joint determination

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of output and interest rate, and
we're going to be able to study,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
as I said before, the impact
of monetary and fiscal policy.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And this framework
that we're going

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:84%
to use to develop,
to study this is

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
what Hicks and Hansen initially
called the IS-LM model.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I already hinted
that this was coming,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:90%
but why do you think the name?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.267 align:middle line:84%
I notice that you
separate IS from LM.

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember what we're
trying to do here.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to look at the
joint determination of output

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:90%
and interest rate.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
That is, we're
trying to determine

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
at the joint
equilibrium of goods

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.875 align:middle line:90%
markets and financial markets.

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.592 align:middle line:84%
When we describe the
equilibrium in the goods market,

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we said there is an alternative
way of describing it.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said as an
investment equal to savings--

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.423 align:middle line:84%
I equal to S. So the
IS part of the name

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
comes from the part that has to
do with equilibrium in the goods

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
IS-- investment
equal to savings.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And the LM part has
to do-- remember,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
L was that component
of aggregate demand

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:90%
we had in the financial markets.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We look at equilibrium as
aggregate demand-- sorry,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
demand for money equal
to supply of money.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Supply of money was M. Demand
for money was y times L of I,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and therefore the LM part.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a mnemonic for why this
model is called the IS-LM.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
IS stands for the part that
has to do with the equilibrium

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
LM has to do with
the part that has

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to do with the equilibrium
in financial markets.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
This model is a model that
combines those two equilibrium.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be interested
in points in which both markets

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
are in equilibrium.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the name
of the game here.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's first develop
the IS relation.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And the IS relation is really
going back to lecture three.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
back to lecture three,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
use the same model we used in
lecture three with one change.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:90%
And that change is--

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
remember in lecture three, we
worked a lot on our consumption.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The only endogenous--
the only function

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
we had was a consumption
function, remember?

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And then all the rest we
took as given-- government

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
expenditure was given,
investment was given.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:90%
All that was given.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to relax
one of those here,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to flesh out
a little more this investment

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
here, make it closer to what
a realistic function is.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Not a constant, obviously.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not totally exogenous to
equilibrium output and so on.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we do know
that real investment,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
this physical investment--
remember, what is this I?

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:90%
It's investment.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.243 align:middle line:84%
This is purchase of
goods and services

00:14:00.243 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
by firms for the purpose
of building capital--

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
equipment, structures,
and stuff like that.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I saw in Piazza-- very
quickly, I'm not into that,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
but I see more or
less the flow--

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that somebody asked,
"should bonds be included

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:90%
in investment?"

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
What is the answer?

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:90%
In that investment.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Should purchase of bonds be
included in that investment?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
This is purchase of goods
and services by firms, no?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.255 align:middle line:84%
Capital, machines,
stuff like that.

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, it's
a financial investment.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to do
with the goods market.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.963 align:middle line:84%
It's something that has to
do with the financial market,

00:14:45.963 --> 00:14:48.647 align:middle line:84%
not with the goods
market equilibrium.

00:14:48.647 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So that investment
is real investment.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, purchase of
capital, buildings

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of production
and stuff like that.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And this investment is a
function of two things at least.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:90%
The first one is activity.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
When output is high,
sales are high,

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:90%
companies tend to invest more.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
They buy more equipment, they
buy more buildings, they expand.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So investment is an increasing
function of output very much

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
like consumption, remember, was
an increasing function of output

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
because income is
increasing in output

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was an increasing
function of output.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So these, we already had seen
functions that looked like that,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and we already know what it
does to aggregate demand.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It makes that curve
steeper, remember?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
multiplier behind that.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Investment gives you
something similar there.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But there is a second
component which

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is also present in
consumption but is not

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
as important as for investment,
which is the interest rate.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
In particular, when the
interest rate goes up

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
for any given level
of income or output,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:90%
then investment goes down.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.875 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's the case?

00:15:56.875 --> 00:16:01.026 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.948 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Yes.

00:16:02.948 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of investment is
funded with borrowing,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and borrowing becomes more
expensive so you don't do it.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't
need to borrow,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
there's an opportunity
cost of those funds.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to build
machines to produce

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or you can do something else
like have an investment,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
financial investment.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So whether you borrow or not,
if still the interest rate

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is higher, the opportunity costs
of building factories is higher.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
reason investment

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
is decreasing with respect
to the interest rate.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.465 align:middle line:84%
So now we go back
to our equilibrium

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
in the goods market, which we
said production is whatever

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:90%
aggregate demand wants.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So output is going to be
equal to aggregate demand.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Aggregate demand is the same
old aggregate demand we had,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
except that now we flesh out
what is inside that investment

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
function there, which we have
another function is increasing

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
output like consumption
was, but we also

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
have something that is
decreasing in the interest rate.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what we
call the IS relation.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the IS relation therefore
has all the combinations

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of output and interest rate that
are consistent with equilibrium

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what I said.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I said the IS relation or IS
curve has all the combinations

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of output and interest rate that
are consistent with equilibrium

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.760 align:middle line:90%
What about lecture three?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
We already had that, but
interest rate played no role,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:90%
so we found one point.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We said there is
one level of output

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.775 align:middle line:84%
which is consistent with
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what we found.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Now since we have an
interest rate there,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
we have two variables
for one curve,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.315 align:middle line:84%
so we can trace a curve,
which is not only one point.

00:17:55.315 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.865 align:middle line:90%
We can trace a curve.

00:17:59.865 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call the IS relation.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So I remember I told you when
we look at the goods market

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium,
remember this diagram

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to
come back to it many times.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.783 align:middle line:90%
And there you are.

00:18:17.783 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So remember when we look at the
equilibrium in the goods market,

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:90%
we had something like that.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just making it curve
rather than linear simply

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't specified the
functional form of investment,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't matter, really.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Make it linear.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.367 align:middle line:84%
But remember, that's the
way we found equilibrium

00:18:32.367 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
We have an aggregate demand,
and it was increasing.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The slope was positive because
we had a marginal propensity

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:90%
to consume.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason this was
not flat, but upward sloping.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And we found equilibrium
output that way.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is lecture three.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
We're back in lecture three
here but with two things,

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:90%
two differences.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
that this ZZ curve

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
relative to the one we
had in lecture three

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:90%
is a little steeper.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that it's a little
steeper than that-- by steeper,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean if income goes up,
then aggregate demand goes up

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.235 align:middle line:90%
by more than it used to go up.

00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:25.652 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it
because investment

00:19:25.652 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
is also not [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly,
because what made it upward

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:84%
sloping before was the
marginal propensity to consume.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But now there is also a
marginal propensity to invest,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
which is also
positive, and that's

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
the reason it's
a little steeper.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
More interesting for this
part of the lecture, though,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
for the construction
of the IS curve

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a parameter
that we have there in ZZ.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
What are the parameters we
had before in that curve?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We had things like government
expenditure, taxes,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:90%
the autonomous consumption.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
stuff that we had

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:90%
as parameters of that ZZ curve.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
By parameters I mean if we
change those parameters,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:90%
we shift that curve.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this particular ZZ
we have an extra parameter,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:90%
which is a very interesting.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It's there, I think.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the interest rate.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
That curve holds for
some given interest rate.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
If I move the interest rate, I'm
going to move this curve around.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the parameters
there, the star

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
parameter I would say for this
minute of the lecture, at least

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
for this moment in the
lecture, is the interest rate.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I can find an equilibrium
because I couldn't

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.167 align:middle line:84%
find an equilibrium
in the goods market

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:84%
if you don't tell
me what the interest

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.403 align:middle line:90%
rate is, because it's a curve.

00:20:49.403 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you, it's
a relationship, the curve.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So if I tell you what
the interest rate is,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
then you can find the
equilibrium in the goods market

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.355 align:middle line:90%
because you can fix this curve.

00:20:58.355 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
That's for one
given interest rate.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.192 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:07.192 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Those of you that are awake,
you understand it or not?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone is in
the same page here.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.985 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.985 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do next
is construct the IS curve.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And how are we
going to-- remember,

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
what I want to try
to do is constructing

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:84%
the space of interest
rate and output, a curve,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
call the IS curve.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a
point in that curve,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
because for one level
of interest rate

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I found the equilibrium output.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So to construct the
curve, what I need to do

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
is start moving
the interest rate

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and see how the
equilibrium output changes,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and that will trace a curve.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be my
IS curve or relationship.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the construction
of the IS curve.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the previous
chart we found point A,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:90%
So point A there is that point.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:90%
There we are.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We had some interest rate.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
This interest rate.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, that was a
parameter of the ZZ curve

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I showed you before.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Gave us equilibrium output A.
So that's a point in the IS

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
because that's a combination
of interest rate and output,

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
which is consistent with the
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a point in the IS.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the definition of IS.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So now what I'm going
to do to construct my IS

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, let me move
the interest rate.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me raise interest
rate from I to I prime.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's an increase
in the interest rate.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And now let me find what is the
new equilibrium in the goods

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
market for a given interest rate
which is higher than the one

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I used to have.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
That amounts to shifting
the ZZ curve down.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Why does increasing
the interest rate

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.893 align:middle line:84%
shift the ZZ curve down,
the aggregate demand down?

00:23:06.893 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because it
makes borrowing lifetime.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
It makes investment.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:90%
The client-- exactly.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Borrowers will expect,
therefore investment declines.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So that means for any
given level of output,

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
now aggregate demand is lower
because investment is lower.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the
multiplier to do its trick,

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you end up
with a decline in output

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.028 align:middle line:84%
which is even larger than the
initial decline in investment

00:23:29.028 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the increase
in the interest rate.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what a multiplier does.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So say interest rate
increased by 100 basis points.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
That reduces investment
by, say, $10 billion,

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and equilibrium output ends
up falling by $15 billion

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the
multiplier and so on.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But the point is after I do all
my convergence to this new lower

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium level of output,
I have a second point

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
in my IS curve, because that's
a combination of a new interest

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:84%
rate, I prime, an output that is
consistent with the equilibrium

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.795 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that it's
consistent with equilibrium

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.753 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market?

00:24:07.753 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm there.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm crossing.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
45-degree line, that means
output equal to aggregate

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
demand.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.855 align:middle line:84%
That's equilibrium
in the goods market.

00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.533 align:middle line:84%
And of course you can keep
going and trace an entire curve.

00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And all that you'll do is
you'll change the interest rate.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.075 align:middle line:90%
That will shift this curve.

00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:32.298 align:middle line:84%
Then you do the multiplier and
end up with a new equilibrium,

00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:33.965 align:middle line:84%
and that's another
point for your curve.

00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:36.815 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.815 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So is it clear how we
constructed that curve?

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It's also very important
to understand--

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.255 align:middle line:90%
so why is it downward sloping?

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.005 align:middle line:90%
That's a question.

00:24:51.005 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.465 align:middle line:90%
Why is it downward sloping?

00:24:57.465 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean that
it's downward sloping?

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
That means that the combination
of output and interest rate

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent when
equilibrium output are

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
negatively correlated,
meaning I have

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
a combination of high output
and low interest rate--

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it's consistent with
[INAUDIBLE],, or high interest

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%
rate and low output.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what I find here.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:90%
But why is that?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the logic
of behind that?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Or the mechanism.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
The way to think
about that is exactly

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:90%
the way I did this experiment.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's to say, let me think
what happens if I increase

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate and I keep the
level of output where it was.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if I
increase the interest rate

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and I keep the level of
output at the level it was?

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
My claim is that that's not an
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying suppose I
increase the interest rate

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:90%
but I keep the output constant.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So output is here,
higher interest rate,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:90%
aggregate demand is there.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.633 align:middle line:90%
So what is the problem?

00:26:15.633 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
My claim is that's not an
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need a
lower level of output

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:84%
to have an equilibrium
in the goods market.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.747 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
it's downward sloping.

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But why is that not an
equilibrium in the goods market?

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Or what is the nature of the
disequilibrium in the goods

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:90%
market there?

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.273 align:middle line:84%
What do we have-- an excess
demand, excess supply?

00:26:31.273 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Excess supply, meaning
there isn't enough demand

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to support that
supply, so supply

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
has to fall in order to restore
equilibrium in that market,

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And since one drags the other
one, it has to fall by a lot.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with the
slope of this curve.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
reason is negatively.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first thing
you have to understand

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:90%
when you construct this curve.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm going slowly,
but it's important.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Please try to understand--

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:90%
another way of saying it--

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
when I change the equilibrium
output along this IS curve

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
by moving the interest
rate around, what I'm doing

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:90%
is I'm moving along an IS curve.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So if the only reason why
equilibrium output is changing

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm moving
the interest rate,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that's a movement
along the IS curve.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm tracing points
of the IS curve.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to draw a contrast
between these movements

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.385 align:middle line:84%
along the IS curve versus
things that shift the Is curve.

00:27:48.385 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:90%
For example, that.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.094 align:middle line:90%
So suppose I increase taxes.

00:28:00.094 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't increase taxes.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:90%
The government increases taxes.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:84%
My claim is that the
IS shift to the left.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
That is, for any given
level of interest rate--

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
pick any interest you want.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Say this one.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
a lower equilibrium

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
output consistent with
that interest rate.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You have a lower
equilibrium consistent

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.073 align:middle line:84%
with the same interest rate
that has shifted the IS.

00:28:27.073 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a different IS.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.758 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.758 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And think that I can do that
for any given [INAUDIBLE] event.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I pick this one, but I
could have picked that one.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Would have been the same.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, if you
increase taxes,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.202 align:middle line:84%
that's going to lead to
lower equilibrium output.

00:28:43.202 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So that means that for
this higher level of taxes,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.707 align:middle line:84%
I will have to trace
a different IS curve.

00:28:50.707 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I can start moving the
interest rate around,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.415 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to have
a lower level of output

00:28:54.415 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:84%
for any given level
of interest rate

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:90%
because I have higher taxes.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So how do I know that an
increase in taxes will do this?

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.995 align:middle line:84%
Which diagram would you go
to to try to understand this?

00:29:07.995 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask it differently.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that this
stuff shift to the left?

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.882 align:middle line:90%
So I give you more open space.

00:29:22.882 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that
this increase in taxes

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.828 align:middle line:84%
will shift this IS
curve to the left?

00:29:26.828 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
How would you go about
thinking about that?

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.935 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Well, I think
there's more taxes than people

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] --disposable
income, so they're not

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:84%
going to spend as much money,
and there'll be less outcome.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Their would
be less aggregate demand,

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and less aggregate demand leads
to less output because output

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.422 align:middle line:90%
is aggregate-demand determined.

00:29:44.422 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what equilibrium
in the goods market.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can go back
to this diagram.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I could say ignore these labels
here and say, for any given

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
level of interest rate, pick
any, if I increase taxes,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shift
the ZZ curve down.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So ignore this [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that I fix the
interest rate but I now

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:90%
change taxes, increase taxes.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
exactly the same here.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move this down.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be a different
IS curve, though, because--

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
used this diagram.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me keep your answer.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I should have put
it on your diagram.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's lecture three.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.750 align:middle line:84%
In lecture three we did see
that an increase in taxes

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
would lead to lower
equilibrium output.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know
exactly by how much.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.277 align:middle line:84%
If taxes increase
by 100, then you

00:30:33.277 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
know that the
equilibrium output would

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
decline by C1 times 1 over minus
C1 are your change in taxes.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Here would be a little
different because there is also

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:84%
remembered investment also
has a propensity to spend

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
as a function of output.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a
little different,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but that's the kind
of calculation.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
What else would shift
the IS this way?

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Decrease in
government spending.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Decrease
in government expenditure

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:06.832 align:middle line:90%
will do that.

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
This is another thing I want you
to do-- think of everything--

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because for sure you're going
to face that in the quiz--

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.180 align:middle line:84%
anything that would
shift the IS curve.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:84%
What else would
shift the IS curve?

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.458 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.078 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Decreasing export.

00:31:23.078 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO:
Yeah, that's true,

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
but that's not for this
part of the course.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're in
a closed economy.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So here we assume x
equal to M equal to zero.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.110 align:middle line:90%
IM equal to zero.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:90%
That comes after quiz one.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.705 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:31:38.705 --> 00:31:44.668 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.668 --> 00:31:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Things that were
captured-- remember,

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
when I began this lecture,
I showed you wealth,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:90%
what had happened, and so on.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere wealth
in this model here.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just output.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But wealth affects how
much consumers consume.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So autonomous consumption.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
There were lots of stuff hidden
in that C0, that constant C0.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Remember C0 plus one and one.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, C0 captures things
like how confident

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
were consumers, how wealthy
they felt, and stuff like that.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So anything that shifts C0
down, consumer sentiment

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
declines, wealth declines,
something like that,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:90%
will also shift IS to the left.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's important.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So we're done with IS for now.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Now with IS alone I
cannot find what I want.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to find combinations
of interest rate and output

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent
with equilibrium

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
in the goods and
financial markets.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.210 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't do it
because it gives you

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.842 align:middle line:84%
only combinations that are
consistent with equilibrium

00:32:46.842 --> 00:32:47.675 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:53.040 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So I now need to look at
financial markets, which

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is the other side,
the LM relationship.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And remember what we had.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.022 align:middle line:84%
We had equilibrium in
the financial markets.

00:33:04.022 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
We had two instruments
that we could use.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember we had
only two assets--

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
money and bonds.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So we could look at the
equilibrium in money

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.282 align:middle line:90%
or equilibrium in bonds.

00:33:14.282 --> 00:33:14.865 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:33:14.865 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But we did it all
in terms of money.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
because given wealth,

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.855 align:middle line:84%
if one is in equilibrium,
the other one

00:33:23.855 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
has to be in
equilibrium as well.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So I only need to look at one,
and we're looking at money.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So money is equal
to money demand.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to divide
both sides by P.

00:33:35.838 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
This is not going to
be very important now,

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:90%
but later it will be.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to have that--

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:84%
This is equilibrium
in financial markets.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Means that real money supply
equals real money demand.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have here.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So this, you already see
it traces combinations

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of output and
interest rate which

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.725 align:middle line:84%
are consistent with equilibrium
in financial markets.

00:34:01.725 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:84%
In the past, that's the way
the LM would be described.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.449 align:middle line:84%
We would fix M and say,
well, this will give you

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:90%
an upward-sloping curve.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this is downward
sloping, so if this guy goes up,

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.983 align:middle line:84%
I need to-- if this is
constant, this guy goes up.

00:34:22.983 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:90%
This guy needs to come down.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:90%
What does that?

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
What does bring L down?

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
I going up, because
L prime is negative.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way LM
used to be described.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Your life is a
lot simpler today.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot simpler because
central banks don't

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:90%
target monetary aggregates.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't target M. They target
the interest rate directly.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So they tell you
the answer already.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
The central bank,
when it does policy,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
it says, look, I tell
you what I will be.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Then if output moves
around or whatever,

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
it's a problem for
M. We'll provide

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:84%
the M that the market needs
in order to have an interest

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:90%
rate equal to the one we want.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.332 align:middle line:84%
So it is true that it captures
all the combinations of output

00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and interest that are
consistent with the equilibrium

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:13.335 align:middle line:84%
in the financial markets, but
it's very simple because what

00:35:13.335 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:84%
the fed does in the US or other
central banks do is they say,

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is the
interest rate we want.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And now you can put any
amount of output you want.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
As long as we remain committed
to this interest rate,

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it will be consistent
with the equilibrium

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
in the financial markets
because we will do it so.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way we will do it so
is we'll provide as much M

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.222 align:middle line:84%
as the market needs so that
that combination of output

00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and interest rate
is an equilibrium

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in the financial market.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a very long way of
saying that the fed sets I

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and then M is whatever is
needed for this equation

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:90%
to be in equilibrium.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.675 align:middle line:84%
So if output rises
and the fed doesn't

00:35:54.675 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:84%
want to change
the interest rate,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:90%
that means you need to change M.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the fed says,
I want this interest rate

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to be fixed at this level.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Call it I0.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And now output turns
out to be higher.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:16.320 align:middle line:84%
What will the fed do in order
to ensure that I remains at I0?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
What if the fed
doesn't do anything?

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So the fed says,
I want I equals 0,

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and the fed is
calculating that output

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.730 align:middle line:90%
will be about a certain level.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
output is higher.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens if the fed doesn't
react and keeps the interest

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:90%
rate at I0?

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:84%
An output tends to be higher
than what they thought when they

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:44.350 align:middle line:84%
provided the M that they
thought the market needed

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.137 align:middle line:84%
to be in equilibrium
with that interest rate.

00:36:47.137 --> 00:36:47.845 align:middle line:90%
What will happen?

00:36:47.845 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The interest rate will go
up because money demand

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:56.687 align:middle line:90%
will exceed money supply.

00:36:56.687 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The only way to restore
equilibrium is for interest rate

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to go up.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But the fed doesn't
want that, so what

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.090 align:middle line:84%
the Fed will do is when it feels
that, it feels the interest

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
rates are going up, they
will provide more money

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:84%
so they can restore equilibrium
in the financial markets

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
at that level of interest
rate despite the fact

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that output ended up being
higher than they thought.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So all this is a long-winded
way to say that the modern LM is

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:90%
horizontal.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, that curve
would have been upward sloping.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But given the way monetary
policy is conducted nowadays,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
your life is a lot simpler.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:90%
The LM is a horizontal curve.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The fed tells you, the
central bank tells you

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
what the interest
rate has to be,

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
give whatever M, will

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
provide whatever M is needed.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's the equilibrium
interest rate.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So what shifts the modern LM?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And by modern, I only mean--

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the book doesn't use
that terminology,

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
but by modern I mean
that the fed decides

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.612 align:middle line:90%
what the interest rate is.

00:38:08.612 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Won't that
change your interest rate?

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:90%
The only thing that will shift--

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.472 align:middle line:90%
your life is very simple.

00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
will shift the modern LM

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the fed
changes its mind.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
A few years back it would
have been more complicated.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:90%
A change in money demand.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:90%
A change in money supply.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.450 align:middle line:84%
All those things would be
shifting the LM around.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Now in this setup
it's very simple.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It will change only if
the feds changes its mind.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously the fed is not
just a moody institution.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It will change the
mind, and sometimes it's

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.672 align:middle line:90%
forced to change its mind.

00:38:47.672 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not happy
with the interest

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:90%
rate they're setting nowadays.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They have been forced into that.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They were very reluctant to go
into this very high interest

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.510 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:84%
But what is happening around
with this very high consumption

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the impact that is having on
inflation, they have been forced

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.830 align:middle line:84%
into moving interest rate not
only very high but also very

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:90%
fast, and that was very risky.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.870 align:middle line:84%
We have been lucky that
nothing has really broken.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Normally when central banks
raise interest rates so fast,

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.803 align:middle line:84%
they break something
along the way.

00:39:19.803 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is very levered out
there, some bank or something

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:90%
like that, and you can blow up.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
In the UK we had a little scare
with some insurance companies,

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:34.070 align:middle line:84%
but that was for a
different reason.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's scary to move
policy very fast because this

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is a very important price
for financial markets.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything in financial
market gets priced off--

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that's the starting-- any
pricing model for stocks

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.587 align:middle line:84%
or anything will start
from that policy rate,

00:39:48.587 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
builds from there.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So if this has to move fast, you
can have lots of dislocation.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.232 align:middle line:84%
So my goal for today is just
to give you the instruments,

00:39:57.232 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to all
talk about combinations, things

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that we did in certain episodes
and things of that kind.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, this part of the
IS-LM model is very easy,

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lot easier now
than it was a few years back.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:90%
So what does the IS-LM model?

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The IS-LM model simply mean
puts the two curves together.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we have two curves in the
space of output and interest

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
rate and two unknowns, which is
output and the interest rate.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So we have one
combination only, A,

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that is consistent with both
equilibrium in the goods market

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and equilibrium in
financial markets.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the point A.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.840 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
points to the right?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
What happens here if I show
you this point in this space?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with that point?

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So a point along the
LM but to the right.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.630 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong there?

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If it is along the
LM I know that I'm

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:90%
OK with financial markets.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Those points are consistent
with the equilibrium

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:90%
in financial markets.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's not my
equilibrium, so it

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.230 align:middle line:84%
has to be inconsistent
with the other one.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not consistent
with equilibrium

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.450 align:middle line:90%
in the goods markets.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know
more than that.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with goods market?

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:84%
There's an imbalance there,
but in which direction?

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.090 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:90%
That point here.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.654 align:middle line:90%


00:41:46.654 --> 00:41:48.860 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Excess of goods.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO CABALLERO: What do
you mean by excess of goods?

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.772 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The demand
is not meeting--

00:41:52.772 --> 00:41:54.022 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO CABALLERO: No, demand.

00:41:54.022 --> 00:41:54.547 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:54.547 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Insufficient demand.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
There is too much
output for that demand.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason it's not
consistent with equilibrium

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:06.030 align:middle line:90%
To the left it's the opposite.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:10.450 align:middle line:84%
To the left we have insufficient
output for the demand we have,

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:84%
so it's not consistent with the
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So the only point that
is consistent-- well, you

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.885 align:middle line:84%
can think, what happens with
a point here, for example?

00:42:18.885 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.240 align:middle line:84%
That point, because
it's in the IS curve,

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.413 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with equilibrium
in the goods market,

00:42:25.413 --> 00:42:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's not consistent
with equilibrium

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
in financial markets.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:90%
What do we have there?

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Suppose I'm in that point.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The interest is too
high, so that means--

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and the demand is
low, so too much

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.750 align:middle line:90%
money demand for money supply.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day, this
is the only equilibrium point

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:90%
we have.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And all the experiments
we're going to do next

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:84%
have to do with moving
one curve or the other

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens to
trace new equilibrium points.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But try to understand
very well these diagrams,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.050 align:middle line:84%
so what happens when I move
up, horizontally, and so on,

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.438 align:middle line:84%
and convince yourself that
this is the only combination.

00:43:06.438 --> 00:43:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty easy to
convince yourself

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that it's the only combination,
but think a little.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Try to get away from point
A and see what happens.

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess the best way to do
that is just to do experiments,

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
meaning move parameters
of these curves

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and see how equilibrium
output changes and so on.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:30.035 align:middle line:84%
So let's do the
first experiment.

00:43:30.035 --> 00:43:30.535 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's play with this.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So now you have your
model, and now we

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
can start asking
interesting questions.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you can
ask is fiscal policy.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Well-- sorry.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.835 align:middle line:84%
So this is a contractionary
fiscal policy.

00:43:52.835 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So the same as we
did before, remember,

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.160 align:middle line:84%
we increased taxes or we
could have reduced government

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:90%
expenditure, whatever.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:90%
That would have shifted IS.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:90%
We did that.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.060 align:middle line:84%
When we look at IS,
we did exactly that.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:90%
We shift the IS to the left.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
here is, well, if you

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:84%
shift IS to the left there is
a new combination of output

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and interest rate that is
consistent with equilibrium

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:84%
in both markets, and
that's a lower output.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So if the fed
doesn't do anything,

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that means it
keeps the LM there,

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's a contractionary
fiscal policy,

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.277 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to a
contraction in output as well.

00:44:30.277 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we
call it contractionary.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Not only because fiscal--

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
not only because government
expenditure declined.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But if taxes increase,
that's contractionary

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
because it reduces aggregate
demand, and the equilibrium,

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:90%
that will reduce output.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's canonical
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:54.862 align:middle line:90%
You move output to the left.

00:44:54.862 --> 00:44:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Interest rate doesn't
move because that's

00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:84%
controlled by the fed,
but output declines.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody asks
you what happens

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:84%
if there is a
fiscal contraction,

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
you were asking a bit
the opposite side,

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:90%
that people may have spent--

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:84%
we had perhaps a fiscal
expansion that was very large.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But what happens with
a fiscal contraction?

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.212 align:middle line:84%
That will lead to lower
equilibrium output.

00:45:20.212 --> 00:45:21.587 align:middle line:84%
I keep pressing
the wrong button.

00:45:21.587 --> 00:45:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Lower equilibrium output.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you have a
very large fiscal expansion?

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you have a
very large fiscal expansion?

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:31.640 align:middle line:90%
What moves?

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That's something
you should-- that's

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.780 align:middle line:84%
a question-- you should
always ask yourself

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.920 align:middle line:84%
when there is any
question of IS-LM,

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.180 align:middle line:84%
you should ask
which curve moves.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Start from that always.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
If we ask you any question
that it's obvious about IS-LM,

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you should
ask is which curve will move.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:46:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So suppose I tell you due
to COVID, the COVID shock,

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:84%
there was a massive
income transfer

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.550 align:middle line:90%
to low-income individuals.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:84%
That is we had a very
expansionary fiscal policy.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:84%
First thing you
should ask is OK,

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:84%
which curve moves--
the LM or the IS?

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:90%
If I do that.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:21.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the IS.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Shift to the right.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Does LM move?

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:24.760 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Has nothing to do
with monetary policy.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing you need to do.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Which curve is moving?

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
If it is fiscal, that's
a good market thing.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:84%
That means it's
going to move the IS.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Not the LM.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the mechanism here?

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.505 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:46:47.505 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Remember what we have.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I told you, go always
back to this diagram.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.990 align:middle line:84%
If you increase taxes and you
keep the interest rate constant

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and you start from there so
the interest rate doesn't move,

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:84%
then that will do what
increasing taxes did

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
in lecture three- it will
reduce aggregate demand,

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and then the
multiplier will take us

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to a larger decline than the
initial fiscal contraction.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a declining
equilibrium output.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So that y1 one there is
exactly this one here.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.403 align:middle line:90%
That y prime.

00:47:25.403 --> 00:47:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I haven't moved
the interest rate.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I kept it at the same level.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I had a fiscal contraction.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what we described
with that diagram.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:90%
That's my new IS.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a new IS because
for the same interest rate

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a lower
equilibrium output.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it happens
that the fed didn't

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
change the interest rate, so
that's going to be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.380 align:middle line:84%
With the whole curve
moved to the left,

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that we could tell three slides
ago, but now I know more.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I also know that since
the fed hasn't reacted,

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
is the new equilibrium

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.953 align:middle line:90%
output, which is this.

00:48:00.953 --> 00:48:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Before, we could only tell that
the curve has shift to the left.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the fed didn't react
to that fiscal contraction,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I also know the equilibrium
output will end up at y prime.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.996 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:11.996 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stop here,
and in the next lecture

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.870 align:middle line:90%
we'll continue with this.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:33.000 align:middle line:90%
