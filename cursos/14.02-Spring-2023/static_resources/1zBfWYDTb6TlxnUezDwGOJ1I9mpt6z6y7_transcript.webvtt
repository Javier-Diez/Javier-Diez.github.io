RICARDO J. CABALLERO: OK.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's start.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:90%
So hello, everyone.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to 1402, Introduction
to Macroeconomics.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And I won't teach today.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good news.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I will start on Wednesday.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do today
is essentially tell you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:84%
what macro is about,
macroeconomics

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is about, and also
the rules of the game.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So what a difference
a single letter makes.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of you must
have taken 1401.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of you may
be taking it concurrently,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:90%
a lecture right before mine.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's Microeconomics, 1401.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:90%
This is macroeconomics.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take
a lot of imagination

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to realize that this
course is about big things.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't look at small things.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what micro is about.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Micro looks at a household,
at a firm, at an industry.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:90%
In macro we don't do that.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:90%
We look at the whole economy.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
We think about the US.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We think about China.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about
an individual price.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We think about inflation, so the
rate of change of all prices.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about
whether a particular worker

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:90%
is employed or unemployed.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We think of whether the
rate of unemployment

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is very high or low,
things of that kind.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
two countries, we

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.952 align:middle line:84%
look at the exchange rate, which
is the relative price of two

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
currencies, not to
individual goods in two

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
different countries, but the
whole currency and so on.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's what macro is about.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could think that
macro is nothing else

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of lots of micros.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
After all, that's what
an economy is made of.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
A population, a
whole population is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
made of lots of
individuals that can

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
be analyzed with
the tools of 1401

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and the sequence
that follows 1401.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't work.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are parallels in
physics about this and so on.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.713 align:middle line:84%
The way you want to
study sort of big bodies

00:02:11.713 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is different from
the way you want

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
to understand the movements
of small elements.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.964 align:middle line:90%
And that's the case in macro.

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
In macro there's a
big line of research

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with the micro
foundations of macro economics.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But even in that case, which
is very close to micro,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
most of the action ended up
happening in the non-micro part,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
in the interactions,
in the equilibrium

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the system.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much more
complicated object.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
build it from the micro,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
it would be an incredibly
complicated object.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we
need to do in macroeconomics

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:90%
is take some shortcuts.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
macro a lot of an art.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not a science, per se.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:90%
It's some sort of a science.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It has the tools of a science.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's a lot about
shortcuts and tricks

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and so on to capture the
essence of a problem that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
is very complex if
you were to model it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.465 align:middle line:90%
in all the gory details.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And in this course, we're going
to exaggerate on that sense.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.063 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to do anything
complicated, I promise you that.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Some occasionally conceptually
things will be complicated.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But the math will
not be complicated.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to keep
things very, very simple.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to communicate
the essence

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of the big macroeconomic
relationships.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:90%
This is not a PhD course.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take a
PhD course in macro,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
it would be a very
mathy type course.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the people that
do apply in micro in our PhD

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
program complain against
macro because they find it too

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.102 align:middle line:90%
mathy and so on.

00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's not going
to be the case here.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That's not what this
course is about.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:84%
My goal-- so if this
is a successful course,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
it's not that you come out
being a researcher in macro

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:90%
out of this.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you'll have
a career eventually

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and do all the next steps
that you need to do that.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to
be able to do is

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to read something like this--
this is a World Economic

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Outlook.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a publication
that the IMF puts out

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
every six months in which it
tells you how it sees the world

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and where we're
heading and so on.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
No equations there.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Lots of tables and
stuff like that.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be able to
read that kind of document

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:90%
very clearly.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to be able to
read something in say, the Wall

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Street Journal and
read even critically,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
sometimes disagreeing
with what is in there--

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Financial Times, The Economist.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a goal of this course.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a lot more than that.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just that.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
If you do a summer
internship in Wall Street

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and you work in a macro
hedge fund or whatever,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be a
good course for that.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what
traders really know.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't know a
lot more than that.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Many traders should know that.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But this does a
level of knowledge.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
If it gets to be very
complicated, I'm failing.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I
want to do here.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The typical lecture-- again,
this is not a lecture.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:84%
The first lecture
will be on Wednesday.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.637 align:middle line:84%
The typical lecture--
and not in the first part

00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
of the course because
you're not going

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to have the tools, the
definitions and so on to do it.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
What I want to do is spend
5 to 10 minutes early on.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, the first
part of the course,

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
we can do that because you don't
have the knowledge to do that.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But as you start
building tools, I

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to talk about
current events, something that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is happening out there
that I find interesting

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
or something I received
that morning, the morning

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
of the lecture, which
I find interesting.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And if I think you already have
the tools to begin to understand

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%
it, I'm going to be repetitive.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come back
two, three, four times

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:90%
to the same topic.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.625 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you'll be more
advanced in your knowledge

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
in the later stages
and you'll be

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
able to understand
it more and more.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The typical lecture will
have 5 to 10 minutes

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
in which we'll talk about
some facts, something

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:90%
that is going on.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
picture like this.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
This I received this morning.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I think this came from Goldman,
I think, Goldman Sachs.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you have in
that picture-- again,

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about
details today--

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is you have two lines.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a measure of
wages, wage growth, compensation

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:90%
to workers.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And another one is a
measure of inflation.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, all those
definitions will

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
come in the next
lecture on inflation.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's the rate at which--

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
you must have heard
about inflation.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's something,
prices are rising.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And what that picture shows
you is that these two series

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:90%
are very highly correlated.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So when wage growth is high,
inflation tends to be high.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
issue on these days.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of concern
about this stuff.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So let me try to explain
a little bit what

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:90%
is a concern on these days.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you don't understand
anything, doesn't matter.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't
understand anything I'm

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
saying right now in the last
lecture, then it matters.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
But now it doesn't matter.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to give you a
flavor of the kind of things

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:90%
we'll be talking about.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
That picture there,
again, a variable

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that will define in the
next lecture, not now,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
shows you the unemployment rate.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't need any
specific definition

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
to know that to feel,
at least get a sense,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that, well, if unemployment is
high, workers aren't very happy.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good thing to
have lots of unemployment.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And what that series
shows you the shaded areas

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:90%
are recessions in the US.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
What that series shows you is
that typically in recessions,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
unemployment goes up.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's one of the features.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.865 align:middle line:84%
One of the main
features of a recession

00:07:37.865 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:90%
is that unemployment is high.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
This episode here, it's
called the Great Recession--

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
as a parallel for
the Great Depression.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
The US had the Great
Depression in the '30s.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the Great
Recession, the biggest sort

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
of recession outside of the
Great Depression in the US.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's also known as the
Global Financial Crisis

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
because this was a recession
all around the world.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And what you can see is that
unemployment went very high.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a very feature,
a telltale sign

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:90%
of a big recession.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And then it took a long time.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
This was in recovering.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.945 align:middle line:84%
COVID was a massive
shock to the labor market

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So not surprisingly,
unemployment, the unemployment

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:90%
rate spike there.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But then it also
recover, a lot faster

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:90%
than it recovered from that.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And today we have
unemployment rates that

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:90%
are at historically low levels.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big issue.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
The rate of
unemployment in the US

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
is at historically low levels--

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:90%
way below what is normal.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Forget recessions, obviously
way below what is it

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
happens in recessions, but
even way below what is normal,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
what happens during
normal times.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Closely related to
that is wage growth.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I have just one measure of wages
there, is a series of wage that

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:90%
is particularly--

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
what I'm about to say
is particularly sharp,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the wages of in the
accommodation and food service

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
sectors.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So wages have been rising very
steadily and very fast recently

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
everywhere,
particularly in sectors

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
like this, where we
have some problems which

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
we call labor supply.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.962 align:middle line:90%
But I'll get back to that.

00:09:19.962 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:90%
So those are two facts.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We have unemployment
at extremely low levels

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and we have wage growth
at a very fast pace.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, that sounds wonderful, no?

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what else do you want,
an economy which is few people

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
unemployed and wages
are growing a lot.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if this was micro,
this would be fantastic.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, look the guy is employed
and he's getting a high wage.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, not so fast for macro.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Not so fast because I already
showed you in the first picture

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that I showed you,
[INAUDIBLE] there

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.682 align:middle line:84%
is a connection between
wage growth and inflation.

00:09:56.682 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're experiencing.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
The normal level of inflation
for an economy like the US

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:90%
is around 2%.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's normal.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what central banks
target in an economy like the US

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:90%
in the Euro area.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Japan has been dreaming with 2%,
but hasn't been able for decades

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to get it.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Although now they are.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't, for a couple
of decades, to get to 2%.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's about-- and we will
discuss later in the course

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
why 2% is about right for
economies of the size of the US

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously in recessions,
these things can go low.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
the COVID recessions

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
inflation went to
zero, essentially.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:90%
But then it began to pick up.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's now at levels, which
are unheard of in the US since

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
the '80s.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the particular
measure you use of inflation,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
it's around 6.5% to 8%.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a level of
inflation we have,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
which is way, way above
what is considered

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
a normal or reasonable
target for the central banks

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
for inflation.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's a problem.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We have had some good news
recently in that inflation

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
clearly peaked already--

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
again, definition of inflation,
formal definition of inflation

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:90%
happens in the next lecture.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.108 align:middle line:90%
But it already peaked.

00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's declining.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.415 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a very,
very high levels.

00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's a problem.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.923 align:middle line:84%
That's a big
macroeconomic problem.

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we want
to understand in this course

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
is, well, what to do about it.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:84%
What do central banks need to
do in order to deal with that?

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been
talking about the US.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But this is not
specific to the US.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
This episode this
recovery from COVID

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is incredibly common across
different regions of the world.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you see it everywhere
with a few exceptions.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about one
major exception in a minute.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's widespread.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a widespread phenomenon
that we had high unemployment.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Then we had sort of very high--

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
well, I haven't told
you that part yet.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But then we had sort
of low inflation.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Then inflation
picked up enormously.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we're all worried
about these very high levels

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:90%
of inflation.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look
at what happened

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
between the Great Recession
and the COVID recession,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty normal
to have 70% to 80%

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of the economies in the
world having inflation

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
levels at or below 2%.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.805 align:middle line:90%
So that's a norm.

00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
If they throw you
into a country,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
they drop you into a country,
the normal thing would be well,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:90%
it's about 2%.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a level of inflation.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.898 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if I dropped
you in Argentina,

00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find a much
bigger number, you know,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
10,000%.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But the bulk of the countries
were around 2% or so.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Today you don't find any
country with inflation below 2%.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Not even Japan, for years
we're in deflation and trying

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:90%
to get sort of above zero.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:90%
That's all they wanted.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Not even in Japan you have
inflation below 2% today.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:90%
So this thing I showed you.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And for more or less
the same reasons,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:90%
it's happening everywhere.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly the same factors.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
episode, for example,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
with differences depending on
the structure of the economy

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:90%
or in additional shocks.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, for example they
had very high inflation.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
But the problem is not--

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the problem,
the bulk of the problem

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:90%
is the same as in the US.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But at the margin
they are different.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, the big
driver of inflation,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
the big recent
driver of inflation,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is unlike the US, which is
aggregate demand, a concept

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:90%
you'll understand later.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.547 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially
the war in Ukraine.

00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
That has increased the price of
energy and the price of energy

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%
has led to lots of inflation.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
So there are different reasons.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But all of them are sort
of different reasons

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that you add on top of what
is a common story, which

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
is that we overheated coming
out of the COVID episode

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and now we're
struggling with that.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the main tool--
and we're going

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to talk a lot about
in this course--

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
the main tool that central banks
have to deal with inflation

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:90%
is the interest rate.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So for reasons you'll
understand later,

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
although you may have intuition
about some of those now,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
obviously when the central
bank lowers the interest rates,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
then that helps the
economy to expand.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And when it increases interest
rate, then it does the opposite.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Rising Interest rate makes
mortgages more expensive,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
make everything more expensive
so people tend to consume less.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Firms tend to invest
less and so on

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's more expensive
to invest, to borrow, to do

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.970 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And there you see it.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was the level of
the interest rate in the US

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
before COVID.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:90%
When COVID came, boom.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.563 align:middle line:84%
They brought it
all the way down.

00:14:47.563 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It happens that you can
not bring the interest

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:90%
rate a lot lower than zero.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason it
stayed close to zero.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that later on.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.253 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually
they realized

00:14:57.253 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:90%
that we're behind the curve.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Inflation had picked up a
lot and the central banks

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:90%
were behind the curve.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So they began to hike
rates in a hurry.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we have been
experiencing for the last year

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
or so, very fast increase
in the interest rate.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is, of course,
about macroeconomics.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But I happen to do
a lot of research

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
between macro and finance.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put a little bit
more of a component of finance

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going
to do most of that

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:90%
in the last third of the course.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But monetary policy has lots
of implications for finance,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
for equity, values,
for the stock market,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So what you see here, this
line here, is the SPX 500.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:51.775 align:middle line:84%
It's the main index of
equity in the US of shares.

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%
There are several indices--

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:90%
NASDAQ, S&P, Dow, and so on.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the main index,
the most comprehensive,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the one that takes
the largest companies,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.727 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And what you can see
what happens here

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
is that when COVID happened,
the surprise that we had,

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
really a pandemia, then
the stock market crash,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
declined like 30% or something
like that at the time.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting facets.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one
characteristic of equity

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:90%
that I like a lot.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Other risky assets, as well, but
they anticipate what happens.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
What happened there
is the stock market,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the shareholders, realized
that something big

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
was-- negative and big-- was
happening in front of us.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
So it was time to sell.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the equity
market collapsed.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
What happens next is
even more interesting

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:47.328 align:middle line:84%
for a macro economist,
which is this big boom here.

00:16:47.328 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:90%
There's an enormous boom.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The economy here still
was at levels of activity

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.085 align:middle line:90%
below what it had before COVID.

00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But the stock market, the
value in the stock market

00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
had way exceeded the level
we had before the pandemic.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And the main driver of that,
I've shown that in some papers,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
the main driver of that is not--

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean people tell lots
of stories of Amazon

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
and so on, Tesla,
bla, blah, blah.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the aggregate,
the main reason for that rise

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:90%
was monetary policy.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
You can explain all that
increase in the equity value

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in the US of the index--
not the individual shares,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:90%
of the index--

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%
by the effect of interest rates.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy
plays a big role.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
If you care about
finance, well, it

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
plays a huge role in
the value of assets.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
When monetary policy
is very loose,

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that tends to increase
the value of assets.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
mechanisms the central banks

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.695 align:middle line:84%
use to expand aggregate
demand when they want

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:90%
to expand aggregate demand.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.903 align:middle line:84%
They want people to feel--
you are in a recession,

00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you want people to feel richer
so they spend more and so on

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
What happened here?

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.468 align:middle line:84%
This decline, you can
also explain it fully

00:17:54.468 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
with the hike in interest rate.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.885 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I showed you that
the interest rate began

00:17:57.885 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to rise very rapidly here.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, last year the
equity market in the US

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and most major equity
markets around the world

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:90%
declined by 20% or more.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You can explain all
that decline simply

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:90%
by increasing the interest rate.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.905 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing
we need to understand

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is why is it that the interest--
why is the interest rate

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
matter so much for
something like equity?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So when a value assets,
and when I see what

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:84%
is the effect of
the interest rate,

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to think about, well,

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
why would the central bank worry
or not worry about these things,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that financial
markets and the central banks

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:90%
interact all the time.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you are into
Wall Street type thing,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
you are going to be watching
every day, every time

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.763 align:middle line:90%
that the monetary minutes.

00:18:42.763 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
The minutes of the central
banks are released,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be watching
because it has a big implication

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.105 align:middle line:90%
for the value of your equity.

00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, something very
interesting of this nature

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:90%
happened last week.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:84%
On Friday, last
Friday, there was

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:90%
a release of payroll numbers.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's an employment
index, employment numbers.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And people expected the
payroll to increase,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.688 align:middle line:90%
so to add nonfarm payroll--

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
these things later--

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
by about 190,000 workers.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
At 8:30-- well and this,
you're seeing here,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is the behavior of the same
index I showed you before,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
but the futures, so things you
can trade before the market

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:90%
actually opens.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The market in the
US opens at 9:30 AM.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But you can trade
futures since Asia times.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so this is the path.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
It's all very quiet, tranquil.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is waiting the release
of this news at 8:30 AM.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.595 align:middle line:84%
At 8:30 AM, great news
for the labor market.

00:19:48.595 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The actual change in the
payroll was not 190k.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It was over a 500,000k.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.428 align:middle line:84%
So enormous addition
of jobs to the economy.

00:20:02.428 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And look what happens
to the equity market.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:90%
It imploded immediately.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is wonderful news now
for the economy-- lots of jobs.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The equity market imploded
as a result of that.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.132 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that happened?

00:20:18.132 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I've already given
you a little bit

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
of the ingredients
for why, for an answer

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:90%
in the previous slides?

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm showing you
this is because in 15 minutes,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
it summarizes all that I was
talking about in the previous 30

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
minutes.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that happened?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful news.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Why the stock market should
crash like 2% from top

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:90%
to bottom as a result of that?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: There's
a lot more labor

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
because that gives a lot
more supply of that thing,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and thus, it decreases price
because of high supply.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: No, but--

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's an
interesting explanation.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not the one I have in mind.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The explanation says, look, that
means firms hire lots of people.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So the price, that
means they're going

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to be lots of supply of whatever
goods they're producing.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The price of those goods
is going to decline.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
be bad for profits.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.502 align:middle line:90%
That's a story you had in mind.

00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's some of that.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm willing to bet that
it's not the main thing.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So the only clue I give
you is that I already

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
talk about these things
five minutes ago.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Employment
is very closely related

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
to inflation rates.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.352 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] up to 0.81.

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So this could be a
result of expectations

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.887 align:middle line:84%
of continued high
inflation rates.

00:21:54.887 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
OK, you're very close.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:90%
One step more.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:90%
That means that--

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.453 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:03.453 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
OK, there you are.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
The shareholders wouldn't
have done anything

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
if they thought that
the Fed would not

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
be able to see this data.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But they know that the
Fed also sees this data

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and say, whoa,
these guys are going

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to be worried because
the economy is

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:90%
going to keep overheating.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.633 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have to hike interest

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
rates even more in order
to cool down this economy.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I already showed you that what
happens in the labor market

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
is very connected to what
happens with inflation.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:90%
The central bank knows that.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And now we get this big surprise
that means they're not really

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
being able to-- they're
not being successful

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
at really slowing down one of
the main drivers of inflation.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so financial markets
are very forward looking.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:90%
They say, whoa, this is coming.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.640 align:middle line:84%
This only means that
financial markets

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
were betting that
the Fed was going

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to begin to cut interest rates
in four months more or so.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at what
the forwards did there,

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
what the market--

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
you can extract what
the market thinks.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Right after this, it got
immediately pushed out

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the year.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.608 align:middle line:90%
So it's precise.

00:23:09.608 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the anticipation
that the central bank

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:90%
will have to do something.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought it
was very interesting

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:90%
for that point of view.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Recessions-- well, look.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
very good news.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But everyone knows that the Fed
needs to cool off the economy.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So despite the fact that
we're getting good news now,

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
people expect, the
majority of people

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.245 align:middle line:84%
expect a recession in
the US for this year.

00:23:38.245 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to explain
this bar graph here.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:90%
But these are forecasts.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
These are professional
forecasters.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And more than half of them--

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
so the median of them thinks
that there is a 65% probability

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is a recession
in the US this year.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk a lot about this

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and probably we're going to
be getting news about this

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.458 align:middle line:90%
while we're taking the course.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
a picture that we're

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:90%
going to discuss extensively.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for the
recession is nothing else than--

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The reason you ask this
forecast, why do you

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:90%
think we may have a recession?

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.712 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the Fed is
trying to fight inflation.

00:24:17.712 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It's going to keep
hiking interest rates.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it
may break something.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reason.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But all these
things you are going

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand
very clearly through models.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want to
say before telling you

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
a little bit the
rules of the game

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is that I said before that the
story I told you about the US

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is more or less what is
happening all around.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I was in Chile a month ago.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chilean.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.247 align:middle line:90%
And they have the same story.

00:24:49.247 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They start hiking interest rates
a little earlier because they

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.647 align:middle line:90%
had more inflation than the US.

00:24:53.647 --> 00:24:55.355 align:middle line:84%
But they're going
through the same cycle.

00:24:55.355 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:84%
There's one big economy,
the second largest economy

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
in the world, that has not been
part of this, which is China.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:84%
China was very aggressive
in the COVID policy,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
so zero COVID policy.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.945 align:middle line:84%
So they really slowed
down their economy.

00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a consequence.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.987 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want to do that.

00:25:14.987 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But as a result of a
very strict COVID policy,

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
they essentially shut down
big parts of the economy

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That, by the way, had big
impact in the rest of the world,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.635 align:middle line:84%
through the network
of production,

00:25:26.635 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the chains of production
and stuff like that.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:90%
That was inflationary in itself.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:90%
That part is dissipating.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But for their own economy,
for the domestic economy,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that really slowed down China,
an economy that grew typically

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
at 5 and 1/2 to 6%, a
lot higher 15 years ago.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to
understand why later on.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But last year, I don't
know, it was 3% or less.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Numbers in China were
difficult to figure it out.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They're not equally
transparent to other numbers.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
it's very clear

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:90%
that China slowed down a lot.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And that policy
recently changed.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:90%
The zero-COVID policy changed.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
great expectation

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that now there is going
to be a big boom in China

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:90%
because they are lagging behind.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the US when
COVID began to dissipate,

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.643 align:middle line:90%
we got a huge boost to growth.

00:26:20.643 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the reason
we got all this inflation is

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
because we had lots of growth
coming out of the recession that

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:90%
happened in COVID.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And more or less the same
is expected in China.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big reasons
behind those big bounce backs

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.428 align:middle line:90%
is when people are desperate.

00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:36.762 align:middle line:90%
They want to spend on something.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:39.588 align:middle line:84%
They want to go to restaurants
and cinemas and stuff like that.

00:26:39.588 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is they
have the means to do it

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't spend
on anything for a while.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they can travel
and stuff like that.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So people expect-- and this
is a very large economy

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
that suddenly sort of wakes up.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:84%
No, that's a big
thing for China.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a big
thing for the world.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
What happens in China
doesn't stay in China.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a big giant.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So it moves.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And for some countries
it's very, very important.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And this picture
here shows you what

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
is the impact on
different regions

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
of the world on the growth
rate and different regions

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the world of an increase
by 1% in the rate of growth

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:90%
of China.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously all the
neighbors benefit a lot.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But Latin America
benefits even more.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, because Latin
America produces

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:84%
lots of commodities
and China consumes

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
lots of commodities when it's
building and stuff like that.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason
big impact on Latin America.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is a piece of good
news for the world in the sense

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:90%
that activity will go up.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's good news on average.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But it may be too much
of a good thing, as well.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Because many economists
are going through what

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:90%
we described before.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
bring down inflation.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.177 align:middle line:90%
They don't want more demand.

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They want less for
now because we're

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
going to understand that
connection later on how

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
demand connects to inflation.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
But you want less.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going to get this
impulse from China, which is

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.305 align:middle line:90%
going to fuel more inflation.

00:28:11.305 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for China because they
don't have an inflation problem.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But it may be a problem
for many of the countries

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to undo the
inflationary consequences

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of the previous expansion, the
expansion that followed COVID.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, anyways.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But this is the kind of things
we're going to be talking about.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I said the course is
not going to be mathy,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
be all about models.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The next lecture is
the most boring lecture

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
of the course I tell you
in advance because it's

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.010 align:middle line:90%
definitions.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.552 align:middle line:84%
I need to go through
the definitions.

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:90%
At least I get bored.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But the rest, there's
always little models

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:90%
but it's simple models.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, but the models
are going to try

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
to explain the kind of
things I discussed today.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this
course is about.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.333 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, if we're
successful, you're

00:28:57.333 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be able
to read something

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:84%
like the World Economic
Outlook, which will have

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:90%
lots of pictures like this.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.525 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be able to
write a little equation very

00:29:05.525 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
simple on the side
to try to understand

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:84%
what is going on there, and to
catch the mistakes, as well.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, WEO has less mistakes
than the Wall Street Journal,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
but you will catch
mistakes, you'll see,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:90%
you'll be proud of those.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:90%
