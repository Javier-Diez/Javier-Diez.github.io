00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
OK, so let's

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:90%
continue with this IS-LM model.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember in the
previous lecture,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:90%
we set up-- we set it up.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.605 align:middle line:90%
We built the IS-LM model.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go over that very
quickly in this lecture

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
very important for you.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And then, we're going to use it.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
we're going to talk

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
the policy response,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
the macroeconomic policy
response during the COVID-19

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
shock, or recession,
all of the above.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So the starting point--
remember, the first thing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
we did, we constructed
the IS relation.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And the IS relation was
just the same as lecture 3.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
But we sort of spelled out
what is inside that investment

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that we had taken
as a constant there.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We said, well,
far more realistic

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
is to make investment
itself increasing

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
in output because it's
increasing in sales.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
That won't change the analysis
that we had in lecture three.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
All that will do is change the
slope of the aggregate demand

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
curve, and therefore
change the multiplier.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But we could have
solved everything

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:90%
in terms of lecture three.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
What made this a little
different from lecture three

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we also said
the investment--

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
real investment--
remember, this has

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with financial
investment-- real investment is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
also a decreasing function
of the interest rate.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.795 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And that led to the IS
relationship, which essentially

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
says these are all--
the IS curve traces

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
all the combinations of
output and interest rate

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent with
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of that IS.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
in lecture three,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
we were able to determine
the equilibrium output.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Here, we can't.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.784 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we?

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:16.502 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because we're
tracing a curve [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.168 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Yeah, we have

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to announce its output
and the interest rate.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have only one
relationship, the IS curve.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for
the LM curve is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that we need to pin down
the second variable.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's what LM will do.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.272 align:middle line:84%
And it will be sort of
very brutal about it.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
In the past, you remember it was
some upward-sloping relationship

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] said in the
previous-- no, that's not what

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:90%
the central banks do today.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:90%
They just set the interest rate.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So if the central bank
sets the interest rate,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
then you can use lecture
three to pin down

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium in the goods
market, which is what you would

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:90%
effectively be doing here.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
If you fix this interest
rate at whatever level

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the central bank
wants, then now you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
have one curve for one
unknown, which is output.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
we saw in lecture three.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.695 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:07.195 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So I said, lecture three now,
this ZZ curve [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
a little steeper
because investment also

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
responds positively to
increases in output.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, now we
have an interest rate,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
which is a shifted of
this aggregate demand.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
In particular, if the
interest rate goes up,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
what happens to that curve?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.097 align:middle line:84%
So as the interest
rate goes up, what

00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
happens to the
aggregate demand curve?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I have two candidates
here, down or up.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Goes down?

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.395 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Down.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because investment drops.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.227 align:middle line:84%
So you can tell me even more
by how much-- if I tell you

00:03:53.227 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
how much a change
in the interest rate

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is, and I tell you what is
the sensitivity of investment

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to the interest rate,
you know exactly

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.928 align:middle line:84%
by how much this
thing will come down.

00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the
change in the interest

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.655 align:middle line:84%
rate times the sensitivity
of the investment function

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:90%
to the interest rate.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
That's not the end of the
story, as you well know.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the horizontal
shift in aggregate demand.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
But the final decline
in output will

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
be larger than that initial
decline in investment

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
higher interest rate.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So someone, say the Fed,
raises interest rate,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that immediately
reduces investment

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because investment is negatively
related to the interest rate.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
That immediately decreases
aggregate demand, which

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.952 align:middle line:90%
immediately decreases output.

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
part of the course,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
output is determined
by aggregate demand.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the adjustments
stopped there.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
No, that's what the
multiplier was about.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Because now with lower income,
there is lower consumption

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and actually lower investment
as a result of that,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and we keep going.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So the final decline in
output is a lot larger.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And doing that
kind of experiment,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
moving the interest
rate around and seeing

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
equilibrium output,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we derive-- we
constructed the IS curve.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.965 align:middle line:84%
Here is for-- a cut
in the interest rate.

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is exactly the
experiment I just described.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you raise
the interest rate,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
then aggregate
demand comes down.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.653 align:middle line:84%
And then output
declines by a lot more

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
than the initial decline
in investment because

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of the multiplier,
but eventually, we

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
get to another equilibrium
output, which is that.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that this
point belongs to the IS curve

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
because it's a combination of
output, Y-prime, and interest

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
rate, I-prime, that is
consistent with the equilibrium

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
in the goods market.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what lecture
three told us.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what equilibrium in
the goods markets look like.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
That's another point
of the same IS.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I have higher output
here, lower interest rate.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
That's another point of the IS.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason this
is downward sloping.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Look at what I just said.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, I have another
point of the same IS.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
How do I know it's the same
IS and not some other IS?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.445 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
All that I told you there
is I found two points,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
two combinations of
output and interest rate,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent with
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
But I said a little more.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.575 align:middle line:84%
I said, and that's part-- that's
the way we construct one IS.

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because you're holding
everything like tax [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.912 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a lot of other
parameters that we're keeping

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:90%
constant there.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the distinction
between a movement

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
along an IS curve, which is--

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
the only thing I move
is the interest rate

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to trace a
movement along a single IS.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
If I move something else, like
taxes, foreign expenditure,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
or autonomous consumption by--

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
something like that, then I will
be shifting the aggregate demand

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:90%
for any given interest rate.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get a
different level of output

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.743 align:middle line:84%
for any given interest
rate, which means I'm

00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be in a different IS.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did there.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:84%
In that case there,
we said, look,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I can fix the interest rate,
any interest rate you want.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick this one.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.163 align:middle line:84%
But I could have done it
at an interest rate here,

00:07:22.163 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:90%
there, whatever.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, I say, what
happens if I increase taxes?

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, you know from
lecture three exactly what

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.362 align:middle line:84%
happens when the
interest rate is constant

00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
because there, we didn't even
talk about the interest rate.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.525 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was a function
of the interest rate.

00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And you increase taxes.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would reduce
disposable income

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.173 align:middle line:84%
for any given level
of output, and that

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
will lead to a contraction in
aggregate demand and output,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and so forth.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So that means that for
this interest rate,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
now I found another point--

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
another point that is an
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But it belongs to a
different IS because I

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
moved one of the parameters,
which is the taxes.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.902 align:middle line:84%
And now for this
higher level of taxes,

00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I can play around with
the interest rate.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I can say, well, what happens
if I cut interest rates?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.295 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I cut
the interest rate,

00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:13.135 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find another
equilibrium, say here--

00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
if I cut the interest
rate from here to here,

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find another
equilibrium level of output

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
which is consistent
with that very same IS.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Why is that very same IS?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I haven't
moved taxes again.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.275 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I'm repeating
this is because, I told you,

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
to understand

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
what is a movement along the
IS versus what shifts the IS.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Then, we move to
the LM relation.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And the LM relation
is just equilibrium

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:90%
in the financial markets.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
This is combinations of
output and interest rate

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that are consistent
with equilibrium

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:90%
in financial markets.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And we constructed
from our money supply

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
equal to money demand
in nominal terms.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Then, we divided
by P, which is not

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.002 align:middle line:84%
very interesting in
this part of the course

00:09:01.002 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
because P is constant.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We are assuming that
P is not moving.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the price of
goods and services.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this equilibrium here

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:90%
now stated in real terms.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So real money supply is
equal to real money demand.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, had you taken
this course a few years back,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps in other places,
that would have been

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:90%
an upward-sloping relationship.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.393 align:middle line:84%
So the LM would have been an
upward-sloping relationship.

00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
How do I know it's
upward-sloping?

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, because if I don't
change money supply

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and I increase output, then
I need to bring LI down.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And since L-prime is negative,
the way to bring L down

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:84%
is by increasing
the interest rate.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's what it
would have given you,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:90%
an upward-sloping LM curve.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, we don't do that
now because, really, banks,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
central banks abandoned a
long time ago in most parts

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of the world-- not everywhere--
this idea of targeting M.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But they target directly
the interest rate,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and then they give you
whatever M that you need--

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.375 align:middle line:84%
they need in order for the
equilibrium in financial markets

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to be consistent with
the interest rate

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:90%
the central bank wants to set.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.615 align:middle line:84%
So I said the modern IS
curve really looks like that.

00:10:13.615 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
The Fed and the US central
bank, anywhere else,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
sets the interest rate.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Turkey is a little different.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
[SOFT LAUGHS] But sets
the interest rate.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's the LM.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, this particular LM says--

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:90%
it's a flat curve.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not a function of output.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:90%
The Fed sets the interest rate.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:90%
It's flat.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not upward-sloping
or anything.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the question,
what shifts the modern LM?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.053 align:middle line:90%
Only the central bank.

00:10:51.053 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the central bank is
the one that sets the interest

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:90%
rate, certainly in--

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.467 align:middle line:84%
well, let me not
complicate things.

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's the interest rate.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So if the central bank
doesn't change its mind,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
then the interest rate
is whatever it is,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:90%
and the LM will remain there.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So we put the two
things together,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and now we can pin down
equilibrium output.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, we had--
when we just looked at the IS,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.523 align:middle line:84%
we had combinations of
interest rate and output

00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that were consistent with
equilibrium in the goods market.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.053 align:middle line:84%
Now we have an
interest rate which

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with
the equilibrium

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
in financial markets, that's
what the central bank is there

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
to ensure.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
interest rate, we can

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
look into the IS, what is
the level of output that

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to that.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what we get here.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
So now, we found an equilibrium.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
We found a combination
of interest and output

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that is consistent with the
equilibrium in both goods

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:90%
markets and financial markets.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
IS-LM model is about.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding
those combinations.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Is this very clear?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So now we can begin to
play with this stuff.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the main purposes
of the IS-LM model

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
is to understand policy,
macroeconomic policies,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
what you should do in
certain environments or not.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, before knowing
what you should

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
do in certain
environments, you need

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is it that
the different macroeconomic

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
policies do to equilibrium
output and interest rate,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we began to do.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And the first experiment
was one of fiscal policy.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of a
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
That could happen as a--
contractionary fiscal policy

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is essentially
increasing taxes, like we

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
illustrated before, or a
reduction in government

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
expenditure.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Either of those will lead to
a shift in the IS to the left.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember from lecture three,
if I increase taxes or reduce

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
government expenditure,
equilibrium output will fall.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.395 align:middle line:90%
Thus, lecture three.

00:13:04.395 --> 00:13:04.895 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And so I can trace--

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:84%
using lecture three, I
can tell you, well, the IS

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
will shift to the left.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:90%
No, we just did that.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But now we know
more because we know

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that the central bank is also
pinning down the interest rate.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
example here, the central bank

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.825 align:middle line:84%
did not go along with
the Treasury Department

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I'm going to keep
the interest rate wherever

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You do whatever you want
with the fiscal policy.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example
of a situation where

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
fiscal policy is contractionary
and the central bank remains

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
with its previous target,
interest rate target.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of that, a
contractionary fiscal policy,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
as the word says
then, is a contraction

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
in aggregate demand
policy ends up also

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
leading to a lower
equilibrium output.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask, I already told
you two things, T up or G down.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But what else would do
something similar to this,

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.585 align:middle line:90%
which is not policy?

00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:21.305 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Just any shock
of aggregate demand, right?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I want anything that is a
shock to aggregate demand

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.405 align:middle line:84%
different from interest
rate or anything like that.

00:14:28.405 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
consumer confidence,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:90%
that thing that we put in C0.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Or wealth, something
that wasn't in the model

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
but clearly what
is behind C0, that

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
would lead to a shock like
that, and that's contractionary.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason central
banks and financial markets

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
are all the time looking at the
releases of surveys of consumer

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
confidence and
things of that kind

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
implications of shocks

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to consumer
confidence and so on.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
mechanism here, well, we

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
have discussed it
multiple times.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
The contraction in fiscal policy
lowers the aggregate demand

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Then, we multiply and you end
up lowering output a lot more.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.935 align:middle line:84%
And this happens for
a given interest rate.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm having the
same interest rate

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
here and there because
I'm looking at two points

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
along for a fixed LM, for
a fixed interest rate.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the contractionary
monetary policy.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, an
expansionary fiscal policy

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is just a shift in the
opposite direction.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So what will an
expansionary fiscal policy

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.025 align:middle line:90%
do to equilibrium output?

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Expansionary.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It will increase output,
again, contractionary

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.132 align:middle line:84%
fiscal policy reduce output
or will it do the opposite?

00:15:55.132 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it will
increase output.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's expansionary
fiscal policy.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important
tool to move output

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
around when the
economy's in a recession,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:90%
or so on and so forth.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
The other canonical
macroeconomic policy

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:90%
is monetary policy.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example of an
expansionary monetary policy.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So an expansionary monetary
policy cuts the interest rate.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Why is that expansionary?

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, look, it is expansionary--

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.015 align:middle line:90%
let me take this as--

00:16:25.015 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
things in a step.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
So claim first.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.575 align:middle line:84%
An expansionary monetary
policy is a reduction

00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:90%
in the interest rate.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So the central bank now
decides to set a lower interest

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
rate than it used to.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:90%
As a result of that--

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
if output didn't
change, what would

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:90%
happen in the goods market?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the Fed cuts the
interest rate and output doesn't

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.535 align:middle line:84%
Is there an equilibrium
in the goods market?

00:16:50.535 --> 00:16:57.787 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.787 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there an equilibrium
in the goods market?

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the Fed cuts the
interest rate and now we say,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, nothing
will happen here.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Output will stay where it is.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
We will have a lower
interest rate, that's nice.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Why is that not the final
outcome of the monetary policy

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.936 align:middle line:90%
expansion?

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.062 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because then
the [INAUDIBLE] market

00:17:20.062 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
reacts and aggregate
demand [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Exactly, this is an imbalance.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
No, because aggregate demand
now, at low interest rate,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:90%
investment will go up.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
This fiscal
investment, remember,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
purchases of goods
and services by firms

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of building
capital, structures,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.985 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:37.853 align:middle line:84%
So aggregate demand
went up, so now we

00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:90%
have a disequilibrium there.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Output is less than
aggregate demand.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.817 align:middle line:84%
And we know that output is
determined by aggregate demand,

00:17:42.817 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we go on through
all the mechanism.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, it's
not at equilibrium.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end up with
a higher level of output.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
At that lower interest rate, we
have a lower level of output.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's not
surprising that we

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
call this an expansionary
monetary policy.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So when the Fed cuts
the interest rate,

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that's an expansionary
monetary policy.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
This will expand
aggregate demand.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So how does the
Fed implement this?

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: They can do
expansionary open market

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:90%
operations.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Yeah, there you are.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So what they need to do is do
some expansionary monetary open

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:90%
market operation.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, now it's a little
more sophisticated than that,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%
but let's stick with this.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
That is the first
thing they'll do

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:90%
is they'll shift money supply.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll go out there and they
start buying bonds and giving

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:90%
money to--

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
injecting money into the system,
particularly through the banks.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's the initial response.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what will cut
the interest rate.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:54.625 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
This will allow me to
illustrate the modern IS.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Fed's
decision was not

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
to increase the
money supply by 35%.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
What the Fed communicated
to the market

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
was that it was going to cut
interest rates by 50 basis

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the communication.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So initially, the way it
does that overnight is it

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
goes out and does exactly that.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So what it did is
what we have there.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
We had some interest rate, I0.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:90%
The Fed now wants to go to I1.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.954 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.954 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do
that, well, you

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
have to look at this money
demand and increase money supply

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the
lower interest rate.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.275 align:middle line:84%
The question I'm asking you
now, does it stop there?

00:19:57.275 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Fed says,
OK, I did my job,

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to lower
the interest rate.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to increase
M. I increase M.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, I manage to bring
the interest rate down

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to that point.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And that-- they're
intervening overnight market,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:90%
so that happens very quickly.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the Fed
now can sleep for a while?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:30.962 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many reasons why the
feds cannot sleep for a long

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.675 align:middle line:84%
time, but in this
particular case.

00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: OK, yes.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Money demand will increase.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Why?

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.023 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because now,
[INAUDIBLE] increasing?

00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:53.065 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: No.

00:20:53.065 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first shock was an
increase in money supply.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
The point-- the
thing you want to say

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
is that because now the
interest rate is lower,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium output will go up.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But if equilibrium--
output goes up,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
then what happens
in this diagram?

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, the money demand goes up.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, one of
the parameters in this curve

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
was output.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
This was output times LI
That's that curve there.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
In this money demand, I
had output fixed at Y0.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But now equilibrium
output is higher,

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
so this curve will
also shift out.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
have Y1 LI there.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:90%
So what will the Fed do?

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:84%
See, the Fed doesn't do
anything and it stops here,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:84%
then the interest rate goes
back up, not necessarily

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to the old level,
but it will go up.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So what the Fed will have to
do is keep expanding money.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, it's an ugly diagram.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But it will keep
expanding money up to--

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
so it can preserve
the interest rate.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.928 align:middle line:84%
In the old analysis, you would
have stopped in the first shot,

00:22:05.928 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:90%
but nowadays, that's not.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The Fed says, look, I'm
going to provide money,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and I know it takes time for
output to expand and all that,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
so I will accommodate
all that comes.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It will not come overnight, all
this extra demand for money,

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
but I know there will be
more demand coming along

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
if I'm successful at
expanding economic activity.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the central bank knows that
if this ends up happening, then

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that it will have to provide
more money than initially just

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the interest
rate at the lower rate level.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't have any
concept of time in this course.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that-- well,
we'll do a little bit later.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But things happen in reality--
in the financial markets,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they happen very quickly
and then they take time.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
The real side is much slower.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this expansion in
output takes a couple of years,

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's slower.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
The reaction of interest
rate, asset prices, and so on

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:90%
happens over night, instantly.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
When people do analysis of
the impact of monetary policy

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
on financial asset prices,
you look at the small windows,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
minutes around an announcement
or something like that

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
is the impact.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the impact
of monetary policy or prices

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
on real activity, you look
over the span of quarters.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:84%
That's your unit
of-- and you begin

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to see effects a quarter later.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And you keep seeing effects,
you know eight quarters later.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%
So different time scale.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
In this course, we're
not worrying about that.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%
But everything happens at once.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So really, what will
happen in this course

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:84%
is that it won't be
enough to increase

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:90%
money supply to this point.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
In order to have an interest
rate at the final equilibrium

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
level of output,
at this level, I'm

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:84%
going to have to expand
money supply a lot more.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.765 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:52.265 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:52.265 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So again, I can always go
back to my lecture three.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I always-- I
told you that that diagram

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in lecture three was going
to be very important.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
The expansionary effects of an
expansionary monetary policy

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
can be analyzed in the
lecture three diagram,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because there, we take as
given an interest rate.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And now, we know that when we
have a higher interest rate,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
a lower interest rate will
bring this aggregate demand up,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.168 align:middle line:84%
and then we get the multiplier,
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:24:27.168 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.525 align:middle line:90%
So this is a movement in the--

00:24:33.525 --> 00:24:35.508 align:middle line:90%
when monetary policy changes--

00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
that's another thing
that is very important

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:90%
when you do IS-LM analysis.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you ask a
question, the first thing

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
you need to think
about is, which

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
curve is this policy
moving or which

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:90%
curve is this shock moving?

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I know is
that monetary policy--

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
fiscal policy will
always move the IS.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.252 align:middle line:90%
Will it move the LM?

00:24:58.252 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
No, it has nothing to
do with things that

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:90%
happen in financial markets.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that the Fed may not

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
wish to respond to the
fiscal expansion or whatever,

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:84%
but that's a response
that the Fed decides.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not a direct consequence
of the fiscal policy.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal policy is not
bundled with interventions

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:90%
in the financial market.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to that
is monetary policy.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I tell you the Fed decides
to cut interest rate, that's

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:90%
a movement of the LM.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with the IS.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
happens in the IS

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a movement along
the IS, not a shift of the IS.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we saw here.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
When the Fed cut interest rate,
we end up with higher output,

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
but that was a result
of a shift along the IS.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Because monetary policy
is not an IS policy.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:90%
It's an LM policy.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Fiscal policy is an IS policy.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
shifts the IS and not the LM.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So that very important
to understand,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
again, what moves what.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's look at the--

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
anyways, so let me pause here.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
what I just said,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:90%
it's 2/3 of your quiz.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.358 align:middle line:84%
So make sure that
you understand it.

00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you really
understand it--

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.983 align:middle line:84%
obviously we're not going
to ask you exactly this,

00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:29.562 align:middle line:84%
but small perturbations
around what I just said.

00:26:29.562 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can use
this stuff even more.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we understand what the
basic monetary policy does.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to understand
what basic fiscal policy does

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:90%
to the economy.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some scenarios.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:90%
This, I'm calling all in.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:90%
What am I representing there?

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:55.795 align:middle line:90%
In that diagram?

00:26:55.795 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying all
that you see in

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
that diagram is a result
of policy decisions,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.927 align:middle line:90%
macroeconomic policy decisions.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Expansionary
fiscal and monetary policy?

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason I'm
calling it all in.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the case in which both
want to be very expansionary.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you see that the
expansionary monetary policy

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:84%
already sort of increases
equilibrium output.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But then you add to it
expansionary fiscal policy,

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
which moves the IS to the right,
and you further increase output.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with
a big increase

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
in output as a result of
this powerful policy package.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.295 align:middle line:84%
When do you think you may
see situations like that?

00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you see it out
of pure irresponsibility.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.453 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people go to Argentina,
this happens all the time

00:27:55.453 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:90%
for the wrong reasons.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But if in normal times,
normal environments,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.798 align:middle line:90%
when do you think that--

00:28:02.798 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
said "normal times."

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
In normal environments, sort of
with sound macroeconomic policy,

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
when do you think you would
see something like this?

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.705 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.705 --> 00:28:16.055 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Recessions?

00:28:16.055 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Recessions.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest--
during recessions,

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:84%
you need to get the
economy out of the hole.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.433 align:middle line:84%
And then you
probably-- you first

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
try monetary policy
because that's

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
the most direct and quick.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a decision
that can be made overnight.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But often, when the recession
is sufficiently deep,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that's not enough
and you need more.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.405 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
do with fiscal policy.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:41.180 align:middle line:84%
There are other reasons--
there are other differences

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.222 align:middle line:90%
between the two policies.

00:28:42.222 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not looking
under the hood here.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, in
COVID, it was very--

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
a certain group of people were
much more affected than others.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people that
work in restaurants,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
those guys just lost
their jobs and there

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:90%
was nothing they could do.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So there was a reason to
target the transfers-- when

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:84%
you use interest rate, it's a
very blunt policy to everyone.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
When you use fiscal
policy, you can also--

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
it's not only the
amount you spend,

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
but you can also
target the expenditure

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in certain directions.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
other reasons why you

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:90%
may want to use the two tools.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But the main one
is-- the first order

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
one is if you're in
a deep recession,

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
you need everything to try to
lift the economy out of that.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
kind of packages

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
you see in big recessions.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
slide that I think

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I have pending from
two lectures ago.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.697 align:middle line:84%
And this is a good
opportunity to bring it back.

00:29:37.697 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we
looked at equilibrium

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in financial markets,
we came up with

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.078 align:middle line:84%
this downward-sloping
demand, money demand.

00:29:46.078 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we said, well, if
you lower the interest rate,

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
there's more money demand,
and so on, and so forth.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we said,
therefore, the way

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:84%
the Fed lowers interest
rate, or the central bank

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:84%
lowers the interest rate is
by increasing money supply.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The point of this picture is
that there is a limit to that.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And the limit is,
more or less, when

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:90%
the interest rate reaches zero.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
interest rate reaches--

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
the nominal interest
rate reaches zero, then

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
there is no cost
in holding bonds--

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:90%
in holding money, sorry.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.577 align:middle line:84%
The only reason for you
not to hold all your wealth

00:30:22.577 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in the form of money is
because you were giving up

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
some opportunity cost of
investing in bonds, which

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:84%
were inconvenient financial
assets because you couldn't

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
transact with them, but they
pay you higher interest rates.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
you want to go there.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But once you reach zero interest
rate, then you're indifferent

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and you might as well hold.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
If the central bank goes out
there and does an open market

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
operation, you don't need
to be compensated for that

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:84%
because you're totally
willing to hold your wealth

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.930 align:middle line:90%
in the form of money.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And so monetary policy
is no longer effective

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
when you reach what is
called the zero lower bound.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.261 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call
the liquidity trap.

00:31:00.261 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:90%
It's called the liquidity trap.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Let me not get into why.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:90%
But essentially, it's that.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can inject more
and more liquidity,

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot move the interest
rate, so you lost a policy tool.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.115 align:middle line:84%
This was the tragedy of
Japan for many decades.

00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They were stuck against the zero
lower bound, the liquidity trap.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to go through
massive fiscal expansions

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have--
they were in recession,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:84%
chronic recessions, and they
didn't have a very powerful

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
monetary policy tool
because they were

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:90%
against the zero lower bound.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So why did I use this
opportunity to bring this about?

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Because that's, for the reason
I just described, in the case

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of Japan.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But I asked the
question, what would you

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:90%
advise the government to do?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I already
told you the answer.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have an economy
in a recession,

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and this means you use all the
monetary policy that you had,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:84%
conventional monetary
policy that you have-- now

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
we have unconventional
monetary policy,

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
but I'll tell you a little
bit more about that later.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.325 align:middle line:84%
But once you run out of
this and you're still

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
in a recession, what would
you tell the government to do?

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.413 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.413 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Use fiscal policy?

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
You use fiscal policy.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the other
tool that you have.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's a typical
situation you see.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
When countries-- the interest
rates are already very low,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.547 align:middle line:84%
they tend to use much more
actively fiscal policy

00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
policy they have left.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And that has been the
case of Japan, again,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
since the crash of their
financial bubble in the late

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:90%
'80s, early '90s.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So look at the
COVID-19 response.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
to my figure here.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, this is
zero, essentially.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is COVID.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:90%
The COVID shock happened.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the economy was
imploding into a recession.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
The Fed immediately reacted
and cut interest rates very,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:90%
very aggressively to zero.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And then, we were stuck there.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:90%
This is effectively zero.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
technical things--

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the thing moves a little,
but this is effectively zero.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the US was,
during that period,

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:90%
against really a liquid--

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:90%
against the zero lower bound.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
There was no more power for
the kind of monetary policy

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:90%
that we have described here.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.942 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- so that
tells you that there's

00:33:20.942 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
going to have to be
lots of fiscal policy

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:90%
if you want to get out of that.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you that later.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of fiscal policy.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.332 align:middle line:84%
But before getting
there, I'm going

00:33:29.332 --> 00:33:31.665 align:middle line:84%
to show you something that
you don't need to really know

00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
for the quiz, but so
you can understand

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
what is going on in the
newspapers a little better.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The Fed-- that was not
the only-- precisely

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
because the situation with Japan
was so chronic, people began

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to develop lots of
tools, alternative tools

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:84%
for central banks to use
when your interest rate--

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:84%
the main interest rate you
use is stuck against zero,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:90%
against the zero lower bound.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
may have heard--

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it's called sometimes
unconventional monetary policy,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:90%
QE, quantitative easing.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:84%
All those kinds of things, they
represent essentially policies

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that are like monetary
policy, but they are not

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
exactly the way we have--
because they are not

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:84%
interventions in the
very short-term bonds.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
They are interventions in
other assets out there.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
In this course, we
have it very simple.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:90%
We have only one interest rate.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
In reality, there
are multiple bonds.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.540 align:middle line:90%
There are risky bonds.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They're spread.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asks about risky
bonds in a few lectures ago.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:90%
They are spreads.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of interest
rates floating around.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, a central
bank could intervene

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
in those other rates as well.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Japan,
they have even

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.480 align:middle line:84%
intervened in the stock
market, and that tells you

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:90%
how far they can go.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a richer environment
with more financial assets,

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in principle, the Fed could go
beyond the standard short-term

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
bonds that they go for
their open market operation.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
they have been doing.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
A way of thinking about
that is, remember,

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the
monetary-- expansion

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in conventional
monetary policy, we

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
start with a balance
sheet like that.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we said the central
bank has bonds and the money.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If it wants to have an
expansionary monetary policy,

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.830 align:middle line:84%
it goes out there,
it buys more bonds

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and gives them the-- it
gives the bank's money.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.153 align:middle line:84%
And that expands
the balance sheet.

00:35:15.153 --> 00:35:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You end up with
more-- the balance

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.180 align:middle line:84%
sheet of the central bank
ends up with more bonds

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and also with more
liabilities because it

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:84%
gave more money to
people, banks, and so on,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:90%
so it owes more money.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy naturally--
expansionary monetary policy

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:84%
naturally leads to an
expansion of the balance sheet.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, for years,
outside of Japan,

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.890 align:middle line:84%
nobody really cared
too much about that

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:84%
because this effect, relative
to what you saw in the interest

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.437 align:middle line:90%
rate, was very small.

00:35:41.437 --> 00:35:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, the balance
sheet was moving a little bit,

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:90%
but it was mild.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And also here.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:90%
We hit the zero lower bound.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
the Fed went out

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and bought all sorts of things.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, when you hear
QE, quantitative easing, that

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:84%
means mostly that the Fed
goes out there and buys

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.548 align:middle line:84%
not only short-term US Treasury
bonds, but long-term bonds.

00:36:07.548 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there's something
called the term spread.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Typically, interest rates in
the long run are higher than

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:84%
the interest rates in
the short run, typically,

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
controlling for a
bunch of things,

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
the term "premium."

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, they went and bought
those kind of bonds.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
They also bought bonds issued
by Fannie and Freddie--

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Freddie Mac-- no,
Freddie and Fannie,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
mortgage-backed securities,
a bunch of stuff, even loans.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they created a
facility to buy corporate bonds.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
they created a facility

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to buy fallen angels bonds.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Initially, it was only
investment grade bonds, so

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:84%
all the companies that have
the best possible rating.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't enough, so
they went out there and created

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.193 align:middle line:84%
a facility to buy
fallen angels bonds.

00:36:57.193 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Fallen angels were
essentially companies

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.700 align:middle line:84%
that were prime
companies before COVID,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
but after COVID, they didn't
look so good; airlines, cruises,

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that,
hotels, and so on.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So that was a massive
expansion of the balance sheet.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of this,
this guy grew a lot.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.762 align:middle line:84%
But the purpose, that's
like monetary policy.

00:37:19.762 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
unconventional.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.762 align:middle line:84%
It's different from
the standard one,

00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:84%
but they were doing--
trying to operate very much

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:90%
like monetary policy operates.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, you see the
balance sheet of the Fed.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You see, before the
global financial crisis

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:84%
or the Great Recession
of 2008, 2009,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.567 align:middle line:84%
the balance sheet wasn't
an interesting thing

00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to look at for the central bank.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, they did their
regular open market operations

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.322 align:middle line:84%
and for anti-cyclical policy,
but you would see small wiggles

00:37:50.322 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
in the size of the balance
sheet relative to the size

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:90%
of the balance sheet.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.230 align:middle line:84%
In the global
financial crisis, they

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
hit the zero lower bound
for the first time, the US.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there, you saw a massive
expansion of the balance sheet.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:90%
This is the number of assets.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The same happened
to liabilities.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.515 align:middle line:84%
The other side of it is they're
injecting massive amounts

00:38:07.515 --> 00:38:10.006 align:middle line:90%
of money into the economy.

00:38:10.006 --> 00:38:12.465 align:middle line:84%
So there, you saw
a big expansion.

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
The recovery from the
global financial crisis

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:84%
was hard because the financial
sector was very compromised,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.350 align:middle line:90%
so it took them a while.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And they kept doing
this kind of policies.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Then they began to
unwind the balance sheet.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And then COVID came, and that's
what I was showing you before.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Massive expansion.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.795 align:middle line:84%
They sent the
interest rate to zero.

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't enough.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
out and bought

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
lots of other financial
assets, which work

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:90%
very much like monetary policy.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Big thing.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
unwinding the thing.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the
opposite process.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:90%
We have inflation.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We want to get out of this
situation, so they're unwinding.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But you can see
the size of that.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.660 align:middle line:84%
the balance sheet
a couple of decades

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.343 align:middle line:84%
ago was of the order
of $1 trillion,

00:38:58.343 --> 00:39:00.010 align:middle line:84%
which was more or
less of the money that

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:90%
is circulating around.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Now it's $9 trillion.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Massive intervention.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And all central banks, major
central banks look like this.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ECB also
looks like this.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The Bank of Japan
looks like this.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you
don't see these blips

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:84%
as much because they
began to do them here.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.952 align:middle line:84%
So they have been
accumulating for a long time.

00:39:23.952 --> 00:39:25.785 align:middle line:84%
They have been using
these kind of policies.

00:39:25.785 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So coming back
now to the course.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.200 align:middle line:90%
What about fiscal policy?

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm showing you different
countries around the world.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Massive fiscal expansions
during the COVID episode.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Massive.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the US, the fiscal expansion,
if you combine all the packages,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.050 align:middle line:90%
it's of the order of 20% of GDP.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.490 align:middle line:90%
That's huge for fiscal--

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:84%
you don't see things
like this, and this

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:90%
happened almost everywhere.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, you don't see things
like that outside of wars.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.610 align:middle line:84%
This was really like a war,
there's no doubt of that.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The amount of expansionary
fiscal policy we saw

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
was comparable to
what you see in a war.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.755 align:middle line:90%


00:40:07.755 --> 00:40:09.310 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Big recession, huge recession,
massive policy response,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
both monetary of the
conventional and unconventional

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:90%
kind and fiscal.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
not unique to the US.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:84%
It happened
essentially everywhere.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
China is a little
different for reasons

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned
in the first lecture.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But I may talk more
about that later.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, so another policy mix.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.550 align:middle line:90%
This is different.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:90%
So what do we have there?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:84%
That's another policy mix
that we see fairly frequently.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
LM going down, that's
expansionary monetary policy.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.427 align:middle line:84%
IS is going to the left, that's
contractionary fiscal policy.

00:40:57.427 --> 00:40:59.385 align:middle line:84%
So when do you think you
would do such a thing?

00:40:59.385 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Or countries would engage
in things like this?

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What if you wanted
to reduce government spending

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but you wanted to
ward off a recession?

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the conditions
when you want to do this.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
It's called consolidation
of the fiscal deficit.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you have a
large fiscal deficit

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that's leading to accumulation
of public debt, that

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:90%
doesn't look so good.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So the government-- the
Treasury, in the case of the US,

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
may decide that it wants
to reduce fiscal policy

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but is afraid
because in doing so,

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:90%
it's going to cause a recession.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose-- and there is
no problem of output being over

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the fiscal
accounts look very weak.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the situation, that
is if the economy is not going--

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is not going through an
overheating period and so on,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and you want to reduce the
fiscal deficit, in some places,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
it will be explicit, in
some places, implicit.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But the central--
because the central bank

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:84%
has a goal to keep
prices stable and output

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:90%
close to the potential output.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So even if there is no explicit
coordination, if the government

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.550 align:middle line:84%
announced a massive fiscal
consolidation package,

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:84%
say it reduces government
expenditure by 10%,

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.050 align:middle line:84%
the central bank
knows that that's

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:90%
going to cause a recession.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the central
bank naturally

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:84%
will respond by cutting
interest rate to that

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because the recession
is not needed.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
If the US announced today
a fiscal contraction of 5%,

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.795 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure the Fed
would do anything.

00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It will just stay there,
put, because we have

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:90%
an economy that's overheating.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you would do in
a situation in which you want

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to fix the fiscal account
and the economy is

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:90%
more or less at a normal time.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not overheating.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:90%
When will you do the opposite?

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not, when would
you do the opposite?

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It's, when are you likely
to see the opposite?

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
what is the opposite?

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The opposite is a combination
of a fiscal expansion

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.260 align:middle line:90%
with a monetary contraction.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.125 align:middle line:84%
When do you think you
would see such a thing?

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Either maybe when
the government has a budget

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and wants
to increase spending,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.526 align:middle line:90%
or maybe when they--

00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:46.030 align:middle line:90%
the interest rates are too high.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They want to reduce
interest rates.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Yeah.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's true.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.710 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure that that's--

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:01.050 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but that requires a
concerted decision and so on.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:01.900 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.037 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, valid question.

00:44:03.037 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not the one I wanted.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something more
interesting, more exciting,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:13.896 align:middle line:90%
but those are valid answers.

00:44:13.896 --> 00:44:16.187 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: War.

00:44:16.187 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: War?

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:90%
No, war typically is all in.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:25.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me note, I know
it's a strange question,

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:90%
but I know where I'm heading.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the
government decides

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:90%
to spend, for whatever reason.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And the central bank
says, whoa, we don't

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:90%
need that expenditure now.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't need this
fiscal expansion now

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because we're on the
margin of overheating,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to get
this big fiscal expansion.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Then, the Fed, the
central bank, is

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:84%
likely to react to that
and hike interest rate.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.290 align:middle line:84%
That will make very
upset the government.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.548 align:middle line:90%
It always happens.

00:45:00.548 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:90%
The government gets very upset.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.257 align:middle line:84%
And there's a guy
that says, look,

00:45:03.257 --> 00:45:05.953 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to expand the
economy, and you're fighting me.

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:07.495 align:middle line:84%
But that's the nature
of the-- that's

00:45:07.495 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:84%
the reason central banks
are meant to be independent.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where they government--
they can offset that.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wanted to
highlight that example is I

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:84%
think some of that-- and
somebody asked that question,

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the
previous lecture--

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:90%
happened to the US economy.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons we are in
an overheating situation right

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:31.300 align:middle line:84%
now is because the US had a big
fiscal expansion early in 2021.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that fiscal expansion
was, at the time,

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in which there wasn't much
spare capacity in the economy.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So we were very close
to full employment.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The supply side was very
constrained and so on.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there may have been good
reasons for the fiscal package,

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
transfers to people that you
need to transfer and so on.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But the macroeconomic
consequences

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of that very naturally was
going to lead to overheating.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed did not
respond to that.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
reasons people think sometimes

00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.050 align:middle line:90%
that the Fed--

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.840 align:middle line:84%
well, there's no doubt--
exposed that the Fed

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:90%
was behind the curve.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But one of the reasons
they were behind the curve

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.432 align:middle line:84%
is that there was this big
fiscal expansion, which

00:46:10.432 --> 00:46:11.890 align:middle line:84%
naturally was going
to span output,

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.738 align:middle line:90%
and they did not react to it.

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they reacted,
but it took them a long time.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And by then, we had
inflation and all that.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's a
situation in which we

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:84%
should have seen a picture
like the opposite of this,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't see the picture.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see the
monetary part, and that's

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.056 align:middle line:84%
the reason we ended up with an
economy that is overheating.

00:46:30.056 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah?

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Did the
Fed ever elaborate on

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:90%
why they didn't do it?

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
I mean, it's always--

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.015 align:middle line:84%
it's a very uncertain
environment here.

00:46:42.015 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they thought
this was going

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to be very
transitory, that there

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.520 align:middle line:84%
was enough
inflationary dynamics,

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.910 align:middle line:84%
dis-inflationary dynamics,
that would offset all that,

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.358 align:middle line:84%
exposed it obviously it was
a mistake, but it's exposed.

00:46:54.358 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a
lot of noise and so on.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Then, the came the Russian
war that sort of increased

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the price of oil dramatically,
and that sort of created lots

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:90%
of bad dynamics.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So they were unlucky.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.895 align:middle line:84%
That part is the part
that I think that--

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.270 align:middle line:84%
again, they thought
we were going

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:14.910 align:middle line:90%
through a temporary situation.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.243 align:middle line:84%
They didn't think that it was
going to be strong enough.

00:47:17.243 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:84%
They thought the supply side
was going to expand a lot faster

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:90%
than it did.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So they may have been
right in not fighting it,

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.400 align:middle line:84%
but over a horizon
of three years.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And they found everything very
compressed into three months,

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and that led to a problem.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.766 align:middle line:84%
So the last thing
I want to show you

00:47:35.766 --> 00:47:42.312 align:middle line:84%
is that this model-- how
this model works in practice.

00:47:42.312 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, you're
not going to estimate

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:90%
exactly the model I show you.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You have a real model, we'll
have dynamics and many more

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But the more complete version
of what I just showed you,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:84%
the IS-LM I showed you, many
people have estimated sort of--

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:05.300 align:middle line:84%
for example, I've estimated
the response of the economy

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to monetary shocks, or to
fiscal expansion, and so on.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And they trace out different
dynamics, different variables,

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and check whether that's
consistent with the IS-LM

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:16.680 align:middle line:90%
framework or not.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And the point of this
figure is that it

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:19.887 align:middle line:90%
is very consistent with that.

00:48:19.887 --> 00:48:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But let me show you a
little bit about time.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is the effect
on different variables

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of a surprise increase in
the federal funds rate.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the monetary policy rate.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Federal funds rate is the
interest rate that the Fed sets.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And where you see that
in practice, what you see

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.650 align:middle line:84%
is this is the impact on
retail sales, on sales output,

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:90%
really, more or less.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.763 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, in
practice, the output

00:48:45.763 --> 00:48:46.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't respond immediately.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.480 align:middle line:90%
It takes a while.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.770 align:middle line:90%
It takes several quarters.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:90%
But eventually, it hits you.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the big issues
with monetary policy today

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:57.090 align:middle line:84%
is that clearly, inflation
is not under control,

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.650 align:middle line:90%
but they have done a lot.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it takes
time for the economy

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.818 align:middle line:84%
to really perceive the full
impact of a monetary policy.

00:49:06.818 --> 00:49:08.985 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the tension
now because lots of people

00:49:08.985 --> 00:49:11.220 align:middle line:84%
are pushing the Fed to
do more because we still

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.070 align:middle line:84%
have 6% inflation, but
they have done a lot.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And they know that monetary
policy works with lags.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.140 align:middle line:84%
"With long and variable
lags" is a famous sentence.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes about six
quarters to really see the mess,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.640 align:middle line:90%
how much mess has been caused.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It will take a while,
so we have to see.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You see, output, well,
it's more like sales.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Initially, they trend
slowly, but it takes a while,

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.130 align:middle line:84%
but it does have a
very large effect.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.600 align:middle line:90%
This is employment.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.145 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:49:38.145 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.350 align:middle line:90%
These diagrams, you don't--

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:90%
well, this is unemployment.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, the other
side of it is--

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.500 align:middle line:84%
unemployment also
will build up slowly.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.080 align:middle line:90%
So unemployment is very low now.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know when
the economy really

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.490 align:middle line:84%
feels the impact of
all the monetary policy

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:84%
has been done in the
last eight months or so.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Where will unemployment end?

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.843 align:middle line:84%
And the big problem
for the Fed today

00:50:03.843 --> 00:50:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is something that you
don't need to understand

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.680 align:middle line:84%
until the second
part of the course

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.230 align:middle line:84%
is that prices do
decline eventually,

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:90%
but it takes a long time.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So to control inflation
with monetary policy,

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.540 align:middle line:90%
it takes a while, a long time.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's see whether the economy,
consumers, and so on have

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.690 align:middle line:90%
the patience to hang in there.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:35.000 align:middle line:90%
