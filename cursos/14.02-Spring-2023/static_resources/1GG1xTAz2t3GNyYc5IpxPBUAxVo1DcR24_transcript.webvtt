RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
OK, so let me

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:84%
continue with the topic of
the previous lecture, which

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:90%
is asset pricing.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And we said the tricky
thing with asset pricing

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the payoff of having
an asset comes in the future.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And that implies at
least two things.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that we need to
have a method to value returns

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:90%
in the future as of today, OK?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So what is it equivalent to?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
After all, if you want
to buy a financial asset,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
you need to pay for it
today with dollars of today,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and you are expected to receive
some payoff in the future.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to
compare these two things.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
that-- is related,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:84%
is that because this
payoff is in the future,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
you need to have
expectations about it.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two
concepts we play with.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a third
related concept,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:84%
which is, because it
comes in the future,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
many things can
happen in between.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there is also
a concept of risk.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
elements we discussed.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.357 align:middle line:90%
And remember, we did--

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go very
quickly over what

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we did in the previous lecture
because I could see some faces.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me go quickly over that
and then continue with equity,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%
which was the next step.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So the first step says, OK,
ignore the expectations part

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:90%
for now and risk and so on.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Assume that you know the future.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And we ask the question, well,
how do we value $1 next year?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
In particular, we
want the question,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is it equivalent
to having $1 today?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
quickly became no,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
because imagine that you
had the dollar today.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Then you can invest
it for a year,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
and you get the return of the
one-year interest rate return.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So with a $1 today, you can do
more than with $1 in the future.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that
calculation gave us

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
the exact recipe to valuing $1
in the future, because in order

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to get $1 in the future,
I don't need $1 today.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I need 1 over 1 plus
the interest rate.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I invest this in
the one-year bond,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and I get a return of
that over that amount.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
That gives me exactly
$1 in the future, OK?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us a very natural
way of valuing $1 next year.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just 1 over 1
plus the interest rate.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the same logic,
if I have $1 today,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and I want to invest
it for two years,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to
earn that interest

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:90%
rate for the first year.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to earn that interest

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
rate on the full product,
not on the original $1.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
On the 1 plus i t dollars, I'm
going to earn 1 plus i t plus 1.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I can generate a lot of--

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] if the interest rate
is 10% on average, $1 today

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
generates $1.21
two years from now.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you, by the
same logic, that 1 over $1.21

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
today is equivalent
to $1 in the future.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So then we said, let's
pick a very general asset,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:90%
an asset that has--

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that pays Zt dollars
this year, then Zt

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
plus $1 one year from now,
Zt plus $2 two years from now

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so forth,
up to n years ahead.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
What is the value
of that asset today?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, you apply
exactly the same logic

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that we apply here for every
single year in the future.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:90%
And you get-- that's the--

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that's called the
present discounted value

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:90%
of those cash flows.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:90%
That gives you the value today.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Present, discounted-- those are
the discount factors, 1 over--

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and then that's the value
that you get out of that.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
So that asset has that
present discounted value

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of future cash flows.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And that should be
more or less the price

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that you are willing to
pay for that asset, OK?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.605 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we introduce
expectations.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, but we're talking about
cash flows in the future.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:90%
In many cases, we don't know.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know two things.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
First, we don't know where
the cash flows may be.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
In a very safe bond, you
do know the cash flow.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] But in
almost any other asset,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
you don't know exactly the
cash flows you receive.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know what
the future interest rate,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:90%
one-year interest rate will be.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So that took us to the concept
of expected present discounted

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
value, in which you just
replace all the things

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we don't know today for the
expectations of those things.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know the
cash flows in the future.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason-- we
have an expectation.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what you put there.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.665 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know the future--
we know the current interest

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
rate, but we don't know the
future one-year interest rate

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
or two-year interest rate,
end-year interest rate

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So we put an
expectation there, OK?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I gave you
some special cases.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a case in which the
interest rate is constant.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a case in which
the payoff in the future,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
the coupons, are constant.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's a case in
which both are constant,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the interest rate and
the payoffs in the future

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and for a bond-- for a
financial asset that lasts for n

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
years, that matures in n years.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the case in which an
asset that does not mature,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that goes on forever
under these conditions.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, suppose that we

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
look at the x dividend price.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That means after this year's
dividend or this year's payment,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:90%
then that's the value.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I made the point there
that shows immediately

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
something that will be present
in almost any asset price, which

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.635 align:middle line:84%
is, as interest rate goes down,
asset values tend to go up, OK?

00:06:21.635 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is because assets

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:90%
pay something in the future.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And if the interest
rate falls, then you

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:90%
discount less the future.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.328 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you're
going to receive

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:34.515 align:middle line:84%
is valued more because you
discount less the future, OK?

00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's the effect.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in this
particular case,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.108 align:middle line:84%
if the interest rate goes
to 0, the value of that

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity because you
don't discount the future,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to receive
infinite payments in the future,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we look at the
specific financial assets.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And we first look at bonds.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.842 align:middle line:84%
And we said one important
distinction, something--

00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
whenever you buy a bond, one
of the things you want to know

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
is the maturity of that bond.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it a one-year bond, a
two-year bond, five, 10, 30?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are the typical US
Treasury bonds, at least.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
You want to know the
maturity of the bond.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So then we went into
pricing different bonds.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:90%
We say, well, a bond--

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the simplest bond is a bond--
is a one-year bond that--

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
suppose we have a bond that pays
$100 at the end of the year,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:90%
and then it matures.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the price of
that bond should

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:84%
be the present discounted value
of the flows of that bond, which

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is $100 divided by 1 plus
the one-year interest

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
rate at time t, OK?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.913 align:middle line:84%
And notice again here,
by the same logic

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
of what I explained before,
is that, if the interest

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
rate, one-year interest rate,
goes up, the price of that bond

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.417 align:middle line:84%
will decline because that bond
pays you one year from now.

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And one year from now, when
the interest rate is higher,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
it's worth a little less
than it was when the interest

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:90%
rate was a little lower, OK?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at a two-year
bond, a bond that pays nothing

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:90%
up to two years from now.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well, two years
from now, it pays $100

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and then matures.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the price of that
bond will be this, OK?

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And notice that, in
this case, the price

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
of a two-year bond
at time t goes down

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
if either of the one-year
rates goes up, OK?

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It can be the first--

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
this year's one-year rate
or maybe the expectation

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that the one-year rate
next year will go up, OK?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Then I introduce an
important concept,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
which is this concept of
arbitrage pricing, which is--

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.275 align:middle line:84%
two instruments
should give you sort

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
of the same interest
rate-- we're leaving

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
risk considerations aside.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It should give you the same
return when you compare them

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:90%
over the same maturity, OK?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
example, I said,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
look, a one-year bond
and a two-year bond

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that you invest-- you
hold for only one year

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
should give you more or
less the same return, OK?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So that means that this is the
return you get from $1 invested

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:90%
in a one-year bond--

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
should be equal
to the return you

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
get by investing
in a two-year bond

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and selling that
bond after one year.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
expression we had here.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
If you-- this is what you
pay for a two-year bond.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you expect
to be paid for that bond when

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
you sell it one year from now.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Notice that, one year from
now, the two-year bond

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.743 align:middle line:84%
will be a one-year bond because
one year will have expired,

00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and at that point, it
will be a one-year bond.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason we have
a subscript P1t here.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So that means that we
can solve from here

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that P2t is simply that.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
expression like the one

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
we had for the one-year
bond at time t.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
There is one for t plus 1.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We put expectations because we
don't know the actual interest

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:90%
rate in the future.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I stuck
this into there.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And we got exactly
the same price

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that we got with
the net present--

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
expected present discounted
value approach, OK?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
And so this asset pricing--

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
this arbitrage way
of pricing things

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
is an incredibly
powerful tool that

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
is used very
extensively in finance.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:90%
These are simple calculations.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But when an asset gets to be
tricky, much more complicated,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:90%
this is very useful.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Then we talk about bond yields.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And bond yields are defined
as the constant interest

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
rate that is consistent
with the current price

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:90%
of that particular bond.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of
the two-year bond,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
we call the two-year
rate, that interest rate

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that is constant
over the two periods.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason I square it.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not i1t times 1 i1t plus 1.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I square it.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not constant over time.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The two-year interest
rate may be moving a lot.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.438 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Fed just
hiked by 25 basis points.

00:11:35.438 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure all the rates
are moving at this moment.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So the rates can be moving
at all points in time.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.733 align:middle line:84%
But what we define as the
yield is, at one point in time,

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
you tell me the
price of the bond,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you tell me the payoff
of the bond, then

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
what is the constant interest
rate that makes this price--

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
this expression equal
to the actual price?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we define
the two-year rate.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the two-year rate.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a bond that
pays 100 n years from now,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
then there would be a
constant interest rate, i n,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:17.265 align:middle line:84%
that gives you $100 divided
by 1 plus i nt to the n power.

00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:90%
That will give you--

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
when you set that equal to
the price, the actual price

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of the bond, the one you get out
of expected present discounted

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
value or out of
arbitrage, then you

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
have found the yield or
the yield to maturity.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We know what the-- we
already got the price

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.272 align:middle line:90%
from the previous slide.

00:12:38.272 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
price of this bond

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to be 100 as
a two-year bond divided

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
by this product of 1 plus
interest rate, one-year interest

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So this has to be equal to that.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the way, actually, you
calculate the two-year yield.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:90%
And numerators are the same.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
That means the denominators
have to be the same.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And this implies approximately
that the two-year rate

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.312 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of average of the
expected one-year rates, OK?

00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
the two-year rate

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of average
of the one-year rate.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
That means that, when the--
when you expect the interest

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
rate to be-- the one-year
rate to be rising over time,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.928 align:middle line:84%
then the two-year rate will be
above the one-year rate today.

00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
That's when the curve is-- we
say the curve, the yield curve,

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
is steep.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.342 align:middle line:90%
Remember I showed you this in--

00:13:27.342 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
When the curve looks
like that, so steep,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.638 align:middle line:84%
means that the later--
the two-year rate,

00:13:41.638 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
the three-year-- well,
here, in particular,

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the three-year rate
is-- the two-year rate

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.085 align:middle line:84%
is higher than
the one-year rate.

00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:49.252 align:middle line:84%
The three-year rate is
higher than the two-year rate

00:13:49.252 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
That happens when you expect--

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
the market expects
the interest rate

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to be rising over
time, the one-year rate

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to be rising because
remember, the two-year rate

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:84%
is the average of the
current one-year rate

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
plus the expected one-year
rate one year from now.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
For that average to be higher
than the one-year rate now,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
it has to be the case that the
expected one-year rate one year

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
from now has to be higher than
the current one-year rate, OK?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's when you tend to get--

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.085 align:middle line:84%
that's when you get an
upward-sloping term structure.

00:14:25.085 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you get a
downward-sloping term structure,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
which is the way it
looks right now--

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
actually, right now, it
looks very downward-sloping.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It looks very
downward-sloping-- is

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
people expect that we're getting
to the peak of current policy

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
rate of short-term
interest rate.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so people expect now
for the interest rate

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:90%
to decline going forward.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
the two-year rate now is

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:90%
lower than the one-year rate.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And the five-year rate is
lower than the two-year rate

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see
here, it's very steep.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we said, well, let's
add risk because yeah, sure.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Here we assume that you were
indifferent between investing

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.007 align:middle line:84%
in a completely safe one-year
bond and a two-year bond

00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
in which you had to make an
expectation about the price.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But that price
could move around.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So there is risk on that price,
on the price of one-year--

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
the one-year bond as of today.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.612 align:middle line:90%
So we added risk.

00:15:32.612 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
types of risk in bonds.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
One is default risk, that they
had promised that they would pay

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you $100, but it may happen that
they cannot pay you the $100,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
the corporation or the
government or so on.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Argentina defaults its bonds
regularly, for example.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Many of the regional
banks that have gone under

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
will default on
their bonds as well--

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:90%
so that kind of risk.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But we'll remove that risk, and
we'll focus, for now, on the--

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to focus
mostly on the price risk

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to be talking
mostly about US Treasury bonds.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
US Treasury bonds have no
default risk, we think.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there could be an
event in a few weeks from now,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
but no one expects that
to be a lasting event.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it is,
there is a real mess.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, but
there is also a price risk

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
because you have to hold this
and then sell it at one year.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know exactly the
price, what the price will be.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a risk
associated to that.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, really,
you shouldn't equalize

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
the return on the one-year
bond to the return you expect

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:90%
to get in the two-year bond.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
You should add a
little compensation

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
for holding the two-year bond,
for going the two-year bond

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:90%
route.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than
expect to make

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
1 plus i1t the two-year
bond after one year,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
you should expect to
earn a little more.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this xb
being positive reflects.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in that case, the
price of the two-year bond

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is a little different
from what we had.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a
little lower than what

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
we had because that's the
way you compensate for risk.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
I sell you an instrument
a little cheaper

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
than it would have been
in the absence of risk.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So you expect to get a little--
a slightly higher return out

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So this price is lower than
the price without the risk

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:90%
premium here, no?

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
That means-- but it
still is promising you

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
$100 So that's exactly how
you get more return out of it,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
because you're buying
something at a lower price, OK?

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:43.865 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.865 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So I can do the same
logic now and see

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:90%
what the two-year rate is.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:90%
But now that I have this--

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
take into account
this risk, and you

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
have that the two-year rate
now is the average not only

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
of the expected one-year
rate, but also includes

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:02.146 align:middle line:90%
a risk premium.

00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to be the
case, that the further out

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
in the curve you are, the
larger is the risk premium.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.162 align:middle line:84%
It's called term premium because
term is the same as maturity,

00:18:11.162 --> 00:18:11.662 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:11.662 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, sometimes that
is negative, actually.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And recently, up to very
recently-- now it's positive.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.332 align:middle line:84%
But until very recently,
that xb was negative.

00:18:28.332 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that-- you
don't need to understand that

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is because long-term
bonds were great hedges.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, if there is--

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
for any major event, for a
financial crisis or something

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
like that, because
in a financial crisis

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
or a major disaster,
interest rates tend to fall.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.855 align:middle line:84%
And when interest rates fall,
the price of bonds goes up,

00:18:51.855 --> 00:18:53.706 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] OK?

00:18:53.706 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
And so that was a good hedge.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to protect
your portfolio of equities

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and so on against a major
catastrophic-- major event

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
like a financial crisis
or a war or something

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
like that, it was not a bad
idea to have some long-term US

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Treasury bonds in
your portfolio,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
because they would tend to go
up precisely when everything

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
else was going to be losing
money and so, as a result,

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%
tend to be negative.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not the case, because
now one of the biggest risks

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:90%
is inflation.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if there is an
inflationary spike,

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
then interest rates will
go down-- up, not down.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And that means the price
of bonds will decline.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So they will decline
at the wrong time, OK?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So the price of bonds,
of long-term bonds,

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
now will tend to decline
when everything else is also

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:90%
plummeting.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we get a negative,
if we get an inflation surprise,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and inflation is a lot
higher than people expected,

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
asset prices are going
to decline, all of them,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
including long-term bonds.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
now this xb is positive.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's-- so I
think that's where we were

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:90%
at in the previous lecture.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Any questions about that?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to-- next
step is to talk about equity.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why don't we add the
risk premium to the interest

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:90%
rate on your note?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.893 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.893 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
Well, because next year,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that one-- for this
particular bond, that bond

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
will have no risk because
it will be one year to go.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that year,
you're going to get the $100.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:90%
So there is no risk, that $100.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.505 align:middle line:84%
If it was a
three-year bond, then

00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
you would have--
in two of those,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.192 align:middle line:90%
you would have risk premium.

00:20:36.192 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't have
it in the last one,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
because in the last one,
you don't have the-- you're

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.993 align:middle line:90%
going to receive the $100.

00:20:40.993 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:90%
If the bond could default--

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because I'm only looking
at price risk in the bond.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
If the bond could default, then
I would add an extra term there

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's default risk.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But here I'm just
looking at price risk.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming the
unit of time is one year.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So just one year
before it expires,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
there is no more risk because
there is no price in between,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to receive
$100 at the end of a year.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:90%
In reality, time is continuous.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.597 align:middle line:84%
So every second, there is
a little bit of a risk.

00:21:17.597 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So you have a little bit
of that risk all the time

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:90%
except for the last second.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking at a simple
example, where things

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.928 align:middle line:90%
happen every one year only.

00:21:27.928 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I think
they mess up, actually.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
They put the risk premium
in the wrong place.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.992 align:middle line:90%
There was another question.

00:21:39.992 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
stock prices now.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.845 align:middle line:84%
So stock prices have two key
differences with respect to--

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
well, several differences, but
two that I want to highlight.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
The first is that they don't
pay coupons, fixed amount.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't promise you
to pay $100 two years

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%
from now or anything like that.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:90%
They pay dividends.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
They tell you we have a
policy of paying dividends.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And even different companies
differentiate themselves

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
by how much they promise to give
you on average in dividends.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.207 align:middle line:84%
But it's a promise that, if
everything goes as planned,

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:90%
they'll pay you those dividends.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.017 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It's not a commitment
to pay you a dividend.

00:22:28.017 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very different from a bond.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
A bond says, I'll pay you a
coupon of this amount every six

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't pay that
coupon, that's a default.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
like that in equity.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Equity, you buy shares
of Apple, and you

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:84%
look at the history
of dividends,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
what the CEO tells you the
last time, in the last release.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.448 align:middle line:84%
And you think, OK,
these are more or less

00:22:51.448 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
going to be my dividends.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:90%
But there's no commitment.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
They will always tell
you what's their plan.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's a plan.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not a commitment.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.717 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have fixed coupons
or anything like that.

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no commitment.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, there
is no sense of default,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:90%
because there was no commitment.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So there is no default.
If a company has

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to cut dividends to 0,
that's not a default.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
That's conditions change.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:90%
There was no commitment to that.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:84%
The second feature is that they
don't have a fixed terminal

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:90%
date.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
99.9999999% of the bonds
do have a terminal date.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:90%
They have a maturity.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a few exceptions, which
are called perpetuities, that--

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the US has
none, for example.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But most bonds have
a maturity, OK?

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Equity doesn't come that way.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Nobody tells you buy
a share of Apple.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't buy
shares of Apple that

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
will be retired 30
years from now, OK?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
There will be there as
long as Apple exists.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.878 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.878 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you had shares
of First Republic Bank,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you have nothing now
[CHUCKLES] because that--

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but that was not
the original plan.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It First Republic Bank
had been more successful,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.325 align:middle line:90%
you would have--

00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
the shares would have survived
for a very long period of time.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's no sense of maturity.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.105 align:middle line:84%
In principle, equity
can last forever.

00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use
arbitrage to price equity.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- so it lets
me have the following

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
portfolio of options here.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:90%
One is our old one-year bond.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can invest your dollar
today in a one-year bond.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The alternative,
I'm going to say,

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:90%
there is some equity out there.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call the
price of that equity Q

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.832 align:middle line:84%
and the dividend of
that equity D, OK?

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So this price is a
stock by arbitrage.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
So equity is risky.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's much
riskier than bonds

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
unless you are into Argentinian
bonds or things like that.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it's much
riskier than bonds.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is always
a risk premium.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that
in itself is a trade,

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
should trade at risk
premium of equity market.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to put an xs here.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So what do you expect
to get from holding--

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
arbitrage means the
same holding period.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to compare
investing in a one-year safe

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
bond versus buying equity
today, buying a stock,

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
holding it for a year,
And then selling it there

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:90%
because that's the same--

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I cannot do arbitrage depending
from different holding periods.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a one-year
holding period.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying this is what I'm
going to get from the bond.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to require some
risk compensation for that

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:90%
because risk equity is risky.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to want that.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I'm going to get.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
That's my return
on equity I get.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm going to
pay today for the stock--

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:90%
say, for a share of Apple.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I get this,
this is the dividend

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I expect to get at
the end of the year.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
the price at which

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I expect to sell that share
one year from now, OK?

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
return I'm expecting

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to get from holding the share
of Apple for one period.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I need
to compare with holding

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:90%
for one year, one-year bond.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But I want also to be
compensated for a risk, OK?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:47.665 align:middle line:90%
Is this clear?

00:26:47.665 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
silence means yes or no.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- we did
something like this

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
with the two-year bond,
except that we didn't

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
have a dividend
there, because there

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:90%
was no coupon that they won.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We only had a final
payment of 100.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But we did this already when
we compared the one-year bond

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
with holding the two-year
bond for one period.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
We had exactly that,
except that there

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:84%
was-- the expected
dividend. there

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
was 0 because there
was no payment

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:90%
at the intermediate date, OK?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:90%
So we know this concept already.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
here is, again,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that there is expected
dividend and, second,

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have a risk premium
here, which we added for bonds.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But for equities, I
said, it's typically

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
much larger than for
bonds, especially if you're

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.755 align:middle line:90%
talking about Treasury bonds.

00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to reorganize
this to solve out

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.445 align:middle line:90%
for the price, this Qt here.

00:27:45.445 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
to figure out,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
what is the price of
the share of Apple, OK?

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can reorganize this,
which means move to the left,

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
divide these two guys here
by 1 plus i1t plus xs,

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and I get this.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:08.777 align:middle line:84%
So the price is equal to the
discounted expected dividend--

00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I have to discount
it because I expect

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to receive it one year from now,
and I want also compensation

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:90%
for risk--

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
plus the discounted
value of the money

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get from selling
the share of Apple one

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
year from now, which I also
discount by the interest rate,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but also with a risk
premium because that's

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
a risky investment.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we have.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Now notice that, at t plus
1, I will have an expression

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:90%
like that as well, again.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
When we did the
two-year bond, we

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
didn't have an expression like
that, because after one year,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
the two-year bond was going
to be a one-year bond.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And so we didn't need to think--

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:90%
put a price there.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:90%
We just put the $100, OK?

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Here is different because we
said this equity never expires.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Unless the company goes
bankrupt, it's there.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So in the next date, I'm going
to have an expression exactly

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to have an
expected dividend at t plus 2

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and the expected price at t
plus 2 and so on and so forth.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
That means I can replace
this expression here

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.795 align:middle line:84%
by an expression like this
shifted all by one year.

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I can keep doing that.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
If I do that, I'm
going to get, then, two

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
expected divisions here, and
then I'm going to get a--

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to get
something like this,

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:84%
but shifted by one year
and discounted by two terms

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in the denominator.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
get an expected Qt plus 2

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
around here, OK?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can do a substitution
of that, as well, again,

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
by everything shifted
by two years and so on.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:90%
So I can keep going.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I can keep going and going
and going and going on forever.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep doing
it, you're going

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to end up with an
expression that gives you

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
the price of the asset as the
expected present discounted

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
value of all the future
dividends you expect.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm summing here,
Dt plus 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't stop here.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It stop here, I'm going to
have here a Qet plus n plus 1.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can replace
that thing again.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can keep going
and keep going forever.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to integrate the
expected dividends, discounted

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:90%
expected dividends, to infinity.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, each future dividend
is discounting more and more

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.195 align:middle line:84%
heavily because the
denominator is growing

00:30:56.195 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and growing and growing because
it's further out in the future.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.022 align:middle line:90%
It's worth less and less, OK?

00:31:01.022 --> 00:31:03.200 align:middle line:90%
But still, it can go on forever.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even if you
substitute this stuff a million

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:84%
times, there is
going to still be

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
a little price at
the very end floating

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.790 align:middle line:90%
around [LAUGHS] discounted.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It will never go away.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:90%
So it never ends.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
There is no maturity.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.670 align:middle line:90%
They keep going, OK?

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we did everything
up to now for nominal--

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:90%
in nominal terms you can do it--

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason I didn't
want to spend much time with it.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You can do everything
in real terms as well.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And all that happens there
is just remove the dollars,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and just be careful to
replace the nominal interest

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
rate by the real interest
rate-- but nothing deep there.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I can-- you can go to real
pricing, nominal pricing,

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But the important
concept is not that.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the fact that this--

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in principle-- we call that, by
the way, the fundamental value

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of equity or of a stock.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the expected
present discounted

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.453 align:middle line:90%
value of all the dividends.

00:32:07.453 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have to discount it
by the appropriate discounting

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:84%
factor, which includes
interest rate and risk premium.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we call,
typically, fundamentals.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.777 align:middle line:84%
And we differentiate that
from what we call sometimes--

00:32:17.777 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you an
example later on bubbles,

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:84%
when the price seems to
exceed any reasonable sense

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of fundamentals.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me sort of start
going back to things that we

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:90%
worry about in this course.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's a big issue.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.977 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what is
happening to markets now.

00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
What the Fed did was
very anticipated.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But markets often find a
way to react to things,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
even if things were anticipated.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.677 align:middle line:84%
What happens-- so let me ask
you a following question.

00:33:01.677 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
What is the effect--
what do you think

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is the effect of an expansionary
monetary policy on the asset

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:84%
prices we have discussed,
so bonds and equity?

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with bonds first.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.142 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the effect
of an expansionary monetary

00:33:19.142 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:84%
policy-- that means a
reduction in the interest

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:84%
rate-- on the price of your
one-year bond, two-year bond,

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.425 align:middle line:90%
any year, you pick?

00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:30.133 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.675 align:middle line:84%
We already talked
about that earlier.

00:33:31.675 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Goes up.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
The price of a bond is inversely
related to the interest rate

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because if I cut an
interest rate, it means--

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
a bond is something that pays--
the payoff is in the future.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:84%
That thing in the
future is worth more

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:90%
if the interest rate goes down.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
There is less discounting of it.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So the price of the
bond, any bond here,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
will go up, the one-year,
two-year, three-year, five-year.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:90%
All of them will go up--

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
assuming that nothing changes as
a result of the monetary policy.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
sometimes markets think,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
oops, the Fed messed up.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to lots of
changes in all the term

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
structure and things
like that because they

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
expect the market to
react in strange ways

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:90%
to this mistake made by the Fed.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But here I'm saying,
suppose that the Fed just

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.080 align:middle line:84%
cuts the interest rate
once, and everyone

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
believes that the Fed will
continue to do so and so on.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you're
going to get that--

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the price of bonds will go up.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to
the price of stocks?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you want to answer.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.952 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:39.952 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: It would go up.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Up.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:84%
But-- well, but it's important
to say that it will go up

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:90%
probably for two reasons.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:90%
The first one is that--

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
it's also the case that a lot of
the price of an equity, actually

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
even more so than a bond,
has to do with expected

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:90%
payoffs in the future.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I lower interest rates,
just the effect of discounting

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
will tend to raise
the price of--

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
so even if I don't change
the expected dividends

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.690 align:middle line:84%
at all, the fact that the
interest rate goes down,

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
for the same reason that
the price of a bond went up,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the price of equity
will tend to go up, OK?

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly--
it's the same logic.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's an extra kick here
for equity, which is what?

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
That bones did not
have, but equity does.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
At least it's an equity
that is positively

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.663 align:middle line:90%
related to aggregate activity.

00:35:35.663 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
I'm assuming here.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.503 align:middle line:90%


00:35:42.503 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] bond
is [INAUDIBLE] fixed amount

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:84%
before stocks and can't
guarantee that pays you

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
the same dividend.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Well,
yeah, that's the logic.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.537 align:middle line:84%
Here, the expansionary
monetary policy

00:35:58.537 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:90%
is cutting interest rates.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But as a result of that,
output is going up.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
When output is going up, sales
will go up, revenues will go up,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
dividends will
probably go up as well.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So monetary policy can
have very large effect.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people in financial
markets are looking at the Fed

00:36:14.163 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:84%
all the time
[CHUCKLES] because it

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
can have a big impact on
the price of those assets.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And on equity, in particular,
it can be very strong.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's one of the
ways monetary policy works.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
When the Fed cuts
interest rates,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:84%
it inflates the value
of asset prices.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And that creates more wealth.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.072 align:middle line:84%
People feel richer,
consume more, blah,

00:36:37.072 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.535 align:middle line:90%
Firms feel also richer.

00:36:39.535 --> 00:36:41.570 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They
invest more and so on.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
That's deliberate, in a sense.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
main mechanisms

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:84%
through which monetary policy
affects aggregate demand.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:90%
It just creates wealth.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And when there's too
much demand, too much

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:84%
aggregate demand,
like is going on now--

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that's the reason we
have inflation and so on.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
In 2022, the Fed went out
and deliberately destroyed

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
wealth [CHUCKLES] because that's
what [INAUDIBLE] Raise interest

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.900 align:middle line:84%
rates a lot, the price
of equity came down,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.215 align:middle line:90%
even houses began to wobble.

00:37:12.215 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The price of Treasury
bonds sort of collapsed

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth, OK?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Another experiment that we did
sort of early on, lecture 3, 4,

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
around there is what
happens-- what do you think

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
happens when there is an
increase in consumer spending?

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:90%
So suppose that now--

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.750 align:middle line:84%
remember, we had a C0
floating around, an autonomous

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:90%
consumption component.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.745 align:middle line:84%
And so suppose
that that goes up.

00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happens to asset prices?

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.957 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big issue
these days, actually.

00:37:49.957 --> 00:37:52.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: That depends on how
the Federal Reserve reacts

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to it by raising or
lowering interest rates.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: Exactly.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:90%
It depends a lot--

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when financial markets
receive news-- every day,

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:84%
they are releases of news
of all sorts of things.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And in financial markets,
they-- people always

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.830 align:middle line:90%
think, OK, this is the news.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:84%
The obvious thing
for this is good news

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:84%
because this will tend
to increase output.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Output will increase dividends.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing for stocks.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But the immediate reaction
is, whoa, but what will

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:90%
the Fed do about this?

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Does the Fed like that we have
more aggregate demand or not?

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.166 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] OK?

00:38:32.166 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's key here.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that, in this
case, the Fed did not like--

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the Fed-- like today,
the Fed doesn't want

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:90%
more aggregate demand today.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no central bank around
the world-- maybe in China,

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
but there's no
other central bank

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:55.305 align:middle line:84%
around the world that wants
more aggregate demand, OK?

00:38:55.305 --> 00:39:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So if the release is consumer
are very bullish now,

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.330 align:middle line:90%
that's not good news.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the financial markets
immediately are saying, uh-oh,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:84%
we have a Fed that is
watching for inflation.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.850 align:middle line:84%
This means they're going
to hike interest rates, OK?

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to the price of
bonds, then, in this environment

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
when C0 goes up, and
the Fed doesn't like it,

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and the markets know that
the Fed doesn't like it?

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The Fed may take a
month to react to it.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But markets react
immediately, say, whoa, this

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.956 align:middle line:84%
is what the Fed will
do one month from now.

00:39:31.956 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think happens
to the price of bonds?

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:39.490 align:middle line:84%
If we get news that
consumers are very bullish,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that we also
have inflation of 4% or so.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:48.123 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the Fed doesn't
like more aggregate demand.

00:39:48.123 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you think will
happen to the price of bonds?

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, [CHUCKLES] again, The
news happened, say, a week ago.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And the Fed moves
one week later.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So markets are going to
anticipate that, in this case,

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the Fed will hike
interest rates.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.818 align:middle line:84%
If the Fed-- if the
markets anticipate

00:40:15.818 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that the Fed will
hike interest rate,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.815 align:middle line:84%
interest rates will go up
immediately-- not the rate

00:40:20.815 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that the Fed controls,
but the one-year rate,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.357 align:middle line:84%
the two-year rate,
the three-month rate.

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
All those rates are going
to go up immediately

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.865 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that, OK?

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And that, we know, reduces
the price of bonds.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Bonds and interest rates
are-- the price of a bond

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and the interest rates
are inversely related.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So the anticipation that
the Fed will hike rates

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:84%
will lead to higher interest
rates at all horizons.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And that will reduce
the price of bonds, OK?

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So this thing that--
and for equity,

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
well, look what happened
for equity here.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, for equity,
you say, OK, well, I

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
get the same discounting effect
of the bond, which is bad news,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:90%
goes down.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.265 align:middle line:84%
Ah, but the good news is
the dividend because now

00:41:03.265 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I have more consumers.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, that depends on how much
the Fed dislikes this stuff

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.570 align:middle line:84%
because if the Fed does
this, that means it offsets--

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
it fully offsets the
effect on aggregate demand,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.650 align:middle line:84%
increases the serial shift
[INAUDIBLE] to the right.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.575 align:middle line:84%
That would have
increased output to here.

00:41:20.575 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The Fed doesn't
want more output,

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.325 align:middle line:84%
so it will hike
interest rates up

00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to the point in which
output doesn't go up.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That means dividends are
not going to go up either.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So we get just the negative
effect of the discounting,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and we don't get the benefit
of the extra activity that

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:84%
would have come from
having consumers that are

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:90%
more optimistic and so on, OK?

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- actually,
this has happened

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:90%
a lot over the last few months.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This is an environment
people call--

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
it's an environment where
good news is bad news.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.123 align:middle line:84%
Good news about aggregate
demand, consumers

00:41:53.123 --> 00:41:54.540 align:middle line:84%
are happy, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It's bad news.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Or labor markets are very
tight, wages are going up,

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:84%
all things that sound wonderful
in other environments sound--

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is terrible news for the
financial markets, OK?

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.775 align:middle line:90%
For most, I mean.

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
There is difference in
different sectors and so on.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But for the aggregate, for
the average, it's bad news.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:16.592 align:middle line:84%
So this is an environment where
good news is bad news, good news

00:42:16.592 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:90%
about aggregate demand.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.008 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
specific about what.

00:42:19.008 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Good news about aggregate demand
is bad news for asset markets.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not always like that.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.805 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a recession, the
Fed doesn't want to fight that.

00:42:28.805 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It wants to have more
aggregate demand.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.388 align:middle line:84%
So if you get good news
about aggregate demand,

00:42:32.388 --> 00:42:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that's very good
news for asset prices

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:84%
because the Fed will
not offset that,

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and you get the positive
effect of the extra dividends

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and things of that kind, OK?

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Another component that
moves asset prices a lot--

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.155 align:middle line:84%
so monetary policy moves
asset prices a lot, OK?

00:42:53.155 --> 00:42:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But monetary policy
doesn't happen

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.615 align:middle line:84%
in some separate,
isolated space.

00:42:58.615 --> 00:43:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It reacts to news
about the economy,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
about consumers, about
firms, about regional banks,

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of things, OK?

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Another big driver
of asset prices

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is this guy here, of
equity in particular,

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:90%
is this risk premium.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So that risk premium
can move a lot.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's an important
driver of asset prices.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.650 align:middle line:84%
This index, this is
the-- it's called VIX.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
VIX is-- I'm not going
to explain what it is.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But people call it, so you
get the picture, an index

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:90%
of fear in equity markets.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It's done-- well, I'm not
going to tell you what it is.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's based on option
prices and so on.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is when people
realized that COVID [CHUCKLES]

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.010 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what you see is that
this thing exploded up--

00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
big risk-off, thus a massive
spike in the little xs.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, not surprisingly, look
what happened to equity--

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:90%
collapsed by 35% or so.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Part of that was expected
deviance, blah, blah, blah,

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it
was the risk-off.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's called risk-off when
markets are very fearful.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:20.101 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to take
risks, risk-off, OK?

00:44:20.101 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The recovery, actually,
also had a lot

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with the recovery
on the risk environment.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
People sort of got
used to the thing.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But that recovery
also was a result

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of very aggressive
monetary policy.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The Fed tried to offset this
by cutting interest rates very

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:84%
aggressively, and that also
gave a boost to asset prices.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they did so much
that we ended up with a big--

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
lots of overvaluation
in asset prices.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a result,
when they hiked rates,

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
we had a big decline in
asset prices as a result.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Look, this is--
over the weekend--

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:84%
over the weekend--
we talked about this

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:90%
in the previous lecture.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the First
Republic Bank went under,

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and JPMorgan absorbed it.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.920 align:middle line:90%
So people thought that--

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and Monday was good
because people thought

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.060 align:middle line:90%
that this mini crisis was over.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, yesterday, it turns out
that two other regional banks,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:84%
the shares began to
collapse in the same way

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.200 align:middle line:84%
as the First Republic
Bank shares collapsed

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.590 align:middle line:90%
the week before.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:90%
So panic immediately set in.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So the VIX, the fear index,
[WHISTLES] this is intraday.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So markets open here, And
the shares of these two banks

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.490 align:middle line:90%
began to decline very rapidly.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And so VIX went up a lot.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And what-- this is--

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.160 align:middle line:84%
this is the main-- this
is the SPX, the main--

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.120 align:middle line:90%
S&P 500.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the main price index,
equity price index, in the US--

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.510 align:middle line:90%
immediately declined.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's the xs moving.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Here, xs move up, the little x.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it began to come
down, and the markets

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:90%
began to recover.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So this risk on and off
is a very big driver

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:90%
of equity prices.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.055 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the banks,
actually, that was in trouble.

00:46:35.055 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You see that-- by the end of
the day-- this is PacWest.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.060 align:middle line:84%
PacWest had declined by
28% by the end of the day.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But you see things
look very weird here.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't look
like normal prices.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Here they look
like normal prices.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:90%
They're moving all the time.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Here, they don't.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
that these prices

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.670 align:middle line:84%
decline so rapidly
that they trigger what

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:90%
is called circuit breakers.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot trade those shares
when they decline too rapidly.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's done deliberately
so this little x

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get completely out of
control, people to calm down.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it triggered
it several times.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is
that people calm down,

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] that they don't--

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.570 align:middle line:90%
is there a question?

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.237 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just
on the last slide--

00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:31.195 align:middle line:84%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO:
The previous or this one?

00:47:31.195 --> 00:47:32.640 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the previous one.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Is-- [INAUDIBLE] are either of
them dependent on the other?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.452 align:middle line:84%
Or are they more just showing
the same sort of trend?

00:47:38.452 --> 00:47:39.660 align:middle line:90%
RICARDO J. CABALLERO: No, no.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a good question.

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the risk component only.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is more independent--
what I'm saying,

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.260 align:middle line:84%
when this guy goes up,
if nothing else happens,

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:84%
this will decline because
you are discounting things

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.470 align:middle line:90%
more heavily.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But it is true that there
were some common elements.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There are also common
elements, which

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.300 align:middle line:84%
is people got very worried about
having another regional bank

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:90%
collapsing and so on.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that also created
fear about the economy,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.960 align:middle line:84%
which is an independent
reason for this to decline.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And normally, in
recessions as well,

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.630 align:middle line:90%
this risk appetite is lower.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're right that
it's a common component.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But the point I was highlighting
is that this VIX sort of

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:90%
is a big driver.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It has a big impact
on asset prices.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the cause.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It was an event
that caused both.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that this event
came with this big spike

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:39.530 align:middle line:84%
in the VIX meant that the
impact on the equity index

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:42.842 align:middle line:84%
was larger than if it had been
only news about the economy,

00:48:42.842 --> 00:48:45.050 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there was a
recession ahead or something

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.370 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And let me just finish with
the opposite phenomenon.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I was [INAUDIBLE]
episodes of fear.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes markets
get very carried

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.340 align:middle line:90%
away the opposite direction.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.607 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm showing
you examples.

00:49:01.607 --> 00:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I put together this
picture many years back,

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and now Deutsche Bank
keeps updating it,

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.123 align:middle line:84%
which is it shows you some--
it seems that the world needs

00:49:10.123 --> 00:49:10.915 align:middle line:90%
a bubble somewhere.

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:11.690 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And here, it shows you several
sort of big asset valuations.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Look, 500%.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Here is the Nikkei.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was enormous
appreciation of the Nikkei.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Here was bitcoin.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Then it collapsed.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They always end up bad.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see this
big sort of spiking up,

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.340 align:middle line:84%
they almost always
end up quite poorly.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is-- it's much
more likely that it happens

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:90%
in equity than in bonds.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:84%
In bonds, it cannot happen
because there is a terminal

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.400 align:middle line:90%
date, a terminal value.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with
these kind of things,

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.162 align:middle line:84%
people dream that their
value will go to infinity.

00:49:47.162 --> 00:49:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And it could because the
thing will last to infinity,

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:50.912 align:middle line:84%
and the price could
go to infinity.

00:49:50.912 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:84%
For a bond, that cannot happen,
because there is a terminal

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.495 align:middle line:84%
date, and at that date,
they going to pay you $100.

00:49:55.495 --> 00:49:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So it can't happen.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But for equity, people's
imagination can run very wild.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is a famous
bubble, the South Sea Bubble.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a company in the UK.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's famous for many
reasons, but one of them

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:14.280 align:middle line:84%
is that Isaac Newton got
involved in this one.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:90%
He got carried away.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.440 align:middle line:90%
He sold.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.880 align:middle line:90%
He made a profit.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.810 align:middle line:90%
He sold the shares at 7,000.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.740 align:middle line:84%
He profited 3,500 pounds, which
must have been an enormous

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:90%
amount of money at the time.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Prices kept going up--

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
couldn't resist, went back in,
ended up losing 20,000 pounds,

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.580 align:middle line:84%
which must have
been a lot of money.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So he famously said, "I
can calculate the motions

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:84%
of the heavenly bodies, but
not the madness of people."

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.290 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
expectations, OK?

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.860 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Let me stop here.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:90%
