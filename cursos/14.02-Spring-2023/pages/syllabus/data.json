  "content":" Course Meeting Times Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\nRecitation: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\nPrerequisites There are no prerequisites for this course.\nReadings There is one primary text for the course:\nBlanchard, Oliver. Macroeconomics, 8th edition. Pearson, 2021. ISBN: 9781292351476. There will often be additional reading material. You are also encouraged to read current articles on macroeconomics in The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, or the Financial Times regularly during the semester to stay abreast of economic events, which we will periodically discuss in class.\nEvaluations: Problem Sets and Quizzes The course grade will be based on eight problem sets and three quizzes. Each quiz will count for 25% of the class grade; a combined problem set grade will account for the remaining 25% of the class grade. First quiz: After lecture 10 Second quiz: After lecture 18 Third quiz: At the end of the class Problem sets are mandatory. Problem sets due each Friday will be reviewed in recitation that Friday afternoon. Your overall problem set grade will be determined by dropping the lowest-scoring problem set. This policy is designed to provide some flexibility in managing commitments such as job interviews that may cause conflicts and make it hard to devote sufficient time to some assignments. Any requests for excused waivers for problem sets must be submitted to the Head TA at least one week prior to the problem set deadline.\nGrading Problem sets and quizzes will be graded on a 100-point scale, the weighted average of which will be converted to a class letter grade following this rubric:\n85–100: A range 75–85: B range 65–75: C range 55–65: D range below 55: F Collaboration Policy Collaboration on problem sets is permitted and encouraged, but please write up answers separately and upload them separately. Collaboration on quizzes is strictly prohibited. Any such activity will be considered a breach of academic honesty.\n"}
